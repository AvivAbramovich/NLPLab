I'm very pleased to be here, and I want to acknowledge at the outset that we</p><p end="778" is_meta="false" speaker="Wendy Kaminer" start="720">are all here tonight debating free speech because it is still valued on campus. But it is</p><p end="778" is_meta="false" speaker="Wendy Kaminer" start="720">also true that we are debating free speech because its values are under siege. At the</p><p end="778" is_meta="false" speaker="Wendy Kaminer" start="720">University of South Carolina, students have been investigated for discrimination for</p><p end="778" is_meta="false" speaker="Wendy Kaminer" start="720">advocating free speech, for holding a small free speech event, displaying posters</p><p end="778" is_meta="false" speaker="Wendy Kaminer" start="720">describing recent campus censorship cases. They were investigated after a few students</p><p end="778" is_meta="false" speaker="Wendy Kaminer" start="720">complained that the posters were offensive and triggering.</p><p end="838" is_meta="false" speaker="Wendy Kaminer" start="778">At a California college, students had to go to court to vindicate their right to distribute</p><p end="838" is_meta="false" speaker="Wendy Kaminer" start="778">copies of the Constitution on Constitution Day. These are not anomalous cases. They are</p><p end="838" is_meta="false" speaker="Wendy Kaminer" start="778">typical. Speech policing of faculty, students, and speakers has become routine. You</p><p end="838" is_meta="false" speaker="Wendy Kaminer" start="778">could look it up at TheFire.org. For now, I'd like to review some of the ideas behind his</p><p end="838" is_meta="false" speaker="Wendy Kaminer" start="778">hostility toward free speech. And also, to note the role of government censorship on</p><p end="838" is_meta="false" speaker="Wendy Kaminer" start="778">private as well as public campuses. My partner, Professor McWhorter, will talk about</p><p end="838" is_meta="false" speaker="Wendy Kaminer" start="778">how we regard and respond to ideas. He will elaborate on the meaning of free speech.</p><p end="838" is_meta="false" speaker="Wendy Kaminer" start="778">Campus speech codes date back decades. This is not a new debate. But it has intensified</p><p end="838" is_meta="false" speaker="Wendy Kaminer" start="778">in recent years, partly in response to guidelines issued by the U.S. Department of</p><p end="838" is_meta="false" speaker="Wendy Kaminer" start="778">Education.</p><p end="898" is_meta="false" speaker="Wendy Kaminer" start="838">President Obama has criticized the clampdown on student speech, but his own</p><p end="898" is_meta="false" speaker="Wendy Kaminer" start="838">administration is responsible for some of it. The Education Department has declared</p><p end="898" is_meta="false" speaker="Wendy Kaminer" start="838">that Title IX requires all colleges and universities receiving federal funds -- which is</p><p end="898" is_meta="false" speaker="Wendy Kaminer" start="838">basically all of them -- to restrict verbal harassment, especially sexual harassment, in</p><p end="898" is_meta="false" speaker="Wendy Kaminer" start="838">allegedly hostile environments. The trouble is that the administration defined</p><p end="898" is_meta="false" speaker="Wendy Kaminer" start="838">Intelligence Squared U.S. - 9 - 3/2/2016</p><p end="898" is_meta="false" speaker="Wendy Kaminer" start="838">Prepared by National Capitol Contracting 200 N. Glebe Rd., #1016</p><p end="898" is_meta="false" speaker="Wendy Kaminer" start="838">Arlington, VA 22203</p><p end="898" is_meta="false" speaker="Wendy Kaminer" start="838">harassment quite broadly, more broadly than it has been or should be defined under</p><p end="898" is_meta="false" speaker="Wendy Kaminer" start="838">the First Amendment -- so broadly that it may consist of nothing more than speech of a</p><p end="898" is_meta="false" speaker="Wendy Kaminer" start="838">sexual nature considered unwelcome by some students. Title IX has been turned into an</p><p end="898" is_meta="false" speaker="Wendy Kaminer" start="838">ad hoc national campus speech code, as the investigation of Northwestern professor</p><p end="898" is_meta="false" speaker="Wendy Kaminer" start="838">Laura Kipnis has shown. Kipnis was investigated after publishing an article on sexual</p><p end="898" is_meta="false" speaker="Wendy Kaminer" start="838">politics in the Chronicle of Higher Ed.</p><p end="956" is_meta="false" speaker="Wendy Kaminer" start="898">She's a tenured professor who vigorously challenged the investigation and debunked it</p><p end="956" is_meta="false" speaker="Wendy Kaminer" start="898">in a scathing expose. And she escaped punishment. But it's easy to imagine the effect of</p><p end="956" is_meta="false" speaker="Wendy Kaminer" start="898">this on untenured junior faculty. Now, courts may yet decide the legality of these</p><p end="956" is_meta="false" speaker="Wendy Kaminer" start="898">contested Title IX guidelines, but in the meantime, the government is censoring campus</p><p end="956" is_meta="false" speaker="Wendy Kaminer" start="898">speech. How did this regime evolve? It is partly a response to concern about free</p><p end="956" is_meta="false" speaker="Wendy Kaminer" start="898">speech, and campuses struggling with diversity and the problem of sexual violence. It is</p><p end="956" is_meta="false" speaker="Wendy Kaminer" start="898">practically axiomatic on many campuses that speech considered hateful to</p><p end="956" is_meta="false" speaker="Wendy Kaminer" start="898">disadvantaged or vulnerable students is a form of discrimination or even violence.</p><p end="956" is_meta="false" speaker="Wendy Kaminer" start="898">Whenever people want to restrict speech, they call it "verbal conduct." Free speech is</p><p end="956" is_meta="false" speaker="Wendy Kaminer" start="898">said to be an instrument of privilege used to silence the relatively powerless.</p><p end="1018" is_meta="false" speaker="Wendy Kaminer" start="956">This means that equality requires the unequal distribution of speech rights, but also</p><p end="1018" is_meta="false" speaker="Wendy Kaminer" start="956">means that the right of listeners not to be offended can be elevated over the right to</p><p end="1018" is_meta="false" speaker="Wendy Kaminer" start="956">speak, which means that your right to speak may defend on the unpredictable,</p><p end="1018" is_meta="false" speaker="Wendy Kaminer" start="956">subjective responses of your audience. But free speech can't consist simply of what</p><p end="1018" is_meta="false" speaker="Wendy Kaminer" start="956">people don't mind hearing said. But words are weapons, advocates of restricting hate</p><p end="1018" is_meta="false" speaker="Wendy Kaminer" start="956">speech like to say, and I agree, words are weapons. That's precisely why we protect</p><p end="1018" is_meta="false" speaker="Wendy Kaminer" start="956">them. Weaponized speech is the ideal form of nonviolent political combat. It is</p><p end="1018" is_meta="false" speaker="Wendy Kaminer" start="956">especially important to people in positions of relative powerlessness. It has fueled</p><p end="1018" is_meta="false" speaker="Wendy Kaminer" start="956">virtually every moment for social change and social justice, including today's student</p><p end="1018" is_meta="false" speaker="Wendy Kaminer" start="956">protest movements which you might point to as evidence that free speech is thriving on</p><p end="1018" is_meta="false" speaker="Wendy Kaminer" start="956">campus.</p><p end="1080" is_meta="false" speaker="Wendy Kaminer" start="1018">The trouble is that so many of these movements aim to punish and suppress other</p><p end="1080" is_meta="false" speaker="Wendy Kaminer" start="1018">people's speech by labeling them "micro aggressions," "forms of discrimination." Again,</p><p end="1080" is_meta="false" speaker="Wendy Kaminer" start="1018">it's called "verbal conduct," or even likening it to violence. But there are essential, it</p><p end="1080" is_meta="false" speaker="Wendy Kaminer" start="1018">seems to me, extremely obvious and important differences between the metaphoric</p><p end="1080" is_meta="false" speaker="Wendy Kaminer" start="1018">violence of the word and actual violence. And that's a distinction that is often lost in</p><p end="1080" is_meta="false" speaker="Wendy Kaminer" start="1018">these debates. But when you confuse the metaphoric power of allegedly hateful speech</p><p end="1080" is_meta="false" speaker="Wendy Kaminer" start="1018">with actual violence -- and I think this is important. When you confuse the metaphoric</p><p end="1080" is_meta="false" speaker="Wendy Kaminer" start="1018">power of hate speech with actual violence, you risk justifying the use of violence in</p><p end="1080" is_meta="false" speaker="Wendy Kaminer" start="1018">Intelligence Squared U.S. - 10 - 3/2/2016</p><p end="1080" is_meta="false" speaker="Wendy Kaminer" start="1018">Prepared by National Capitol Contracting 200 N.

So I urge you to vote yes on the motion, that free speech is</p><p end="1080" is_meta="false" speaker="Wendy Kaminer" start="1018">threatened on campus. And I hope you'll agree that that is not a good thing. Thank you.</p><p end="1141" is_meta="true" speaker="Wendy Kaminer" start="1080">applause</p><p end="1141" is_meta="false" speaker="Jason Stanley" start="1080">Wendy, I'm afraid I'm going to have to respectfully disagree with you. Free speech is</p><p end="1141" is_meta="false" speaker="Jason Stanley" start="1080">alive and well in America's universities as you will see if you walk around this</p><p end="1141" is_meta="false" speaker="Jason Stanley" start="1080">campus. Debate and discourse in classrooms, dining halls, dormitories, and even drama</p><p end="1141" is_meta="false" speaker="Jason Stanley" start="1080">school stages, as our gathering tonight proves. Tonight may seem special with the lights</p><p end="1141" is_meta="false" speaker="Jason Stanley" start="1080">and cameras and a distinguished moderator. But what is truly special is that what we</p><p end="1141" is_meta="false" speaker="Jason Stanley" start="1080">are doing is what we are supposed to be doing on campus, thinking, arguing, speaking,</p><p end="1141" is_meta="false" speaker="Jason Stanley" start="1080">listening, agreeing, and disagreeing. And this happens in every imaginable way on</p><p end="1141" is_meta="false" speaker="Jason Stanley" start="1080">campuses across Connecticut and our nation.</p><p end="1204" is_meta="false" speaker="Jason Stanley" start="1141">I teach here as do David Brooks, Stan McChrystal and people of all different political</p><p end="1204" is_meta="false" speaker="Jason Stanley" start="1141">persuasions. We're on a campus, after all, where one of the most popular courses sings</p><p end="1204" is_meta="false" speaker="Jason Stanley" start="1141">the praises of Henry Kissinger. I have debated the Yale Political Union in the past year,</p><p end="1204" is_meta="false" speaker="Jason Stanley" start="1141">so has John Ashcroft and Bob Levy, chairman of the Cato Institute. William F. Buckley's</p><p end="1204" is_meta="false" speaker="Jason Stanley" start="1141">debate with Gore Vidal is a tradition to which Yale -- we Yalees lay proud claim. I'm a</p><p end="1204" is_meta="false" speaker="Jason Stanley" start="1141">philosopher, so I'm going to begin where my tribe often begins, with Aristotle. In book</p><p end="1204" is_meta="false" speaker="Jason Stanley" start="1141">one of "The Politics," Aristotle says that "the gift of speech is given to us to lay -- to lay</p><p end="1204" is_meta="false" speaker="Jason Stanley" start="1141">out the expedient from the inexpedient, the just from the unjust." And these lines are</p><p end="1204" is_meta="false" speaker="Jason Stanley" start="1141">extremely relevant to our current debate. Contemporary students stand accused by</p><p end="1204" is_meta="false" speaker="Jason Stanley" start="1141">some of violating the liberal idea -- ideal of free speech.</p><p end="1259" is_meta="false" speaker="Jason Stanley" start="1204">In fact, many students are using the gift of speech as we western philosophers were</p><p end="1259" is_meta="false" speaker="Jason Stanley" start="1204">taught it was meant to lay out the inexpedient and unjust. As Mark Lamont Hill said on</p><p end="1259" is_meta="false" speaker="Jason Stanley" start="1204">ABC back in November, August 9th, 2014 started everything, right after Michael Brown</p><p end="1259" is_meta="false" speaker="Jason Stanley" start="1204">was killed in Ferguson. We see protests all around the country. And these young</p><p end="1259" is_meta="false" speaker="Jason Stanley" start="1204">Intelligence Squared U.S. - 11 - 3/2/2016</p><p end="1259" is_meta="false" speaker="Jason Stanley" start="1204">Prepared by National Capitol Contracting 200 N. Glebe Rd., #1016</p><p end="1259" is_meta="false" speaker="Jason Stanley" start="1204">Arlington, VA 22203</p><p end="1259" is_meta="false" speaker="Jason Stanley" start="1204">people haven't stopped protesting. They haven't stopped talking, and so we're raising</p><p end="1259" is_meta="false" speaker="Jason Stanley" start="1204">other issues. Police killings of unarmed black citizens began to get more media</p><p end="1259" is_meta="false" speaker="Jason Stanley" start="1204">attention, a catalyst for a social movement that swept the nation, and as always, swept</p><p end="1259" is_meta="false" speaker="Jason Stanley" start="1204">up our campus, campuses with it. We must consider that it is actually the ones who</p><p end="1259" is_meta="false" speaker="Jason Stanley" start="1204">criticize these students for being cry bullies who are the threats to free speech.</p><p end="1316" is_meta="false" speaker="Jason Stanley" start="1259">Some cast today's campus climate as attention between antiracism and free</p><p end="1316" is_meta="false" speaker="Jason Stanley" start="1259">speech. This is a false dichotomy. We've seen this pattern before. Those guilty of</p><p end="1316" is_meta="false" speaker="Jason Stanley" start="1259">something often accuse others of the purported crime. We must consider the</p><p end="1316" is_meta="false" speaker="Jason Stanley" start="1259">possibility that what is really happening is that the language of free speech has been</p><p end="1316" is_meta="false" speaker="Jason Stanley" start="1259">coopted by dominant social groups, distorted to serve their interests, and used to</p><p end="1316" is_meta="false" speaker="Jason Stanley" start="1259">silence the marginalized. All too often when people cry for justice and represent that it</p><p end="1316" is_meta="false" speaker="Jason Stanley" start="1259">threats the free speech, what is really meant is just "be quiet." A senior philosophy</p><p end="1316" is_meta="false" speaker="Jason Stanley" start="1259">major told me that my class was the first in which she had encountered any woman or</p><p end="1316" is_meta="false" speaker="Jason Stanley" start="1259">person of color on the syllabus.</p><p end="1380" is_meta="false" speaker="Jason Stanley" start="1316">And I'm wondering, what's a coddled, safe space then? Is it one in which white men like</p><p end="1380" is_meta="false" speaker="Jason Stanley" start="1316">me are never exposed to the idea that women have minds? Exercising free speech to</p><p end="1380" is_meta="false" speaker="Jason Stanley" start="1316">urge someone not to say or do racist things is not the denial of the right to say racist</p><p end="1380" is_meta="false" speaker="Jason Stanley" start="1316">things. When I ask my mother to stop nagging me -- which I do a lot -- I am not denying</p><p end="1380" is_meta="false" speaker="Jason Stanley" start="1316">her the freedom of speech. Many of us believe racist statements are false. So when we</p><p end="1380" is_meta="false" speaker="Jason Stanley" start="1316">call a statement racist, what we're doing is we're putting into question a perceived</p><p end="1380" is_meta="false" speaker="Jason Stanley" start="1316">falsehood. And how could that be in tension with the mission of the university, which is</p><p end="1380" is_meta="false" speaker="Jason Stanley" start="1316">the pursuit of truth? The act of protesting is not the denial of free speech. It is the</p><p end="1380" is_meta="false" speaker="Jason Stanley" start="1316">exercise of free speech.</p><p end="1441" is_meta="false" speaker="Jason Stanley" start="1380">What's happening on more -- on campuses today is more speech, not less. Voices too</p><p end="1441" is_meta="false" speaker="Jason Stanley" start="1380">often unheard are kept at the margins, are finally being raised and being heard. A</p><p end="1441" is_meta="false" speaker="Jason Stanley" start="1380">central purpose of the university is to allow disputes that too often happen on the</p><p end="1441" is_meta="false" speaker="Jason Stanley" start="1380">battlefield to occur in campus -- on campus and in classrooms instead. I for one am glad</p><p end="1441" is_meta="false" speaker="Jason Stanley" start="1380">that robust discourse, sometimes difficult, is taking place on our campuses. When I hear</p><p end="1441" is_meta="false" speaker="Jason Stanley" start="1380">that student protesters -- protests are silencing and intimidating people, I scratch my</p><p end="1441" is_meta="false" speaker="Jason Stanley" start="1380">head. Students are advocating for open political discussion, sometimes heated, and</p><p end="1441" is_meta="false" speaker="Jason Stanley" start="1380">justice for all. That is what we philosophers were taught freedom of speech is. As a</p><p end="1441" is_meta="false" speaker="Jason Stanley" start="1380">philosopher, it is especially fitting that we debate this topic in a forum much like the one</p><p end="1441" is_meta="false" speaker="Jason Stanley" start="1380">envisages by Aristotle.</p><p end="1508" is_meta="false" speaker="Jason Stanley" start="1441">Intelligence Squared U.S. - 12 - 3/2/2016</p><p end="1508" is_meta="false" speaker="Jason Stanley" start="1441">Prepared by National Capitol Contracting 200 N.

Thank you.</p><p end="1508" is_meta="true" speaker="Jason Stanley" start="1441">applause</p><p end="1859" is_meta="false" speaker="Shaun Harper" start="1804">I recently spoke at a large, predominantly white university, where I met Damien [spelled</p><p end="1859" is_meta="false" speaker="Shaun Harper" start="1804">phonetically], a black undergraduate man who shared with me a disturbing story.</p><p end="1916" is_meta="false" speaker="Shaun Harper" start="1859">Damien was the only non-white person in a large, 200-person lecture-style engineering</p><p end="1916" is_meta="false" speaker="Shaun Harper" start="1859">course. It was a very rigorous course, Damien said. At the beginning of one class session,</p><p end="1916" is_meta="false" speaker="Shaun Harper" start="1859">the professor told seven students who had received perfect scores on a previous test</p><p end="1916" is_meta="false" speaker="Shaun Harper" start="1859">that they were excused from class and exempt from the remaining exams in the</p><p end="1916" is_meta="false" speaker="Shaun Harper" start="1859">sequence, which is a really generous deal, right? As the seven students began to gather</p><p end="1916" is_meta="false" speaker="Shaun Harper" start="1859">their belongings, they walked down the stairs of the lecture hall, one by one. And</p><p end="1916" is_meta="false" speaker="Shaun Harper" start="1859">according to Damien, they had to walk past the professor's podium to get out of the</p><p end="1916" is_meta="false" speaker="Shaun Harper" start="1859">classroom door. Six of them exited the lecture hall uninterrupted.</p><p end="1987" is_meta="false" speaker="Shaun Harper" start="1916">It was only the seventh, Damien, the only black student in the class, who was stopped</p><p end="1987" is_meta="false" speaker="Shaun Harper" start="1916">by the professor, who said to him, "Wait, you got 100 percent?" in a tone of shock and</p><p end="1987" is_meta="false" speaker="Shaun Harper" start="1916">disbelief. Some version of this happens over and over again to students of color on</p><p end="1987" is_meta="false" speaker="Shaun Harper" start="1916">predominantly white campuses. I repeatedly hear stories like this one at just about</p><p end="1987" is_meta="false" speaker="Shaun Harper" start="1916">every single institution where we go -- the center that I direct at Penn, where we go to</p><p end="1987" is_meta="false" speaker="Shaun Harper" start="1916">assess the campus racial climate. Damien was embarrassed. He was hurt. But he said</p><p end="1987" is_meta="false" speaker="Shaun Harper" start="1916">nothing to his professor.

That's not what these speech codes how.</p><p end="2520" is_meta="false" speaker="Wendy Kaminer" start="2457">But that's how they're sometimes enforced. Can I give you one example?</p><p end="2520" is_meta="false" speaker="Wendy Kaminer" start="2457">A Brandeis professor, a tenured Brandies professor, been there for many years, was</p><p end="2520" is_meta="false" speaker="Wendy Kaminer" start="2457">subject to a secret investigation for racial harassment, found secretly guilty of racial</p><p end="2520" is_meta="false" speaker="Wendy Kaminer" start="2457">harassment because he uttered the term "wetback" in class in the course of explaining</p><p end="2520" is_meta="false" speaker="Wendy Kaminer" start="2457">its use as a pejorative. That's not an unusual case. We see cases like this all the time.</p><p end="2589" is_meta="false" speaker="Jason Stanley" start="2520">These are outlier cases, clearly. There's a huge literature in my discipline of philosophy</p><p end="2589" is_meta="false" speaker="Jason Stanley" start="2520">on slurs, and there's two different theoretical positions that if you are using the slur,</p><p end="2589" is_meta="false" speaker="Jason Stanley" start="2520">then you -- then -- then you also aren't -- if you're mentioning the slur, just, you know,</p><p end="2589" is_meta="false" speaker="Jason Stanley" start="2520">you're talking about the word, then you're still slurring, and the other view says, "No,</p><p end="2589" is_meta="false" speaker="Jason Stanley" start="2520">you're not slurring." So I have been at a million talks, discussions. I've taught classes</p><p end="2589" is_meta="false" speaker="Jason Stanley" start="2520">where I and others have used many slurs. I've taught at five different university</p><p end="2589" is_meta="false" speaker="Jason Stanley" start="2520">campuses, from state universities to Ivy League campuses. So I'm just not seeing the</p><p end="2589" is_meta="false" speaker="Jason Stanley" start="2520">point about slurring. And some of the other cases -- can I address one case that Wendy</p><p end="2589" is_meta="false" speaker="Jason Stanley" start="2520">mentioned in her opening remarks?</p><p end="2589" is_meta="false" speaker="Jason Stanley" start="2520">Intelligence Squared U.S. - 19 - 3/2/2016</p><p end="2589" is_meta="false" speaker="Jason Stanley" start="2520">Prepared by National Capitol Contracting 200 N.

But I think to take that</p><p end="2635" is_meta="false" speaker="Jason Stanley" start="2589">very complicated personal case and use it as some kind of example is wrong to --</p><p end="2695" is_meta="false" speaker="Shaun Harper" start="2635">Yeah, I couldn't disagree more.</p><p end="2762" is_meta="false" speaker="Shaun Harper" start="2695">I mean, listen, there are over 5,000 colleges and universities in the country, and many of</p><p end="2762" is_meta="false" speaker="Shaun Harper" start="2695">their presidents say reckless things, and they are not being called to resign or demanded</p><p end="2762" is_meta="false" speaker="Shaun Harper" start="2695">to resign as was the case that you laid out at Claremont McKenna. So I agree with my</p><p end="2762" is_meta="false" speaker="Shaun Harper" start="2695">debate partner here that the examples that are being cited are -- they're outliers. And I</p><p end="2762" is_meta="false" speaker="Shaun Harper" start="2695">would love to know how the story concludes with the Brandis professor. Was the</p><p end="2762" is_meta="false" speaker="Shaun Harper" start="2695">person fired? So the person was apparently, secretly investigated for saying these</p><p end="2762" is_meta="false" speaker="Shaun Harper" start="2695">things. Well, you know, I met a student last week who told me that his professor, on the</p><p end="2762" is_meta="false" speaker="Shaun Harper" start="2695">first day of class, looked into the audience and said, "I want all of the pretty women to</p><p end="2762" is_meta="false" speaker="Shaun Harper" start="2695">sit in the first two rows of class." That professor -- somebody should probably pull him</p><p end="2762" is_meta="false" speaker="Shaun Harper" start="2695">aside and say that, you can't say these kinds of things to women because not only is it</p><p end="2762" is_meta="false" speaker="Shaun Harper" start="2695">offensive to the women, it's also instructive to everyone else in the audience, all of the</p><p end="2762" is_meta="false" speaker="Shaun Harper" start="2695">men. It says to the men that, yeah, it's okay for you to leave from here and go off into</p><p end="2762" is_meta="false" speaker="Shaun Harper" start="2695">the world and become a Congress person or a CEO or something, and say these things</p><p end="2762" is_meta="false" speaker="Shaun Harper" start="2695">to women, without any sort of consequence. So --</p><p end="2816" is_meta="false" speaker="Wendy Kaminer" start="2762">I will yield to him for a moment, and then I want to make a point.</p><p end="2816" is_meta="true" speaker="Wendy Kaminer" start="2762">talking simultaneously</p><p end="2816" is_meta="false" speaker="Wendy Kaminer" start="2762">I just want to say quickly that --</p><p end="2816" is_meta="true" speaker="Wendy Kaminer" start="2762">applause</p><p end="2816" is_meta="false" speaker="Wendy Kaminer" start="2762">-- I think in many ways we're talking past each other.</p><p end="2884" is_meta="false" speaker="Wendy Kaminer" start="2816">You guys have suggested that we are somehow saying that student protests are</p><p end="2884" is_meta="false" speaker="Wendy Kaminer" start="2816">violations of free speech. I strongly defend the right of students to protest anything</p><p end="2884" is_meta="false" speaker="Wendy Kaminer" start="2816">they want to protest in however many uncivil terms they want to use. The problem is</p><p end="2884" is_meta="false" speaker="Wendy Kaminer" start="2816">that a lot of these protests are aimed not at trying to convince other people not to use</p><p end="2884" is_meta="false" speaker="Wendy Kaminer" start="2816">certain kinds of language but to try to get them punished for using language, to try to</p><p end="2884" is_meta="false" speaker="Wendy Kaminer" start="2816">get administrative sanctions, to -- you know, that -- to try to enforce these multiple</p><p end="2884" is_meta="false" speaker="Wendy Kaminer" start="2816">speech codes that prohibit this kind of language.</p><p end="2884" is_meta="false" speaker="Jason Stanley" start="2816">So it is true that campus codes did make the 13 list. If you look at all the student</p><p end="2884" is_meta="false" speaker="Jason Stanley" start="2816">demands across the country, in the top 13 campus codes, a demand for campus codes</p><p end="2884" is_meta="false" speaker="Jason Stanley" start="2816">was 12th, mentioned by a tiny fraction. But I just want to mention what I think is the</p><p end="2884" is_meta="false" speaker="Jason Stanley" start="2816">underlying issue here, and it's hit by John in his opening remarks, leftism.</p><p end="2938" is_meta="false" speaker="Jason Stanley" start="2884">Intelligence Squared U.S. - 22 - 3/2/2016</p><p end="2938" is_meta="false" speaker="Jason Stanley" start="2884">Prepared by National Capitol Contracting 200 N.

You</p><p end="4323" is_meta="false" speaker="Shaun Harper" start="4254">certainly -- I am sure of it -- don't want to move into a neighborhood when you leave</p><p end="4323" is_meta="false" speaker="Shaun Harper" start="4254">here from Yale -- and have just some ridiculous flags flying from your house and not at</p><p end="4323" is_meta="false" speaker="Shaun Harper" start="4254">least know that it's offensive to your neighbors. Now, no one may make you take your</p><p end="4323" is_meta="false" speaker="Shaun Harper" start="4254">flag down, but you probably at least want to have some awareness that you are about</p><p end="4323" is_meta="false" speaker="Shaun Harper" start="4254">to go into the world and put certain symbols on places where you live in community</p><p end="4323" is_meta="false" speaker="Shaun Harper" start="4254">with others that could offend them. That's all.</p><p end="4376" is_meta="true" speaker="Shaun Harper" start="4323">applause</p><p end="4376" is_meta="false" speaker="Jason Stanley" start="4323">Yes.</p><p end="4376" is_meta="false" speaker="Jason Stanley" start="4323">The people -- free speech allows us to protest people coming to campus. That's part of</p><p end="4376" is_meta="false" speaker="Jason Stanley" start="4323">free speech. You know, if you restricted Facebook pages like that, you would be against</p><p end="4376" is_meta="false" speaker="Jason Stanley" start="4323">free speech.</p><p end="4438" is_meta="true" speaker="Jason Stanley" start="4376">applause</p><p end="4438" is_meta="false" speaker="Shaun Harper" start="4376">Yes. Yes. What he just said. Exactly.</p><p end="4438" is_meta="false" speaker="Wendy Kaminer" start="4376">But -- you know --</p><p end="4438" is_meta="false" speaker="Shaun Harper" start="4376">No, listen. I get invited to dozens of college campuses every year to give speeches.</p><p end="4438" is_meta="false" speaker="Shaun Harper" start="4376">Maybe there's a Facebook group that doesn't want me there, right? But it would be a</p><p end="4438" is_meta="false" speaker="Shaun Harper" start="4376">threat to free speech to say that those students couldn't have that --</p><p end="4500" is_meta="false" speaker="Wendy Kaminer" start="4438">No. It's -- of course students have a right to say he's not allowed to come. But to do that</p><p end="4500" is_meta="false" speaker="Wendy Kaminer" start="4438">shows an intolerance for free speech. It suggests that -- and you'll hear this kind of</p><p end="4500" is_meta="false" speaker="Wendy Kaminer" start="4438">language, "He shouldn't come because it violates our safe space." "He shouldn't come</p><p end="4500" is_meta="false" speaker="Wendy Kaminer" start="4438">because it's harassing." We had the example of a debate about rape culture at Brown</p><p end="4500" is_meta="false" speaker="Wendy Kaminer" start="4438">University between two feminists, which was protested as violating the safety of</p><p end="4500" is_meta="false" speaker="Wendy Kaminer" start="4438">survivors of sexual assault. And so, they established a separate room for people to go to</p><p end="4500" is_meta="false" speaker="Wendy Kaminer" start="4438">so that they could have some comfort while this debate was going on. You know, they</p><p end="4500" is_meta="false" speaker="Wendy Kaminer" start="4438">had a right to do that, but it shows an intolerance for free speech, you know --</p><p end="4500" is_meta="false" speaker="Wendy Kaminer" start="4438">-- a desire not to hear --</p><p end="4500" is_meta="false" speaker="Wendy Kaminer" start="4438">-- opposing views.</p><p end="4555" is_meta="false" speaker="Jason Stanley" start="4500">I --</p><p end="4555" is_meta="false" speaker="Jason Stanley" start="4500">That specific position reflects an intolerance of free speech. And we don't know how</p><p end="4555" is_meta="false" speaker="Jason Stanley" start="4500">many students were on the Facebook page. But I am a free speech absolutist. And</p><p end="4555" is_meta="false" speaker="Jason Stanley" start="4500">people are really coming dangerously close to asking that no such Facebook post pages</p><p end="4555" is_meta="false" speaker="Jason Stanley" start="4500">be made. And I really think, for any speaker, students have the right to protest that</p><p end="4555" is_meta="false" speaker="Jason Stanley" start="4500">speaker's coming.</p><p end="4555" is_meta="false" speaker="Wendy Kaminer" start="4500">Well, that is something we all agree upon.</p><p end="4618" is_meta="false" speaker="Wendy Kaminer" start="4555">We have just been talking about an intolerance for speakers with dissenting views. A</p><p end="4618" is_meta="false" speaker="Wendy Kaminer" start="4555">few days ago, I spoke to Zachary Wood, who is a Williams College sophomore who runs</p><p end="4618" is_meta="false" speaker="Wendy Kaminer" start="4555">the controversial Uncomfortable Learning series. Recently, the president of Williams</p><p end="4618" is_meta="false" speaker="Wendy Kaminer" start="4555">Intelligence Squared U.S. - 41 - 3/2/2016</p><p end="4618" is_meta="false" speaker="Wendy Kaminer" start="4555">Prepared by National Capitol Contracting 200 N. Glebe Rd., #1016</p><p end="4618" is_meta="false" speaker="Wendy Kaminer" start="4555">Arlington, VA 22203</p><p end="4618" is_meta="false" speaker="Wendy Kaminer" start="4555">summarily canceled an appearance by an Uncomfortable Learning speaker who was</p><p end="4618" is_meta="false" speaker="Wendy Kaminer" start="4555">charged with making racist remarks. Zachary is an African-American who identifies as a</p><p end="4618" is_meta="false" speaker="Wendy Kaminer" start="4555">liberal Democrat. He's also a strong proponent of free speech. He wants to expose</p><p end="4618" is_meta="false" speaker="Wendy Kaminer" start="4555">himself and other students with dissenting, even obnoxious views. It's a matter, he</p><p end="4618" is_meta="false" speaker="Wendy Kaminer" start="4555">says, of preparing students to articulate differences of opinion. Now people tend to</p><p end="4618" is_meta="false" speaker="Wendy Kaminer" start="4555">resort to name calling instead.</p><p end="4682" is_meta="false" speaker="Wendy Kaminer" start="4618">And in fact, some of the same students who protest the Uncomfortable Learning series</p><p end="4682" is_meta="false" speaker="Wendy Kaminer" start="4618">as harassing or threatening have vilified Zach as an Uncle Tom and targeted him with</p><p end="4682" is_meta="false" speaker="Wendy Kaminer" start="4618">implicit threats, he reports. Twice, he's received notes under his door saying, "You will</p><p end="4682" is_meta="false" speaker="Wendy Kaminer" start="4618">see your blood in the leaves." A Facebook posting said, "We need the oil and the switch</p><p end="4682" is_meta="false" speaker="Wendy Kaminer" start="4618">to deal with him at this midnight hour." He says what's most distressing about that are</p><p end="4682" is_meta="false" speaker="Wendy Kaminer" start="4618">the number of likes he sees posted by other black students. "They talk about me with</p><p end="4682" is_meta="false" speaker="Wendy Kaminer" start="4618">slave dialect," he says. Zach says that he gets private expressions of support from other</p><p end="4682" is_meta="false" speaker="Wendy Kaminer" start="4618">students who say they don't want to speak out publicly. This is what happens when you</p><p end="4682" is_meta="false" speaker="Wendy Kaminer" start="4618">demonize expression of unwelcome views. You create communities of frightened</p><p end="4682" is_meta="false" speaker="Wendy Kaminer" start="4618">conformists. Williams College is not an outlier. Zachary Wood is an outlier who</p><p end="4682" is_meta="false" speaker="Wendy Kaminer" start="4618">practices what many on campus only preach, a consistent commitment to free speech.</p><p end="4743" is_meta="false" speaker="Wendy Kaminer" start="4682">And so I ask you to recognize Zachary's experience, to recognize the experiences of</p><p end="4743" is_meta="false" speaker="Wendy Kaminer" start="4682">other students like him and vote yes on the motion.</p><p end="4743" is_meta="false" speaker="Jason Stanley" start="4682">I want to again return to my view of what a university is. It's a place where we replace</p><p end="4743" is_meta="false" speaker="Jason Stanley" start="4682">disputes that usually used to take place or usually do take place on the battlefield with</p><p end="4743" is_meta="false" speaker="Jason Stanley" start="4682">disputes that take place in the classroom. That means that those disputes are going to</p><p end="4743" is_meta="false" speaker="Jason Stanley" start="4682">hurt, and they're going to wound, and they're going to be personal. And that is what it</p><p end="4743" is_meta="false" speaker="Jason Stanley" start="4682">is to be a university. So when people talk of shaming, I mean, it's tough, and we have to</p><p end="4743" is_meta="false" speaker="Jason Stanley" start="4682">have to have tolerance for each other, and we have to understand that this is what</p><p end="4743" is_meta="false" speaker="Jason Stanley" start="4682">political debate is about.</p><p end="4804" is_meta="false" speaker="Jason Stanley" start="4743">Intelligence Squared U.S. - 42 - 3/2/2016</p><p end="4804" is_meta="false" speaker="Jason Stanley" start="4743">Prepared by National Capitol Contracting 200 N.

I mean, diversity is being</p><p end="4804" is_meta="false" speaker="Jason Stanley" start="4743">discussed everywhere. The Oscars just happened. I mean -- am I really understanding</p><p end="4804" is_meta="false" speaker="Jason Stanley" start="4743">what's going on? The college campuses are the only place discussing diversity? Yet on</p><p end="4804" is_meta="false" speaker="Jason Stanley" start="4743">college campuses, there's some specific problem? Free speech is not threatened by</p><p end="4804" is_meta="false" speaker="Jason Stanley" start="4743">students voicing their concerns about social justice issues, even in strongly emotional</p><p end="4804" is_meta="false" speaker="Jason Stanley" start="4743">terms. It's threatened by calling those people bullies, representing them as</p><p end="4804" is_meta="false" speaker="Jason Stanley" start="4743">authoritarians and really frightening and like North Korea. It's threatened by</p><p end="4804" is_meta="false" speaker="Jason Stanley" start="4743">representing claims of injustice as psychiatric problems and weaknesses. And it's</p><p end="4804" is_meta="false" speaker="Jason Stanley" start="4743">threatened by belittling the students' ability to tolerate debate, often emotional, often</p><p end="4804" is_meta="false" speaker="Jason Stanley" start="4743">tough, with each other.</p><p end="4857" is_meta="false" speaker="Jason Stanley" start="4804">And I think that's what we see on college campuses today. I've learned from all my</p><p end="4857" is_meta="false" speaker="Jason Stanley" start="4804">students, from all different political perspectives, so I urge you to vote against the</p><p end="4857" is_meta="false" speaker="Jason Stanley" start="4804">motion.</p><p end="4980" is_meta="false" speaker="Shaun Harper" start="4922">Given the time and limitations of this debate format, I cannot give you the crushing</p><p end="4980" is_meta="false" speaker="Shaun Harper" start="4922">weight of evidence that I have heard from students, thousands of them, who have</p><p end="4980" is_meta="false" speaker="Shaun Harper" start="4922">participated in my studies about the experiences that they have on their campuses, not</p><p end="4980" is_meta="false" speaker="Shaun Harper" start="4922">just experiences in encounters with racism, but also with sexism, homophobia,</p><p end="4980" is_meta="false" speaker="Shaun Harper" start="4922">Islamophobia and other forms of harassment in this respect that target and undermine</p><p end="4980" is_meta="false" speaker="Shaun Harper" start="4922">their humanity and sense of belonging on the campus.</p><p end="5039" is_meta="false" speaker="Shaun Harper" start="4980">I don't have enough time to do that. They're not anecdotes, they're data. They're</p><p end="5039" is_meta="false" speaker="Shaun Harper" start="4980">people's lived experiences and realities. And as it turns out, those people have had</p><p end="5039" is_meta="false" speaker="Shaun Harper" start="4980">enough. They're standing up for themselves. They are finally exercising their freedom</p><p end="5039" is_meta="false" speaker="Shaun Harper" start="4980">of speech. For years and years and years, those people sat silent and did not say</p><p end="5039" is_meta="false" speaker="Shaun Harper" start="4980">anything to the professor who said, "You must be in the wrong classroom." Now all of a</p><p end="5039" is_meta="false" speaker="Shaun Harper" start="4980">sudden, they're saying, do you know what? What you're saying feels racist to me. And</p><p end="5039" is_meta="false" speaker="Shaun Harper" start="4980">now, suddenly, that professor who probably -- well, she's dead now. But professors like</p><p end="5039" is_meta="false" speaker="Shaun Harper" start="4980">her are being held accountable. No one is saying to people that you cannot say</p><p end="5039" is_meta="false" speaker="Shaun Harper" start="4980">ridiculous things. What they are saying is that you are going to be held accountable for</p><p end="5039" is_meta="false" speaker="Shaun Harper" start="4980">them.
