The system isn't going to change itself from inside. And it's going to need outside pressure. And that should be communities. It should be activist physicians. It should be patients. It should be everybody who's involved in healthcare. And that's everybody.</p><p end="180" is_meta="false" speaker="Shannon Brownlee" start="127">Oh, my partner is my friend and esteemed colleague Robby Pearl, an author a great book, "Mistreated".</p><p end="427" is_meta="false" speaker="Shannon Brownlee" start="365">I think this is my one opportunity to feel like a model, is walking down that runway. [laughter] So you&#8217;re going to vote on a single premise, but in fact there are two ideas in that premise, and one of them is you have to ask yourself the question just how broken is the system anyway. And my partner Robby Pearl and I agree that it is incredibly broken. If it were a patient, if the healthcare system were a patient, we would have put it in the ICU long ago. But the second thing you must decide is whether or not the reforms that are in place can revive that patient. And we agree again, Robby and I, it can&#8217;t. They can&#8217;t. It is in worse shape than our opponents are going to argue, and we think the reforms are less than adequate. So my job is to paint a picture of the system that is, and Robby will lay out a great system that could be, and what it will take to get there.</p><p end="489" is_meta="false" speaker="Shannon Brownlee" start="427">Now I warn you the picture I&#8217;m going to paint isn&#8217;t very pretty, and some of you, especially those of you who work in organized salaried group practices like Mayo, like Kaiser, like Geisinger, may think I&#8217;m exaggerating. But you are islands of excellence in a sea of mediocrity, and out there it&#8217;s a bit of a warzone. We have fragmented care. We have burned out physicians and nurses. We have three -- a quarter of a million patients die every year of errors, nosocomial infection, and adverse drug events. We&#8217;ve had a record number of drug recalls in the last decade, in part because we have an FDA that is a captive agency. It&#8217;s bought and paid for by the industry that it&#8217;s supposed to be regulating. We have -- and don&#8217;t get me started on medical devices. We have tragic care for the elderly. We&#8217;ve almost killed primary care. And we&#8217;re still paying fee-for-service even though we know that fee-for-service rewards more care, not better care.</p><p end="543" is_meta="false" speaker="Shannon Brownlee" start="489">It&#8217;s kind of like paying for a car based on the number of parts in the car. And we still do not have universal coverage. Meanwhile costs are out of control. They're out of control because prices are out of control. And it's not just drug companies that are the problem. It's that everybody is charging what the market will bear. Costs are also out of control because of how much we waste on fraud, on administration, on inefficiency, and on my special interest overtreatment. We spend about $300 billion a year on services that patients don't need. And when you add it all up the waste is about $1 trillion, $1 trillion. So costs are also out of control because we have massively overinvested in the hospital sector and underinvested in primary care and community based care.</p><p end="608" is_meta="false" speaker="Shannon Brownlee" start="543">It's because -- and hospitals are now consolidating as fastest that they can in order to capture market share and drive up prices even higher. They are investing in technology and specialty care, not because that's good for the community, because it's good for their bottom line. So I'll give you an example. I live in Washington, D.C., and two hospitals have proton beam machines and two more are building them. Now this is a $100 million machine that has been shown to be effective -- more effective than standard radiation therapy for a handful of cancers. At most we need one proton beam machine in Washington. In fact really we don't need any because we've got two in Baltimore which is 30 miles away.</p><p end="608" is_meta="false" speaker="Shannon Brownlee" start="543">So hospitals are saying to heck with the evidence. If it's good for the bottom line we're going to invest. As long as we keep paying free-for-service, hospitals are going to be thinking more about margin than they are about mission. Now are ACOs going to right-size our hospital sector?</p><p end="666" is_meta="false" speaker="Shannon Brownlee" start="608">So in 2012 we had 32 pioneer ACOs. Today we have eight. The other 24 dropped out because they didn't like the risk. And you can't blame them. When most of your book of business is in feefor-service and a small part of it as risk it's like having one foot in two different canoes.</p><p end="666" is_meta="false" speaker="Shannon Brownlee" start="608">So every one of these problems is fixable. But they should be seen not as isolated ailments. They're kind of -- they're a kind of sepsis. They're systemic failures requiring systemic solutions. But the majority of actors out there, what Robby calls the legacy players, the hospitals, the drug companies, the AAMC, the device makers, the insurers, they aren't going to like systemic solutions very much. And they are resisting a lot of these solutions. And they won't fix the problems that exist until they have to.</p><p end="727" is_meta="false" speaker="Shannon Brownlee" start="666">So hospitals bundle payments. They're not going to change hospital costs appreciably. They're going to -- they're going to be an incentive to deliver more bundles. And then there's Medicare for all. Now I hate saying this as a card-carrying Bernie supporter and a supporter of single payer. But if we do Medicare for all that just pays fee-for-service or worse pays fee for service and has Medicare fees go up to what private pay we're in trouble.</p><p end="727" is_meta="false" speaker="Shannon Brownlee" start="666">Now our opponents are going to give you examples of incredible care, fantastic primary care, fantastic -- fantastic medical records. Many many wonderful innovations. But the problem is these are million dollar solutions to a trillion dollar problem. And they are not going to scale up. They are one-offs. So given this I think that you have to vote in favor of the premise. The American healthcare system is terminally broken. Thank you.</p><p end="2104" is_meta="false" speaker="Shannon Brownlee" start="2047">Well, you know, I&#8217;ve been around a long time and reporting on healthcare for a long time when I was a reporter, back when I was a reporter. And we&#8217;ve seen periods of ferment in healthcare before, and each time there are these incredible points of light, and I don&#8217;t argue them at all. They are fantastic, and there are a lot of them. But somehow, the existing legacy players somehow manage to beat it back. Why is this time different?</p><p end="2345" is_meta="false" speaker="Shannon Brownlee" start="2289">Tell me how --</p><p end="2345" is_meta="false" speaker="Shannon Brownlee" start="2289">-- how does Kaiser --</p><p end="2345" is_meta="false" speaker="Shannon Brownlee" start="2289">-- how is Kaiser Geisinger -- Geisinger better? How is Geisinger going to make -- make inroads in Pittsburgh?</p><p end="2345" is_meta="false" speaker="Shannon Brownlee" start="2289">You're not going to answer the question.</p><p end="2345" is_meta="false" speaker="Shannon Brownlee" start="2289">Yeah.</p><p end="2345" is_meta="false" speaker="Shannon Brownlee" start="2289">How is it --</p><p end="2345" is_meta="false" speaker="Shannon Brownlee" start="2289">-- going to make an inroad in --</p><p end="2345" is_meta="false" speaker="Shannon Brownlee" start="2289">Okay.</p><p end="2407" is_meta="false" speaker="Shannon Brownlee" start="2345">Yeah. But you've got to read the whole book to find out, David, that it's -</p><p end="2407" is_meta="false" speaker="Shannon Brownlee" start="2345">-- not going to happen in Pittsburgh.</p><p end="2407" is_meta="false" speaker="Shannon Brownlee" start="2345">We're not saying it's dead.</p><p end="2467" is_meta="false" speaker="Shannon Brownlee" start="2407">Okay. I think this metaphor --</p><p end="2467" is_meta="false" speaker="Shannon Brownlee" start="2407">-- too far.</p><p end="2467" is_meta="false" speaker="Shannon Brownlee" start="2407">This metaphor has gone too far. It's time to --</p><p end="2467" is_meta="false" speaker="Shannon Brownlee" start="2407">-- call a moratorium on the patient, the healthcare system as a patient in the ICU.</p><p end="2587" is_meta="false" speaker="Shannon Brownlee" start="2529">And by the way, Hawaii is a -- a very, very interesting place because there's really only two insurers. Well, there's Medicare. But there is HMSA, which is the Blue Cross/Blue Shield, and there is Kaiser. And that's -- and it's a -- that actually makes a difference.</p><p end="2587" is_meta="false" speaker="Shannon Brownlee" start="2529">Which primary care doctors loath.</p><p end="2642" is_meta="false" speaker="Shannon Brownlee" start="2587">I know. Which point do we respond to? There's so many coming In a streak.</p><p end="2642" is_meta="false" speaker="Shannon Brownlee" start="2587">Yes.</p><p end="2765" is_meta="false" speaker="Shannon Brownlee" start="2707">Well, I'd like to make a couple --</p><p end="2765" is_meta="false" speaker="Shannon Brownlee" start="2707">-- just a couple, and then I want David --</p><p end="2765" is_meta="false" speaker="Shannon Brownlee" start="2707">Number one, Zeke, I'm not saying that you look after a year and you say, "Oh, not working. It's terminal." That's not true. That's not what we're saying. It's that it is a massive, massive problem. Number two, it does take time. And number three, we have one state that's globally budgeted all of its hospitals. And it's going along pretty well. It's not like they have suddenly become all -- everybody's at risk instantly. They're moving slowly. It's the state of Maryland. But they're getting there. But it took -- it took a big shift in somebody saying, from the top, "We're not going to pay you fee for service anymore. We're not going to pay the same way."</p><p end="3120" is_meta="false" speaker="Shannon Brownlee" start="3069">You know, I actually -- I find myself agreeing with a great deal of what our opponents say. I think --</p><p end="3120" is_meta="false" speaker="Shannon Brownlee" start="3069">Not at the moment. But the piece that's really important that you just said, Zeke, which is that the innovation is bubble -- has to bubble up from underneath. But there are some things that have to be imposed from above. And the shift in payment has to be imposed.</p><p end="3189" is_meta="false" speaker="Shannon Brownlee" start="3120">So who's going to do the imposing? Medicare hasn't done it yet. I'm hoping at some point it's going to move to some kind of global budgeting for hospitals, and that it's going to start giving -- it's going to start putting physicians at risk. But are the private plans really going to move this direction? Are they going to do it? And are they going to do it in a way &#8211;</p><p end="3189" is_meta="false" speaker="Shannon Brownlee" start="3120">I know.</p><p end="3189" is_meta="false" speaker="Shannon Brownlee" start="3120">Maybe we should see and look -- look and see what happens in the state of Maryland.</p><p end="3541" is_meta="false" speaker="Shannon Brownlee" start="3483">Yes.</p><p end="3541" is_meta="false" speaker="Shannon Brownlee" start="3483">No. I'd like to address that question.</p><p end="3541" is_meta="false" speaker="Shannon Brownlee" start="3483">It is -- it's absolutely imperative. Healthcare is effectively robbing state and local governments of the ability to pay for education, to pay for roads, to pay for social services. And it's -- and it's the waste in the system that's so extraordinary. So we're basically paying for proton beam machines in Washington, D.C., but we're not improving private -- we're not improving public schools in Northeast and Southeast Washington. And the question that I think we have to answer is what's the mechanism going to be for that transfer of that money?</p><p end="3607" is_meta="false" speaker="Shannon Brownlee" start="3541">So if venture capitalists come in and do a lot of -- a number of the things that Zeke is talking about were funded by venture capitalists. Because they're smart. They see $1 trillion of waste in that system and they want to put at least some of it in their own pockets. They're not going to be giving it back to those communities. They don't want to give it back to the states and local governments. So what's the mechanism that's going to work? Is it democracy in this country? That's not working so well either. So we have to have this alliance I think between the good doctors and the good nurses and the good CEOs of hospitals, et cetera, et cetera, who want to see that change, and employers, and patients, and people in communities.</p><p end="3675" is_meta="false" speaker="Shannon Brownlee" start="3607">Is the -- is the -- I have no idea. I can't answer that question. Sorry.</p><p end="3849" is_meta="false" speaker="Shannon Brownlee" start="3781">But I'm going to disagree with one thing. I don't think that it's -- I don't think that having the hospital do that is the right way we ought to be doing that.</p><p end="3912" is_meta="true" speaker="Shannon Brownlee" start="3849">applause</p><p end="3912" is_meta="false" speaker="Shannon Brownlee" start="3849">I mean, that's -- that is a Band-Aid on a social problem.</p><p end="3912" is_meta="false" speaker="Shannon Brownlee" start="3849">It's simply that -- that when health care is -- is effectively robbing our state and local and federal governments of the money to be able to do -- to provide these kinds of services, to provide education, to provide housing, et cetera, et cetera, then we have to find a way to extract the money out of the system. We can't just have -- keep the money in the health care system and then have it do its little bit for, you know, giving to community services and giving a little bit to housing.</p><p end="3912" is_meta="false" speaker="Shannon Brownlee" start="3849">Kaiser could have done a lot more.</p><p end="3962" is_meta="false" speaker="Shannon Brownlee" start="3912">But it's not. Kaiser made a billion dollars in profit last year.</p><p end="3962" is_meta="false" speaker="Shannon Brownlee" start="3912">And they put 3 percent into -- into food?</p><p end="3962" is_meta="false" speaker="Shannon Brownlee" start="3912">Okay.</p><p end="4140" is_meta="false" speaker="Shannon Brownlee" start="4089">I don't think it's necessary, but I don't think it's a bad idea. You could have your -- all your banking information on a little card.</p><p end="4260" is_meta="false" speaker="Shannon Brownlee" start="4208">How many are uninsured today?</p><p end="4501" is_meta="false" speaker="Shannon Brownlee" start="4440">So, but there&#8217;s another problem with the quality metrics. A whole heck of a lot of them don&#8217;t have anything to do with actually improving patients&#8217; health.</p><p end="4562" is_meta="false" speaker="Shannon Brownlee" start="4501">They are -- the metrics that we have -- and so I think quality metrics are probably not a bad idea, but let&#8217;s get the metrics that actually matter to patients&#8217; health and let&#8217;s not have quality metrics that drive physicians to do things that are actually counterproductive, which is what&#8217;s happening to many -- with many of these metrics.</p><p end="4562" is_meta="false" speaker="Shannon Brownlee" start="4501">I don&#8217;t see it.</p><p end="4820" is_meta="false" speaker="Shannon Brownlee" start="4742">You said three minutes.</p><p end="4820" is_meta="false" speaker="Shannon Brownlee" start="4742">Yes.</p><p end="4820" is_meta="false" speaker="Shannon Brownlee" start="4742">Okay.</p><p end="4820" is_meta="false" speaker="Shannon Brownlee" start="4742">Thanks. So I think Zeke has kind of painted me and Robby as the bad news bears. It's all doomed. Everything's terrible. Everything's lost. And in fact that's not the way I think. That's not what I believe. I believe we can have a truly great and uniquely American healthcare system. And not because Winston Churchill once said Americans eventually come to the right answer but only after trying everything else.</p><p end="4861" is_meta="false" speaker="Shannon Brownlee" start="4820">We can have a great healthcare system because of all the examples that Zeke and David have brought up. And we can have a great healthcare system I believe because of all the physicians I know. There's three of them in this -- on this stage who -- and the nurses and the physicians assistants and the pharmacists and the regulators? There are all kinds of people in healthcare who absolutely committed to making a better system. The problem isn't a deficit of know-how and the problem isn't a lack of good intentions. It's what it's going to take to move the entire system.</p><p end="4923" is_meta="false" speaker="Shannon Brownlee" start="4861">And many of the examples that Zeke offered are dependent on venture capital. They're -- or they're dependent on somebody investing money up front. And I want to see that money return to communities. I want to see that money return to patients. I think that money needs to be returned to state and local budgets.</p><p end="4923" is_meta="false" speaker="Shannon Brownlee" start="4861">And that's one of the pieces that we haven't figured out. David has made the point very clearly and very eloquently that the health really is going to lie in these social determinants. That healthcare needs to be reserved for taking care of people when they are sick, but we can prevent a great deal of that by reinvesting that money. And we can't do that right now if it's being sucked up by the healthcare system. But the really big issue here is this need for a radically different system is not going to become a reality until we become honest about what's really wrong with the system.</p><p end="4982" is_meta="false" speaker="Shannon Brownlee" start="4923">Now we all know what's wrong with the system. We all know what's wrong with the system out in the audience. But the American public doesn't get it yet. And we need to start talking to them. And I want people to get out of their clinics and out of their hospitals and out of their offices. And I want them to start talking to their friends, to their neighbors, to their -- to their relatives, even the ones who voted for the wrong candidate. I want them to start talking at their churches and their mosques and their synagogues about what's really going on in health care and what a truly great system could look like. Because if we don't do that, we dishonor the suffering that's still going on. We dishonor the people who are being hurt by the system. So the gulf between the system that they've described and the system that we have today is so wide that I think you have to vote for the premise, "The U.S. health care system is terminally broken," but it can and will be fixed.</p></transcript></debate>
