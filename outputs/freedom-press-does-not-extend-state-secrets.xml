And I can see far ahead as well.</p><p end="483" is_meta="false" speaker="Gabriel Schoenfeld" start="423">Ladies and gentlemen, welcome. The gravity of the issue we're debating here tonight cannot be overstated. At stake is nothing less than preventing a reprise of the kinds of attacks that befell our city and our country nearly 10 years ago. To keep our country secure, our government inevitably generates a great many secrets of many different kinds.</p><p end="541" is_meta="false" speaker="Gabriel Schoenfeld" start="483">We cannot disclose all of the methods by which we track terrorists. We cannot publicize the vulnerabilities of our bridges and tunnels and buildings. We have an absolute duty to conceal things like the blueprints for nuclear weapons or the formulas for substances like aerosolized anthrax. But equally at stake is the character of our democracy. We live in an open society, and secrecy is antithetical to the democratic idea. Secrecy can be used as a cover for corruption and wrong-doing. And we depend upon a free press to keep us informed about what our government is doing in our name, including the things that it's doing in secret, or at least some of them. And indeed the foreign affairs pages of our major newspapers are filled with stories based upon reporting drawn from state secrets.</p><p end="541" is_meta="false" speaker="Gabriel Schoenfeld" start="483">And that's the way things are, and that's the way they ought to be.</p><p end="606" is_meta="false" speaker="Gabriel Schoenfeld" start="541">But even as we have a press that we want to be delving into state secrets, it must do so under the rule of law. That is the press must be vulnerable to prosecution when it violates the laws governing secrecy. Now here, as Robert Rosenkranz mentioned, we run head long into the First Amendment. The First Amendment says that Congress shall make nolaw abridging freedom of speech or the press. But, of course, we live with numerous abridgments of free speech and free press, all widely accepted by the public and upheld by the courts. We can't libel one another. We can't engage in false advertising. And of course, it's forbidden to yell, "Fire" -- falsely yell, "Fire" in a crowded theater like this one. Now, Congress has enacted several statutes that criminalize the publication of state secrets. The Espionage Act was mentioned but one might also point to the Atomic Energy Act that makes it a crime to publish classified material pertaining to the design of nuclear weapons.</p><p end="666" is_meta="false" speaker="Gabriel Schoenfeld" start="606">Or the COMINT Act which makes it a crime to publish classified information pertaining to cryptography, or code breaking, or the Intelligence Identities Protection Act makes it a crime to publish the identities of undercover CIA officers and other intelligence officers of the U.S. government. Now, these laws are all in obvious tension with the First Amendment, but no court has ever struck them down. And it is a statement of fact, ladies and gentlemen, the proposition under debate here tonight, the freedom of the press does not extend to state secrets, is inarguably true. Valid laws are on the books that criminalize the publication of certain state secrets. Now, does the existence of such laws mean that every time a journalist like my colleague here, David Sanger, publishes a state secret he should be prosecuted and marched off to prison? Absolutely not. That would be foolish in the extreme. That's why we recognize that our government is promiscuous with the secrecy stamp.</p><p end="719" is_meta="false" speaker="Gabriel Schoenfeld" start="666">It marks lots of things secret that need not be. And back when I was an editor at Commentary Magazine, I myself published classified information and I would do so again. The real question raised by the proposition is whether the press can and should be prosecuted in those instances when it places the country in danger. Such danger is not purely hypothetical. Back in the 1970s there was a magazine called Counterspy that began to publish the identities of hundreds of CIA officers around the world. In 1975, it outed Richard Welch as the CIA Station Chief in Athens. And no sooner was his name disclosed that he was murdered by a Greek terrorist organization as a direct result of that revelation.</p><p end="780" is_meta="false" speaker="Gabriel Schoenfeld" start="719">Today we have WikiLeaks which in the name of transparency has indiscriminately dumped thousands of secret diplomatic and military cables onto the Internet. Now, some of those documents are innocuous. And many of them without question help us better understand what our government is doing around the world and what other governments are doing, but some of them are outright dangerous. One WikiLeaks document, a U.S.</p><p end="780" is_meta="false" speaker="Gabriel Schoenfeld" start="719">Army document that they put on the Internet, describes the technical details of the jamming devices used by our soldiers in Iraq to scramble the signals that insurgents were using to detonate roadside bombs. Now, I ask you is there any reasonable person whobelieves it should be legal to publish the secret countermeasures used by our soldiers to keep from getting blown up on the battlefield?</p><p end="846" is_meta="false" speaker="Gabriel Schoenfeld" start="780">Is there any reasonable person who believes it should be legal to publish blueprints for making nuclear bombs -- or should it be legal to give out the recipe for -- to publish the recipe for making aerosolized anthrax? Those are questions that I hope we will receive straightforward answers to tonight from David Sanger and Alan Dershowitz. If they believe those things should be allowed, I hope they'll fully and frankly acknowledge the costs, and if they think those things should be prohibited by law, well, then they'll be agreeing with the very proposition that they supposedly came here to oppose. Ladies and gentlemen, freedom of the press does not, cannot, and should not extend to state secrets.</p><p end="846" is_meta="false" speaker="Gabriel Schoenfeld" start="780">Not all government secrets warrant protection, but some clearly do. And if you in the audience agree with what Justice Robert Jackson once memorably said, that the Constitution of the United States is not a suicide pact, I urge you to vote for the proposition at issue here tonight.</p><p end="900" is_meta="false" speaker="Gabriel Schoenfeld" start="846">Thank you.</p><p end="900" is_meta="true" speaker="Gabriel Schoenfeld" start="846">applause</p><p end="900" is_meta="false" speaker="Alan Dershowitz" start="846">All I can tell you is "Reversal of Fortune," having been produced by son, Elon Dershowitz, who is in the audience, is a much better film.</p><p end="900" is_meta="true" speaker="Alan Dershowitz" start="846">laughter</p><p end="1382" is_meta="false" speaker="Michael Chertoff" start="1323">You're not going to hear any secrets from me, John.</p><p end="1382" is_meta="false" speaker="Michael Chertoff" start="1323">Thank you, very much.[applause]</p><p end="1382" is_meta="false" speaker="Michael Chertoff" start="1323">First, let me again thank you for inviting us to this debate. I think it's a critical issue for the country.</p><p end="1441" is_meta="false" speaker="Michael Chertoff" start="1382">I'm delighted to be on the same stage with such distinguished scholars and authors. I think, though, if I'm not mistaken, that the other side has essentially conceded the proposition for which we are arguing, and that proposition is that freedom of the press has to give way to state secrets. Now, nobody is arguing that the proposition means everything that the government has in its possession is a state secret, nor are we arguing that simply having a single public official asserting that something is a state secret ends the analysis. But I think where the dispute has come down to is who actually makes the decision. Is it the government and the government process, which is what our contention is and our proposition is, or is it the press. Does the press get the final say? Now, I will agree with Professor Dershowitz that in the first instance, the right way to deal with this problem is for the government to control its own secrets.</p><p end="1502" is_meta="false" speaker="Michael Chertoff" start="1441">And most of the time, the government succeeds in doing so. Although the press is constantly making the argument that as a matter of law, they ought to have access to those secrets. And those arguments are relatively routinely rebuffed. But the reality is that there are times people do leak secrets. And sometimes they do it for what they may conceive to be noble motives. Sometimes they do it for purposes of settling scores or personal advancement. And sometimes they do it perhaps because they want to hurt the United States. And in those instances, it is not enough to say that because the government has failed to keep the secret, the secret ought to become public and ought to be published widely. National security and human life cannot be the subject of a cat and mouse game. And so I would argue that actually the existing system, which does require freedom of the press to give way to genuine state secrets is pretty much the correct balance. How does that work?</p><p end="1560" is_meta="false" speaker="Michael Chertoff" start="1502">Well, first of all, if the press wants to get a secret in the possession of the government, it's very difficult to do so. And there's a very strong presumption against simply open access to very significant classified material. But we do have cases where the material gets out.</p><p end="1560" is_meta="false" speaker="Michael Chertoff" start="1502">And there, I believe the law allows, if the facts are there and the intent is there, a prosecution to take place as a way of deterring somebody from publishing that secret.</p><p end="1560" is_meta="false" speaker="Michael Chertoff" start="1502">And that's in fact what the law basically is. There are statutes in the books that permit those prosecutions. When the courts have been confronted with those prosecutions, and those are relatively rare cases, the courts have upheld the principles of those prosecutions.</p><p end="1560" is_meta="false" speaker="Michael Chertoff" start="1502">Even in the Pentagon papers case, at least five of the justices and probably seven,indicated that there were instances where a prosecution might be appropriate even if not in that particular case.</p><p end="1627" is_meta="false" speaker="Michael Chertoff" start="1560">And even with respect to prior restraint, the issuance of an injunction to prevent publication, most of the justices on the court have acknowledged in the case of a very strong and dangerous release of information, for example, the proverbial publication of information about the movement of a troop ship, it would be appropriate to rejoin the publication of that material. And that's because the courts recognize that in the government process, a combination of executive action, congressional action and judicial action is the best mechanism for balancing between state secrets and freedom of the press. Now, the press often argues we ought to be the judges. And the difficulty is that the press is sometimes a flawed judge of what is in the public interest. First of all, the press is not a monolith. As Professor Dershowitz pointed out, we're not concerned about The New York Times. We're worried about people who blog. But the First Amendment doesn't distinguish between The New York Times and The Wall Street Journal and al Manar, which is the news organ of Hezbollah.</p><p end="1688" is_meta="false" speaker="Michael Chertoff" start="1627">Or extreme blogs on the right or the left. All of those are part of the press. Nor do we want to have the government start to license particular organs as organs that can be trusted and organs that can't be trusted. The fact is if we say that state secrets have to give way to the press when the press gets hold of them, then we mean it has to be any member of the press, a blogger, a Hezbollah journalist, somebody who works for a news organ run by the government of a foreign country. And I don't think any of us believe that would be prudent or safe. Is the press right even when we deal with the venerable institutions that we're so familiar with? Well, the press sometimes also makes mistakes.</p><p end="1688" is_meta="false" speaker="Michael Chertoff" start="1627">Several years ago, there was a publication by The New York Times. I know David Sanger knows about this, of information about a program that allowed the United States government to see what was going on in the financial transactions that were being executed through a program known as Swift.</p><p end="1748" is_meta="false" speaker="Michael Chertoff" start="1688">And this was critical in tracking the flow of money that was used to support terrorist activity. Precisely one of the recommendations that was made by the 9/11 commission against the very strong request of the Bush administration, that material was published.</p><p end="1748" is_meta="false" speaker="Michael Chertoff" start="1688">And the original argument was, well, this is something people need to know about because it's potentially illegal or requires some kind of oversight. But what emerged after a period of time is it was completely legal and that there was nothing wrong about it, and nobody's privacy had been improperly invaded. Everything was done according to an appropriate process. And therefore, the public ombudsman of The New York Times had to write a retraction. He had to write a piece in the Times saying that while he had originally endorsed the publication of the Swift material, he had changed his mind, and itwas not appropriate because it turned out that there was nothing wrong with it, and there was no powerful interest served in releasing that material.</p><p end="1803" is_meta="false" speaker="Michael Chertoff" start="1748">And then he made an interesting and telling confession, that he had originally endorsed the disclosure because he didn't like the administration and the way the administration was treating the paper. And I suggest to you that that's the problem with having the press make the decision. The press is no more in a position to separate itself from its interests than anybody else. But unlike the organs of government which are accountable to the public and to each other, the press is accountable to nobody. And that's why I strongly urge you to support the proposition that we're advocating tonight. Thank you very much.</p><p end="1803" is_meta="true" speaker="Michael Chertoff" start="1748">applause</p><p end="1860" is_meta="false" speaker="David Sanger" start="1803">A few.</p><p end="1860" is_meta="false" speaker="David Sanger" start="1803">Thank you</p><p end="1860" is_meta="true" speaker="David Sanger" start="1803">applause</p><p end="1860" is_meta="false" speaker="David Sanger" start="1803">Thank you very much. And it's wonderful to be here and to be with such a great panel.</p><p end="1860" is_meta="false" speaker="David Sanger" start="1803">In Schoenfeld's book, if you haven't read it, it's a wonderful accounting -- historical accounting of the tension between the press and the government. Michael Chertoff has done a fabulous work and we have talked over many years on many different subjects,</p><p end="1860" is_meta="false" speaker="David Sanger" start="1803">and I agree with almost everything that my partner here had to say except when Alan Dershowitz declared that you shouldn't necessarily trust everything that you read in The New York Times.</p><p end="1860" is_meta="true" speaker="David Sanger" start="1803">laughter</p><p end="1860" is_meta="false" speaker="David Sanger" start="1803">We&#8217;ll take that aside later on. I come to this as a practitioner, not as a legal expert.</p><p end="1917" is_meta="false" speaker="David Sanger" start="1860">And I come to this knowing that the tensions that we are discussing here today are as you've heard as old as the Republic. The New York Times among other newspapers had reporters embedded with Civil War troops, Union troops, and at one appropriate moment or another, several generals having read the reviews of their strategy, took those reporters and put them in the brig. I've been around more than a few government officials who have suggested to me over the years as we have debated various stories that we were getting ready to write that what was good for General Sheridan would be perfectly good today. I would argue that in fact it is impossible, it is impossible to separate out state secrets from what appears every day in The New York Times and other major newspapers around the world.</p><p end="1981" is_meta="false" speaker="David Sanger" start="1917">It is impossible because you cannot discuss the subject of whether or not we should have gone into Iraq, or how quickly we should get out of Afghanistan, or the issues surrounding cyber war that we deal with each and every day now, without daily venturing into territory that is classified somewhere and somehow. The problem is, as a reporter, I probably don't even know when much of that material is classified. And I can tell you as someone who went through the WikiLeaks material for many months before The Times and other newspapers published them that I was pretty surprised by some things that were stamped &#8220;secret.&#8221; I came into the office one day and asked if anybody knew why every American embassy that collects the morning news accounts that would appear in the Spanish press or the Chinese press and collates them and sends them off to Washington so that they would have a sense of what's appearing in those press reports each day.</p><p end="2040" is_meta="false" speaker="David Sanger" start="1981">Somebody on the way out the door, as they are putting that cable over to Washington,</p><p end="2040" is_meta="false" speaker="David Sanger" start="1981">stamps &#8220;secret&#8221; on them. They had appeared in the newspaper that morning. What does that tell you early on? It tells you that you cannot have a system in which you keep state secrets from being published if almost everything is a state secret. And my friend,</p><p end="2040" is_meta="false" speaker="David Sanger" start="1981">Michael Chertoff, points out that the press is a flawed judge of the national interest. That is absolutely true, but a better judge than the U.S. government because when you read the U.S. government's own regulations for what gets made classified, what that stamp goes on, the rules only discuss national security considerations. There is no category that makes the person who's got that stamp in the hand weigh a public interest.</p><p end="2100" is_meta="false" speaker="David Sanger" start="2040">Only the press can do that and only after the information is out. Now, there's a second issue around this which the other side pointed out, which is that only the executive, they said, really has the full knowledge to make those decisions. But in fact I think what you heard in the discussion of the constitutional origins of all of this is that the foundersbelieved that to give the executive complete discretion in this area is to create a country that isn't like the America that we know. You would get Egypt under Mubarak; you would get the Chinese press today. And Americans feel that deeply. Just think about the criticism directed at The New York Times when we failed to go as deeply as we should have into the evidence concerning the justification for going into Iraq.</p><p end="2161" is_meta="false" speaker="David Sanger" start="2100">It would have been wonderful if we could have published more about what the U.S.</p><p end="2161" is_meta="false" speaker="David Sanger" start="2100">government knew about whether weapons of mass destruction existed. Eventually, we were able to. But at the time we were doing that reporting, it was all deeply classified,</p><p end="2161" is_meta="false" speaker="David Sanger" start="2100">except for those tidbits that the U.S. government decided to release to support its own case. Now, we are hardly indifferent, as reporters, to the question of what the consequences of these actions are. We live in New York and Washington. Our kids ride the subways. We have reporters who are out all across the world. Many have been kidnapped. A couple, unfortunately, have been killed. A wonderful photographer for The New York Times lost both his legs just a few months ago, stepping on an improvised land mine in Afghanistan. We know that the violent jihadists, who we write about each and every day, have no interest in a free press. And we're not here to side with them.</p><p end="2220" is_meta="false" speaker="David Sanger" start="2161">We are also not here to be propagandists for the U.S. government. And you don't want us to be. If you think, briefly, about some of the stories that we have held back on, we held back for a year on the story on warrantless wiretaps that President Bush authorized.</p><p end="2220" is_meta="false" speaker="David Sanger" start="2161">Eventually, we published it. Congress decided to rewrite the law. We held back for three years -- on a story I worked on for some time -- about a secret U.S. government program to help secure Pakistan's nuclear weapons. We held the story because the government was fearful that if we published it too soon, we would be giving al-Qaeda or the Taliban directions into how to get to those weapons. And we published stories that are quite controversial including one earlier this year about Stuxnet, the computer virus that many believe the U.S. government had a role in developing. It was used against the Iranian nuclear program.</p><p end="2277" is_meta="false" speaker="David Sanger" start="2220">What possibly could be the interest in that? Very simple. If the U.S. government -- if any other government -- is starting off a cyber war, well, we are the country that is most vulnerable to that problem. And we could be subject to attacks in response. So, these are central policy issues. These secrets are not merely published because they are cool stories. They are published because there is a debate that the public has to conduct.</p><p end="2277" is_meta="false" speaker="David Sanger" start="2220">Thank you.</p><p end="2404" is_meta="false" speaker="Michael Chertoff" start="2344">First of all, I respect David, and I certainly don't want to suggest he should ever put himself in harm&#8217;s way. But I think the answer to that is yes. Most of the issues which David has talked about can be written about without getting into matters that are state secrets.</p><p end="2461" is_meta="false" speaker="Michael Chertoff" start="2404">First of all, there are times that information is declassified or becomes available from other sources and doesn't need to be entered into in great detail. But to give you an example of something that I would argue you shouldn't be able to do, is in the run-up to the bin Laden raid that resulted in eliminating bin Laden, obviously, it was a compelling public story. And the fact that we were going to be invading another sovereign country and taking military and fatal action against an individual who had not been tried or convicted was a big issue. I think it was a good idea, but others might have disagreed.</p><p end="2461" is_meta="false" speaker="Michael Chertoff" start="2404">And yet had that been leaked in advance, had it gotten into the hands of the press, I would argued it would be quite appropriate for the government to say to David Sanger, &#8220;If you publish that, we will prosecute you, and perhaps we will even enjoin you from publishing it.&#8221;</p><p end="2461" is_meta="false" speaker="Michael Chertoff" start="2404">Absolutely.</p><p end="2525" is_meta="false" speaker="David Sanger" start="2461">Well, certainly the bin Laden raid raises a very good question and is one in which The New York Times has been very clear throughout the time that we went through the WikiLeaks material. Long before that, we have said, as you can see from the examples I cited earlier, that we do not publish stories about operations. We don't name dissidents who walked into the Chinese embassy and talked to American diplomats. Where do we draw the line? Information that is merely embarrassing as opposed to operational. So the U.S. government, during the midst of the WikiLeaks operation, asked us to withhold the information that the king of Saudi Arabia said in response to a discussion with an American diplomat about Iran's nuclear program, "Cut off the head of the snake." Now,</p><p end="2525" is_meta="false" speaker="David Sanger" start="2461">why did they consider this to be particularly sensitive? No one was going to go put theking of Saudi Arabia in jail the way a Chinese or Saudi dissident might be put in jail for saying the wrong thing.</p><p end="2582" is_meta="false" speaker="David Sanger" start="2525">They considered it sensitive because it would make it more difficult to conduct American foreign policy if the king read his own words in The New York Times or foreign publications. And so that's the distinction that I think is critical, the one between an operational secret and embarrassment. And there is no place in the law that makes that distinction.</p><p end="2582" is_meta="false" speaker="Gabriel Schoenfeld" start="2525">Well, I find that curious. Operational secrets -- what is the Swift program? But an operational program to monitor the finances of al-Qaeda that the Times published against the strong protest not only of the Bush administration but leading Democrats like Lee Hamilton of the 9/11 Commission. And the Times justification for it was always quite murky. Eric Lichtblau, the reporter, one of the two reporters who wrote the story, said in his memoir about it, "It was, above all else, an interesting yarn." What was the public interest that was served there?</p><p end="2642" is_meta="false" speaker="Gabriel Schoenfeld" start="2582">The Times -- the ombudsman of the Times, as Secretary Chertoff pointed out, disavowed the story. So did the general counsel of the Times. So I don't think that in the final analysis we can just have a system where editors make the -- make such decisions without being subject, vulnerable to prosecution, not necessarily prosecuted, for instance,</p><p end="2642" is_meta="false" speaker="Gabriel Schoenfeld" start="2582">but vulnerable to prosecution.</p><p end="2642" is_meta="false" speaker="Alan Dershowitz" start="2582">Well, I can tell you that the greatest forms of censorship that take place today are not censorship imposed by the government. It's self-censorship resulting from fear of prosecution. I see that all the time, or fear of libel, other kinds of defamation lawsuits.</p><p end="2642" is_meta="false" speaker="Alan Dershowitz" start="2582">So clearly it has an impact. But I'm not one who thinks that free speech is free or that it comes without costs.</p><p end="2704" is_meta="false" speaker="Alan Dershowitz" start="2642">In fact, I think we've heard a very clever debaters' point here tonight from our opponents,</p><p end="2704" is_meta="false" speaker="Alan Dershowitz" start="2642">namely that if we concede that there are any conceivable state secrets like the plan to kill Osama bin Laden, then we can see the proposition. That's absolutely not the case. The proposition is state secrets. And I submit that you've conceded our point by changing the debate from state secrets to -- and I quote Judge Chertoff -- to "Genuine state secrets."</p><p end="2704" is_meta="false" speaker="Alan Dershowitz" start="2642">And you also used a modifier, "Real state secrets." The problem is it's just too broad.</p><p end="2704" is_meta="false" speaker="Alan Dershowitz" start="2642">Now, there are going to be problems. And The New York Times is not the only game in town. Judge, you mentioned, how about the Hezbollah press? They might publish it. Do you think American law is going to stop the Hezbollah press from publishing anything?</p><p end="2704" is_meta="false" speaker="Alan Dershowitz" start="2642">So that's just a red herring.</p><p end="2704" is_meta="false" speaker="Michael Chertoff" start="2642">But, see, I think this is the point. The point is -- and I don't think we have to argue that simply calling something a state secret ends the analysis. What's important is whether it's in The New York Times or Hezbollah press or somebody else.</p><p end="2766" is_meta="false" speaker="Michael Chertoff" start="2704">If they are in an area where they are dealing with material that is classified and sensitive,</p><p end="2766" is_meta="false" speaker="Michael Chertoff" start="2704">they have to make a judgment. Now, there's a certain amount of uncertainty. And I understand that may have a chilling effect. But that chilling effect is what imposes a sense of responsibility. And let me say, everybody in the world who exercises power and authority, lives with the possibility that if they guess wrong, they're going to wind up in trouble, including, for example, CIA agents who find themselves being investigated, and yet nobody says they should be immune from the possibility of investigation.</p><p end="2823" is_meta="false" speaker="Alan Dershowitz" start="2766">Let me just make one quick point.</p><p end="2823" is_meta="false" speaker="David Sanger" start="2766">Can I do the job? Yes. Can I do the job the way all of you want me to do the job?</p><p end="2823" is_meta="false" speaker="David Sanger" start="2766">Probably not.</p><p end="2888" is_meta="false" speaker="David Sanger" start="2823">And that's because, as you said, there is uncertainty in the system. There's always going to be uncertainty in this system. But the uncertainty can't extend to the point where we are stopping from publishing something that may be published, as Alan points out,</p><p end="2888" is_meta="false" speaker="David Sanger" start="2823">outside the country. It may be available in another form, maybe at a U.N. agency, maybe among international nuclear inspectors, and also was classified in the United States. And we simply will not know. We cannot know what is classified. You have to assume that almost anything on a sensitive subject like this is classified in some way. And so we have to roll that dice every single day. And we're willing to take that risk not for us, but because there is a broader readership and citizenship out there --</p><p end="2888" is_meta="false" speaker="David Sanger" start="2823">That's not true.</p><p end="2888" is_meta="false" speaker="David Sanger" start="2823">That's not true.</p><p end="2946" is_meta="false" speaker="Michael Chertoff" start="2888">I think that illustrates my point, which is, in fact, the proposition is correct. Freedom of the press does give way before state secrets. And the reason that we can accept that proposition is because we have built a structure that actually is quite protective even within the terms of that proposition. The reason that there haven't been prosecutions of journalists is because people weigh what will happen in a courtroom with a judge and a jury. And so when you do your job in a close case, if you feel you're acting in good faith,</p><p end="2946" is_meta="false" speaker="Michael Chertoff" start="2888">you can have a reasonably high degree of confidence that if it doesn't wind up in a prosecution, you can go to court, and you're going to wind up prevailing in front of a judge and a jury.</p><p end="3006" is_meta="false" speaker="Alan Dershowitz" start="2946">And that's the worst possible result because what it says --</p><p end="3006" is_meta="false" speaker="Alan Dershowitz" start="2946">-- is if The New York Times, if you're Seymour Hersh, if you're Bob Woodward, you have nothing to worry about. But if you're Julian Assange, and you're not working under the supervision of the government, if you're not somebody who has a constant relationship with the government, you have plenty to worry about. It gives the government far too much discretion to go after people who reveal information that is not something they want revealed. And I think, frankly, you're asking the wrong question.</p><p end="3006" is_meta="false" speaker="Alan Dershowitz" start="2946">Can he do the job? That's a terrible criteria under the First Amendment. We can change it and say, could we have literature without there being sex? Of course we can. We can have Shakespeare. But that's never been the criteria under the First Amendment. Can you do your job? That shifts the presumption and the burden to the press to justify that it can do its job. The answer is, is there a constraint, a lawful and -- constraint on the way the press does its job, and I think the answer to that is there's far too much discretion inthe government to decide who to go after for leaking and who not to, and that's very dangerous.</p><p end="3058" is_meta="false" speaker="Michael Chertoff" start="3006">And actually I think Alan --</p><p end="3058" is_meta="false" speaker="Gabriel Schoenfeld" start="3006">It may be dangerous for leakers but it certainly -- the historical record is not one of danger for the press. There's never been a successful prosecution of journalists as David Sanger just noted. And the one case, I'm wondering what you think about it, that where there was -- a prosecution was initiated, The Chicago Tribune case in World War II where the government -- where The Chicago Tribune published a front page story strongly suggesting that we had broken the Japanese naval codes, a leak that could have cost the lives of tens of thousands of U.S. servicemen. Now, there are plenty of people,</p><p end="3058" is_meta="false" speaker="Gabriel Schoenfeld" start="3006">journalists who think that there shouldn't -- that there shouldn't have been a prosecution,</p><p end="3058" is_meta="false" speaker="Gabriel Schoenfeld" start="3006">but, I mean, that seems to me almost madness.</p><p end="3058" is_meta="false" speaker="Alan Dershowitz" start="3006">Well, first of all there have been many, many prosecutions not under that particular statute but you've heard about shouting "fire" in the crowded theater. Do you know what the facts were of that case?</p><p end="3121" is_meta="false" speaker="Alan Dershowitz" start="3058">There was a guy who was handing out leaflets in front of a draft board, telling people to consider whether or not they might have a constitutional right to be a conscientious objector. And Oliver Wendell Holmes, in the worst analogy ever constructed by the legal mind --</p><p end="3121" is_meta="true" speaker="Alan Dershowitz" start="3058">laughter</p><p end="3121" is_meta="false" speaker="Alan Dershowitz" start="3058">-- turned that into shouting fire in a crowded theater. The analogy was handing out a leaflet outside of a burning theater, saying, &#8220;Please don't go in there, it might be unsafe to you,&#8221; and he turns out to be wrong.</p><p end="3121" is_meta="true" speaker="Alan Dershowitz" start="3058">talking simultaneously</p><p end="3121" is_meta="false" speaker="David Sanger" start="3058">Well, you know --</p><p end="3121" is_meta="false" speaker="David Sanger" start="3058">Let&#8217;s take Gabe&#8217;s question right on because these are decisions we have to make every day. During the run up to the Iraq War, the Bush administration said repeatedly that they had made no decision and had no plans to invade Iraq.</p><p end="3183" is_meta="false" speaker="David Sanger" start="3121">The New York Times discovered over the July 4th holiday in 2002 that there was a very detailed plan to invade Iraq. And it published that fact with just enough detail to make it clear that in fact the Bush administration had put together a plan, but not quite enough detail to actually tell Saddam Hussein what that plan looked like. Now, there were many in the Bush administration at that time who were calling for the prosecution of The New York Times. I think The New York Times served an enormously important public interest there by making it clear to the public that no matter what government officials were saying in public to them, in fact they had a plan based on what we now know was fairly loose evidence, to invade a foreign country.</p><p end="3183" is_meta="false" speaker="Michael Chertoff" start="3121">But isn&#8217;t --</p><p end="3183" is_meta="false" speaker="Michael Chertoff" start="3121">But doesn't that actually illustrate the point we've been making, that the restrictions in place do allow a judgment to be made about whether something will cross the line or not because --</p><p end="3240" is_meta="false" speaker="Alan Dershowitz" start="3183">I think there's an answer to that.</p><p end="3302" is_meta="false" speaker="Alan Dershowitz" start="3240">If a newspaper learned about the fact that the SEALs were preparing to attack bin Laden,</p><p end="3302" is_meta="false" speaker="Alan Dershowitz" start="3240">then that attack should have been aborted. You haven't been keeping your secrets well enough. You can't depend on a newspaper's discretion to put the lives of brave American SEALs at risk. So if you find out that a newspaper has that report, you have to abort.</p><p end="3302" is_meta="false" speaker="Alan Dershowitz" start="3240">Sometimes [unintelligible] --</p><p end="3302" is_meta="false" speaker="Alan Dershowitz" start="3240">Well, let me give you a story. Jimmy Reston didn't print the story of the Bay of Pigs invasion because he wanted to protect Americans and Cubans. The Bay of Pigs Invasion was a disaster for America and a disaster for Cuban patriots.</p><p end="3302" is_meta="false" speaker="Gabriel Schoenfeld" start="3240">By that logic --</p><p end="3302" is_meta="true" speaker="Gabriel Schoenfeld" start="3240">talking simultaneously</p><p end="3302" is_meta="false" speaker="Gabriel Schoenfeld" start="3240">And by that logic, Professor Dershowitz, The Times should have published, if it had known in advance, that we were about to make the raid on bin Laden.</p><p end="3302" is_meta="false" speaker="Gabriel Schoenfeld" start="3240">Because it could have gotten wrong. And then we would have to abort the operation?</p><p end="3362" is_meta="false" speaker="Alan Dershowitz" start="3302">If in fact The Times learned that it was a bad plan and that it was an illegal plan, and they decided to publish it, and we had to abort it, that would be a very, very good example of the interplay between --</p><p end="3362" is_meta="false" speaker="Michael Chertoff" start="3302">No, it would be --</p><p end="3362" is_meta="false" speaker="Alan Dershowitz" start="3302">-- the press and the executive.</p><p end="3362" is_meta="false" speaker="Michael Chertoff" start="3302">-- an example --</p><p end="3362" is_meta="false" speaker="Alan Dershowitz" start="3302">I don't think --</p><p end="3362" is_meta="false" speaker="Alan Dershowitz" start="3302">Not for the ideas, only for the words.</p><p end="3423" is_meta="false" speaker="Michael Chertoff" start="3362">Right. Exactly.</p><p end="3423" is_meta="false" speaker="Alan Dershowitz" start="3362">Okay. That's different.</p><p end="3423" is_meta="false" speaker="Michael Chertoff" start="3362">Does that -- and that happens from time to time -- does that cause The Times to enter into a state of paralytic hysteria?</p><p end="3423" is_meta="false" speaker="Alan Dershowitz" start="3362">I think you're missing -- briefly, I think you're missing my point.</p><p end="3423" is_meta="false" speaker="Michael Chertoff" start="3362">They live with that threat of being [inaudible] --</p><p end="3423" is_meta="true" speaker="Michael Chertoff" start="3362">talking simultaneously</p><p end="3423" is_meta="false" speaker="Alan Dershowitz" start="3362">My point about -- about the Osama bin Laden is that The Times had learned about it.</p><p end="3423" is_meta="false" speaker="Alan Dershowitz" start="3362">That would mean there is a real possibility that others would know about it. And that's an important decision for the government to know about.</p><p end="3423" is_meta="false" speaker="Alan Dershowitz" start="3362">Right. Well, no. It's -- you know, the risk -- the government shouldn't let The New York Times find out about secrets like that.</p><p end="3423" is_meta="false" speaker="Alan Dershowitz" start="3362">Male Speaker:We have [inaudible] --</p><p end="3423" is_meta="false" speaker="Gabriel Schoenfeld" start="3362">Let's talk about how this would actually have played out.</p><p end="3423" is_meta="true" speaker="Gabriel Schoenfeld" start="3362">talking simultaneously</p><p end="3423" is_meta="false" speaker="Gabriel Schoenfeld" start="3362">Hundreds of people are involved in a military operation like that.</p><p end="3423" is_meta="false" speaker="Gabriel Schoenfeld" start="3362">Thousands of people are involved --</p><p end="3423" is_meta="false" speaker="Gabriel Schoenfeld" start="3362">-- in other secrets. 2.5 million Americans hold security clearances. Eight hundred thousand of them --</p><p end="3423" is_meta="false" speaker="Alan Dershowitz" start="3362">That's the problem.</p><p end="3423" is_meta="false" speaker="Gabriel Schoenfeld" start="3362">-- hold top secret clearances. With populations of that size, you're going to have people who disagree with the government, people who might be deranged, people who are going to leak secrets. We cannot --</p><p end="3423" is_meta="false" speaker="Alan Dershowitz" start="3362">How many people do you think knew about the Osama bin Laden raid?</p><p end="3479" is_meta="false" speaker="David Sanger" start="3423">Dozens -- maybe hundreds knew about it. It didn't leak, and I'm very glad that it didn't.</p><p end="3479" is_meta="false" speaker="David Sanger" start="3423">And The New York Times didn't have to make that decision.</p><p end="3479" is_meta="false" speaker="David Sanger" start="3423">How would this have played out in real life? I suspect with The New York Times, for all the reasons I've laid out before, would not have published that fact. But when the phone call was made to the White House to say, &#8220;We have heard this,&#8221; my guess is that what would have played out is exactly what Alan suggested. The operation probably would have been aborted, just for the fact that we made that phone call. And that tells you a little bit about how the system works in reality.</p><p end="3479" is_meta="false" speaker="Michael Chertoff" start="3423">Well, you're surely not going to argue, David, that the purpose of giving the press immunity is to allow them to play a kind of red teaming on government operations.</p><p end="3479" is_meta="false" speaker="David Sanger" start="3423">Certainly not.</p><p end="3479" is_meta="false" speaker="Michael Chertoff" start="3423">Because for example, with Swift, Swift was working perfectly well until we [inaudible] --</p><p end="3541" is_meta="false" speaker="Michael Chertoff" start="3479">Swift was the program that allowed the U.S. government to track the flow of money to terrorists on a global basis, which was exactly what the 9/11 Commission recommended.</p><p end="3541" is_meta="false" speaker="Michael Chertoff" start="3479">And it was a very useful and important program. And it wasn't failing. And the revelation of the program ultimately led to it becoming much less effective.</p><p end="3541" is_meta="false" speaker="Michael Chertoff" start="3479">And no issues of illegalities, The Times itself conceded. So there was a minimal public interest. This wasn't exposing criminality. What about the plans for weaponizing anthrax or for coming up with biological weapons? Would you take the argument that if we publicize those plans, that shows that the information is out there, therefore let'sdisseminate it widely so people can begin to cook up bacterial anthrax in their garage? I think the logic in this refutes itself.</p><p end="3605" is_meta="false" speaker="David Sanger" start="3541">As a reporter, I would hope -- I would hope the prosecution wouldn't happen.</p><p end="3663" is_meta="false" speaker="David Sanger" start="3605">But the reality is that you have to establish a system in which the secrets that America is protecting are real secrets, like the bin Laden example that we were using before. But instead, we live in a system in which there are millions of pages classified each and every day. And you can't have a press that is living forever in the fear that the publication of any piece of data could lead to an equivalent prosecutorial discretion on this issue. And so if you're going to truly not devalue the point of the realm, if you're going to say there are some things that the United States really needs to protect, it's got to be a very, verynarrow list. And that is not where the U.S. government is going. In fact, the amount of classified data expands dramatically every single year.</p><p end="3724" is_meta="false" speaker="Michael Chertoff" start="3663">Well, I think the answer to the question then was, essentially as the question you're asked,</p><p end="3724" is_meta="false" speaker="Michael Chertoff" start="3663">you can see that there obviously are occasions when the press should be prosecuted for publication.</p><p end="3724" is_meta="false" speaker="Alan Dershowitz" start="3663">For publication of --</p><p end="3724" is_meta="false" speaker="Michael Chertoff" start="3663">Of state secrets. And the issue then becomes --</p><p end="3724" is_meta="false" speaker="Alan Dershowitz" start="3663">Or some state secrets.</p><p end="3724" is_meta="false" speaker="Michael Chertoff" start="3663">And the argument that David makes is, but the problem is it's too hard because there's too much classified material. And yet the facts show that when it comes time to make the decision to prosecute, government historically, whether it be Republicans or Democrats,</p><p end="3724" is_meta="false" speaker="Michael Chertoff" start="3663">have been very, very conservative and cautious in actually prosecuting. And that tells me the system works, that in fact the government doesn't overreach on prosecution and that it is possible to have a workable system where people who are responsible journalists know where they can't go, like the bin Laden case, and the irresponsible ones, dare I say Assange, may find themselves in a different --</p><p end="3724" is_meta="false" speaker="Alan Dershowitz" start="3663">And who decides who's responsible and irresponsible on the basis of what criteria?</p><p end="3783" is_meta="false" speaker="Alan Dershowitz" start="3724">The issue is whether or not somebody should be punished for publishing state secrets.</p><p end="3783" is_meta="false" speaker="Alan Dershowitz" start="3724">The answer to that is clearly no, not for publishing state secrets. If you want to have a list of things that can be published, that's a very different criteria. You yourself conceded all three branches of government have to be involved. At the moment, the legislative branch hasn't been involved. They have punted. They have simply said, broadly defined state secrets, the Espionage Act. That has to be scrapped. And if you want to have six, nine,</p><p end="3783" is_meta="false" speaker="Alan Dershowitz" start="3724">four specific categories of things that can't be published, that's an interesting debate, and I think both of us would acknowledge. But not to punish people for violating state secrets -</p><p end="3783" is_meta="false" speaker="Alan Dershowitz" start="3724">-- that sounds like other countries which have --</p><p end="3783" is_meta="false" speaker="Gabriel Schoenfeld" start="3724">The legislature -- the legislature has not punted. We do have highly specific laws on the books. The direct question was put to you, Mr. Sanger, would you prosecute -- should the press be prosecuted when it violates those sanctions, when it violates those particular statutes?</p><p end="3847" is_meta="false" speaker="Gabriel Schoenfeld" start="3783">If the press publishes, for example, the identities of an intelligence agent, CIA agent, do you believe that the press should be prosecuted? If the press publishes designs of nuclear weapons, as the Progressives tried to do in 1979, is there a basis for prosecution?</p><p end="3847" is_meta="false" speaker="David Sanger" start="3783">There may well be a basis for prosecution. But the judgment for doing that runs a much greater risk, which is the chilling effect risk. And there are certainly a very limited number of things for which I could imagine why the U.S. government would get in and truly seek to prosecute. The fact that they haven't tells you that they seem to know already that this is an unsustainable legal regime for the very reasons that Alan has laid out, that there is nothing in the law that distinguishes between that very narrow group of true state secrets which we can all put a list together and probably the list you could count on both hands.</p><p end="3899" is_meta="false" speaker="David Sanger" start="3847">And that vast majority of material that is covered under those very laws you described.</p><p end="3899" is_meta="false" speaker="Alan Dershowitz" start="3847">Can I ask a question of you? Would you be prepared to abolish the Espionage Act of 1917 with its broad characterizations and just limit prosecution to those particular statutes that you talked about, naming spies, naming intelligence? Then we have an interesting debate. The problem is the current statutory criterias, the worst of all possible worlds, it gives enormous discretion, and it gives the very government whose secrets are being released, the discretion and the power to decide not to go after The New York Times,</p><p end="3899" is_meta="false" speaker="Alan Dershowitz" start="3847">they like them --</p><p end="3899" is_meta="false" speaker="Alan Dershowitz" start="3847">John Donvan:Michael Chertoff, do you want to answer the question?</p><p end="3899" is_meta="false" speaker="Michael Chertoff" start="3847">Again, I mean, I hate to say it. I think that gives the whole game away. So if we agreed that the Identities Protection Act, if we agree the Communications and Cryptographic Act which are very specific --</p><p end="3899" is_meta="false" speaker="Alan Dershowitz" start="3847">Right.</p><p end="3899" is_meta="false" speaker="Michael Chertoff" start="3847">-- that those appropriate, that prosecutions are appropriate.</p><p end="3962" is_meta="false" speaker="Michael Chertoff" start="3899">Then I think you've conceded that in fact state secrets ought to be sufficient to make the -</p><p end="3962" is_meta="false" speaker="Michael Chertoff" start="3899">-</p><p end="3962" is_meta="true" speaker="Michael Chertoff" start="3899">talking simultaneously</p><p end="3962" is_meta="false" speaker="Michael Chertoff" start="3899">No. I think what the for side is saying is that the statement is correct in the context of the government system in which we operate. That's why saying, well, you know, this is --</p><p end="3962" is_meta="false" speaker="Michael Chertoff" start="3899">we don't want to become like Egypt or Russia, that's not the context in which the proposition is offered. The proposition is offered in the context of our current system of government in which part of the protection for the press is not just, quote, "Freedom of the press in the First Amendment." But it is the structure of government that says if you actually want to take the step of prosecution, you've got to have an executive decision to prosecute.</p><p end="4020" is_meta="false" speaker="Michael Chertoff" start="3962">You've got to judge who will consider Alan Dershowitz's arguments about whether the law is properly written, and you'll have a jury of 12 people like you who will make the final decision. And in that context the proposition, I think, makes the unassailable pointthat freedom of the press has to be balanced against and in some instances give way to state secrets.</p><p end="4020" is_meta="false" speaker="Alan Dershowitz" start="3962">And the worst possible solution is to give --</p><p end="4020" is_meta="false" speaker="Alan Dershowitz" start="3962">-- the very same government that is being offended the power to make that decision. And if you think you can count on juries, just remember how juries operated during the McCarthy period. Remember how juries operate during times of crisis. The First Amendment was built to protect the most unpopular, the most hated during the worst periods of our history. And discretion is not going to serve that protection.</p><p end="4020" is_meta="false" speaker="Alan Dershowitz" start="3962">-- solid laws. We need -- let me give you the --</p><p end="4020" is_meta="false" speaker="Gabriel Schoenfeld" start="3962">I have the microphone. I have the microphone.</p><p end="4084" is_meta="false" speaker="Gabriel Schoenfeld" start="4020">Even if we take your suggestion, and scrap the Espionage Act, which I would have trouble trusting the current Congress to do a better job than the one that wrote it in 1917--</p><p end="4084" is_meta="true" speaker="Gabriel Schoenfeld" start="4020">applause</p><p end="4084" is_meta="false" speaker="Alan Dershowitz" start="4020">They couldn't do a worse job.</p><p end="4084" is_meta="false" speaker="Gabriel Schoenfeld" start="4020">But even if we did that, and we had a new set of laws that somehow managed to enumerate the very complex set of things that have to be protected. It's not just a little listof six, by the way. You still -- if you had new laws, you'd still have juries, and you'd still have prosecutors using their discretion. That's built into our system. It's not a perfect system. Name a better one.</p><p end="4084" is_meta="false" speaker="Alan Dershowitz" start="4020">Let me tell you. Let me name a better one. We should have a rule that says you cannot,</p><p end="4084" is_meta="false" speaker="Alan Dershowitz" start="4020">under any circumstances, publish the name of spies. And if The New York Times does it, they must be prosecuted. If WikiLeaks does it, they must be prosecuted. No room for discretion.</p><p end="4084" is_meta="false" speaker="Alan Dershowitz" start="4020">No prosecutorial discretion, period.</p><p end="4084" is_meta="false" speaker="David Sanger" start="4020">I'm sorry?</p><p end="4084" is_meta="false" speaker="David Sanger" start="4020">I wouldn&#8217;t be happy with specific rules because I know that as situations evolve, you're going to discover that that list is going to leave both sides unsatisfied.</p><p end="4144" is_meta="false" speaker="David Sanger" start="4084">That's why we're dealing with an Espionage Act that was written in 1917 that we don't think fits the modern world. But it would certainly be better to have a very narrow list like that than what we are living with today. Because what we're living with today would allow the government of the United States under extreme circumstances, and I'm not saying it would happen in the current political environment, but you've got to think when you do this about a political environment into the future, in which they could prosecute for almost anything that you read in the national security coverage pages of The New York Times in each and every day. And when the law is written that broadly, it simply becomes devalued over time.</p><p end="4144" is_meta="false" speaker="Gabriel Schoenfeld" start="4084">It's a very high hurdle. It's a very high hurdle prosecuting a journalist under the Espionage Act.</p><p end="4198" is_meta="false" speaker="Gabriel Schoenfeld" start="4144">And they have to show bad faith on the part of the journalist, intent to injure the United States.</p><p end="4198" is_meta="false" speaker="Gabriel Schoenfeld" start="4144">That's -- wait. Let me, let me finish. But I want to just return back to this question of the raid on Osama bin Laden. Which you say the Times would not have printed if it had known in advance, would not have wanted to jeopardize that example that the American forces. But just a few minutes before that, you were saying you were applauding the fact that the Times should have published in advance the Bay of Pigs operation. Which is it?</p><p end="4198" is_meta="false" speaker="David Sanger" start="4144">It's a very --</p><p end="4198" is_meta="true" speaker="David Sanger" start="4144">applause</p><p end="4198" is_meta="false" speaker="David Sanger" start="4144">-- a very basic answer to that question. The Times did not publish the Bay of Pigs operation. And what happened was the president of the United States turned around later on and said, &#8220;Gee, I wish you would have.&#8221; The Times has not published many other operational cases like that. Is that always a good judgment? Not necessarily. The --</p><p end="4260" is_meta="false" speaker="David Sanger" start="4198">The problem that we're dealing with here is that mistakes are going to be made on both sides, and the question is where do we want the law to weigh the errors? And the answer to my mind is we want to err on the side of disclosure. That's what the First Amendment is all about.</p><p end="4260" is_meta="true" speaker="David Sanger" start="4198">talking simultaneously</p><p end="4322" is_meta="false" speaker="Michael Chertoff" start="4260">And I think that illustrates exactly why I think the current system works not perfectly but as well as you can have in human existence. The current system as you point out in the question recognizes that there's never an absolute. There are probably some times that you could reveal the identity of an agent when it's out there already, and you could argue that there's really no impact. There are other times when you're reviewing other kinds of information that would be terribly devastating or damaging, again, recipes for certain kinds of weapons or for the revelation of certain kinds of operational plans. And the key is in all of these situations what we do is we have a system for resolving a prosecution because we involve people like sitting in this room and 12 jurors in the box, and that is the protection that we have that in the end the law will be applied reasonably and a reasonable application of the law is the best defense.</p><p end="4381" is_meta="false" speaker="Michael Chertoff" start="4322">A rigid application is one which is likely to wind up with exactly the kind of conundrum [inaudible]--</p><p end="4381" is_meta="false" speaker="Alan Dershowitz" start="4322">-- rigid application when it comes to the First Amendment. The First Amendment says,</p><p end="4381" is_meta="false" speaker="Alan Dershowitz" start="4322">no, juries don't get to decide that because juries and the people like to ban things when they&#8217;re very, very unpopular. The Constitution prohibits that, just like the Constitution prohibits discrimination against the most absurd of all religions. And we can't have that kind of discretion. The rule has to be items can't be published, the names, that might be too broad or too narrow, if The Times publishes it, they can be prosecuted. If the White House publishes it, they can be prosecuted. And if WikiLeaks publishes it, they can be prosecuted. The same law has to apply to all. You're saying nobody is in danger because there is no prosecution. There is currently in Virginia a grand jury investigation directed against WikiLeaks and directed against Assange, not against The New York Times.</p><p end="4444" is_meta="false" speaker="Michael Chertoff" start="4381">But isn't that a great example --</p><p end="4444" is_meta="false" speaker="Alan Dershowitz" start="4381">And the defense is going to be essentially --</p><p end="4444" is_meta="false" speaker="Michael Chertoff" start="4381">Isn't that a great --</p><p end="4444" is_meta="false" speaker="Alan Dershowitz" start="4381">The Times published this, too. You're not going after them. Oh, no, you don&#8217;t go after The Times, we go after WikiLeaks because they don&#8217;t have the power--</p><p end="4444" is_meta="false" speaker="Michael Chertoff" start="4381">Alan, isn't that a great example -- I didn't want to bring up the WikiLeaks, but since you have I will.</p><p end="4444" is_meta="false" speaker="Alan Dershowitz" start="4381">Sure.</p><p end="4444" is_meta="true" speaker="Alan Dershowitz" start="4381">laughter</p><p end="4444" is_meta="false" speaker="Alan Dershowitz" start="4381">Michael Chertoff:Isn't that a great example of the fact that attributing ill motive to juries or to prosecutors or to the government omits the fact that there can be ill motive on the publisher? In the case of Assange, it's reported that his purpose in leaking the information as he told his associates is because he wants to make it impossible for the U.S. government to function by making it impossible for secrets to be held, so that people can&#8217;t have conversations.</p><p end="4444" is_meta="false" speaker="Alan Dershowitz" start="4381">So he's motivated by ill will to the United States. Now, is this the man we want to trust if God forbid he got a hold of the bin Laden attack plan, do we want to trust him to exercise his judgment?</p><p end="4444" is_meta="false" speaker="Alan Dershowitz" start="4381">And do we want to trust --</p><p end="4444" is_meta="false" speaker="Michael Chertoff" start="4381">Or would we rather trust people like those in this room?</p><p end="4444" is_meta="false" speaker="Alan Dershowitz" start="4381">No, do we want to prosecute -- or do we want to trust the prosecutor who misstates what Assange said and what his motive was, because he doesn't like Assange?</p><p end="4502" is_meta="false" speaker="Alan Dershowitz" start="4444">"Assange, I don't like, we're going to go after him. Times I like, we're going to go after him." If you leave this to motive analysis, do we know what the motive of The New York Times is? Is it to sell advertising? Is it to be powerful? Is it to help the government? A motive analysis, to be limiting freedom of the press would mean the end of the First Amendment.</p><p end="4561" is_meta="false" speaker="Michael Chertoff" start="4502">Well, I think --</p><p end="4561" is_meta="false" speaker="Michael Chertoff" start="4502">Oh, sorry.</p><p end="4561" is_meta="false" speaker="David Sanger" start="4502">Clearly, as any government official will happily tell you, they've got a wider range of information than the newspapers do. The reporter may be looking at a single document.</p><p end="4561" is_meta="false" speaker="David Sanger" start="4502">WikiLeaks was the great exception -- it was 250,000 documents and four million words -</p><p end="4561" is_meta="false" speaker="David Sanger" start="4502">- but usually, leaks are in dribs and drabs.</p><p end="4621" is_meta="false" speaker="David Sanger" start="4561">And the government would make the argument that they are in a much better position to judge. That would be a very convincing argument, if in fact, the government, when doing its classification, had to do in a serious, credible way, a measure between security risk and public's right to know. But the fact of the matter is -- as someone in the CIA said to me just last week -- no one ever got fired for stamping &#8220;classified&#8221; on a piece of paper.</p><p end="4621" is_meta="false" speaker="Michael Chertoff" start="4561">You know --</p><p end="4812" is_meta="false" speaker="Alan Dershowitz" start="4739">Well, I want to know if our water supply is vulnerable. I want to know if our infrastructure is vulnerable. I suspect there are enemies who already know that, and the issue about -- I think there's a lot of misunderstanding about what I said about the bin Laden raid -- I supported the bin Laden raid. I think it was legal. I think it was legitimate. I think we did a good job. I think we did a terrible job right after it in what information we revealed and what information we withheld. My only point was, if the United States government can't keep a secret like that, and if The New York Times learns about it, or Hezbollah learns about it, the press learns about it -- we have to really,</p><p end="4812" is_meta="false" speaker="Alan Dershowitz" start="4739">seriously think about whether this is an operation you want to have go forward. What worries me most is the attitude I've heard from some of the questions -- the government knows more than we know. We, the government, know better. You hear that from every tyrannical regime in the world. The government knows better. We live in a system where the government has to be checked by the press, where the press is checked by the government, where we have confusion, uncertainty, we have no ability to really know in advance how it will come out.</p><p end="4863" is_meta="false" speaker="Alan Dershowitz" start="4812">We don't know whether it would be a good thing or a bad thing. In retrospect, it was a good thing that bin Laden was killed and that the press didn't reveal it. It might have come out differently. We don't know. What we need are rules. And the rules that we have now --</p><p end="4863" is_meta="false" speaker="David Sanger" start="4812">Sure.</p><p end="4863" is_meta="false" speaker="David Sanger" start="4812">And my answer to that would be, in many cases, it makes the world significantly safer,</p><p end="4863" is_meta="false" speaker="David Sanger" start="4812">because the government is feeling some pressure, the U.S. government, to take a system that they may not have focused on entirely well and actually make it better. Let me give you an example that comes right from Mr. Chertoff's time when he was at Homeland Security.</p><p end="4925" is_meta="false" speaker="David Sanger" start="4863">President Bush would frequently laud the fact that imports into the United States go through nuclear detectors that were put at every port. And everyone knew, including many of the importers, that these nuclear detectors did not deal well with anything that was shielded. In other words, you could put through a lot of different material through the port of Los Angeles, and these detectors were frequently set off by kitchen tables, by Chinese toilets. Nuclear weapons, that was another issue. Now, at some point, many newspapers got around to writing about that. Did we put the United States at greater danger? No. I think in fact what we did was prod the U.S. government to move faster with the technology it needed to go get in place.</p><p end="4925" is_meta="false" speaker="Michael Chertoff" start="4863">Not eventually, up front. And that's the point, to answer the question.</p><p end="4982" is_meta="false" speaker="Michael Chertoff" start="4925">The government often itself will reveal, in a general sense, what the limitations are. In the case of these devices, it was that shielded material could not be detected. You had to add an additional device. Where I think there is a greater danger is if you get to a certain level of specificity. For example, if you want to talk about general vulnerability in the New York subway system, you can argue that that's not harmful. It's even helpful. If you want to say there's a particular location where a bomb would cause a crippling devastating blow to the operation of the system, that, I think, would make us unsafe, and that should be a state secret. And that's really what we're arguing for with this proposition.</p><p end="4982" is_meta="false" speaker="Gabriel Schoenfeld" start="4925">And we should add that --</p><p end="4982" is_meta="false" speaker="Gabriel Schoenfeld" start="4925">-- the other side has not really addressed this whole very striking example of the Swift program, where the Times revealed an ongoing operational intelligence-gathering program directed at al-Qaeda's finances.</p><p end="5040" is_meta="false" speaker="Gabriel Schoenfeld" start="4982">And it's true that the treasury secretary had mentioned that, in general terms, we were tracking their finances. But it certainly, until that story appeared in --</p><p end="5040" is_meta="false" speaker="Alan Dershowitz" start="4982">But let's assume for a moment --</p><p end="5040" is_meta="false" speaker="Alan Dershowitz" start="4982">-- that the Times was wrong. You didn't prosecute the Times. You don't have the guts to prosecute the Times. You will never prosecute the Times.</p><p end="5040" is_meta="false" speaker="Michael Chertoff" start="4982">I actually do.</p><p end="5040" is_meta="false" speaker="Alan Dershowitz" start="4982">You were a bunch of bullies. You would go after --</p><p end="5040" is_meta="false" speaker="Alan Dershowitz" start="4982">-- only the weakest and the most vulnerable.</p><p end="5040" is_meta="false" speaker="Michael Chertoff" start="4982">No, actually, I --</p><p end="5040" is_meta="false" speaker="Alan Dershowitz" start="4982">The First Amendment is not about The New York Times.</p><p end="5106" is_meta="false" speaker="Alan Dershowitz" start="5040">The First Amendment is about Drudge. The First Amendment is about extremist newspapers and magazines that are very unpopular. The First Amendment is about people who could never win a case in front of a jury. That's who the First Amendment's about. I don't worry about The New York Times. They can defend themselves. They knock down trees by the forest fulls. Governments don't go after --</p><p end="5106" is_meta="true" speaker="Alan Dershowitz" start="5040">laughter</p><p end="5166" is_meta="false" speaker="Michael Chertoff" start="5106">Well, I -- as the proponents --</p><p end="5166" is_meta="false" speaker="Michael Chertoff" start="5106">-- I think we say -- it does not say all state secrets. It says some state secrets. Or state secrets. You're right.</p><p end="5166" is_meta="true" speaker="Michael Chertoff" start="5106">laughter</p><p end="5166" is_meta="false" speaker="Michael Chertoff" start="5106">I'm sorry. I misspoke. But let me explain what I mean. We don't, as I said up front, we don't argue that everything that the government does is a state secret. We argue that some things are state secrets and that the reason the freedom of press has to give way is because there is a process for adjudicating what is state secrets that works, a process that requires, before there is punishment, that you go through a decision to prosecute, a judge winds up weighing in on it, and a jury winds up resolving it.</p><p end="5222" is_meta="false" speaker="Michael Chertoff" start="5166">And that under that circumstance, existing set of laws that do inhibit freedom of the press for state secrets work and ought to be kept. I believe my adversaries are arguing the existing set of laws are too discretionary, and we ought to have a recipe list, and only things in the recipe list ought to be prosecuted.</p><p end="5222" is_meta="false" speaker="Alan Dershowitz" start="5166">Well --</p><p end="5222" is_meta="false" speaker="Alan Dershowitz" start="5166">Well, no, I think -- I think the motion puts the burden on the proponents of the motion to justify the censorship of state secrets based on the term and the criteria "state secrets."</p><p end="5222" is_meta="false" speaker="Alan Dershowitz" start="5166">We are opposed to that. We concede that there are certain pieces of information that if properly legislated, and if discretion is reduced, and if anybody publishes them, they should be prosecuted. We concede that.</p><p end="5285" is_meta="false" speaker="Alan Dershowitz" start="5222">But the broad criteria of state secrets, as reflected by the Espionage Act of 1917, is far too discretionary and far too broad. And the basic issue is, should there be a presumption in favor of publication? That's our position. Should there be a presumption against publication, that's their position.</p><p end="5344" is_meta="false" speaker="David Sanger" start="5285">Yes.</p><p end="5344" is_meta="false" speaker="Gabriel Schoenfeld" start="5285">I wouldn't have come here to participate in a debate arguing for the proposition --</p><p end="5344" is_meta="false" speaker="Gabriel Schoenfeld" start="5285">-- that we should prosecute any, all state secrets. That would be an absurdity. I agree with our opponents here that the government wildly over-classifies and misclassifies, and that's a chronic problem. It's a problem that's not going to be reformed any time soon.</p><p end="5344" is_meta="false" speaker="Gabriel Schoenfeld" start="5285">But it means that there are categories of genuine secrets. That what we're talking about here. And what's ultimately at stake is that we live in a regime in which, in the final analysis, it's the democratic system, our Congress, the executive branch and the courts that get to decide which secrets are protected.</p><p end="5400" is_meta="false" speaker="Gabriel Schoenfeld" start="5344">The question is -- the question has been decided by our Congress, which has created a set of statutes, the Espionage Act and the other statutes I have mentioned, the Atomic Energy Act. And then the executive branch gets to carry out, enforce those statutes. And we live in a very liberal regime.</p><p end="5462" is_meta="false" speaker="Gabriel Schoenfeld" start="5400">In our whole history we've never had a successful prosecution of a journalist, and only one attempted prosecution. So I don't think there's much of a chilling effect, but the basic principle is in place. Freedom of the press does not extend to state secrets because the government has the final word; the jury has the final word.</p><p end="5462" is_meta="false" speaker="Alan Dershowitz" start="5400">Thomas Jefferson once said, "The law should be so crystal clear that you should be able to understand it if you read it while running."</p><p end="5462" is_meta="true" speaker="Alan Dershowitz" start="5400">laughter</p><p end="5462" is_meta="false" speaker="Alan Dershowitz" start="5400">And there is nothing vaguer than the Espionage Act of 1917. It gives the government total power to decide who to prosecute. Thus far, they have exercised their discretion during peacetime relatively well, during wartime very, very poorly, and the risks of greater prosecution during times of increasing crisis increase. We need to have rules of law, not counting on the discretion of prosecutors, the discretion of juries to protect our First Amendment. It's just too valuable.</p><p end="5462" is_meta="false" speaker="Gabriel Schoenfeld" start="5400">If we want to have a debate about the Espionage Act, I would think we'd probably be in agreement.</p><p end="5520" is_meta="false" speaker="Gabriel Schoenfeld" start="5462">It's a very vague act. It's [unintelligible] --</p><p end="5520" is_meta="false" speaker="Alan Dershowitz" start="5462">So would you favor its abolition? Would you favor its abolition?[talking simultaneously]</p><p end="5520" is_meta="false" speaker="Gabriel Schoenfeld" start="5462">-- its reform. But I don't feel -- but I think it's very difficult to reform --</p><p end="5520" is_meta="false" speaker="Gabriel Schoenfeld" start="5462">-- but I favor the basic principle.</p><p end="5520" is_meta="false" speaker="Michael Chertoff" start="5462">I do think the questioner absolutely put the question that really is dividing us, which is who decides? And I would argue and I think our proposition will be at the end of today that it is the combination of Congress having passed the law, the executive branch making its decision to prosecute, and the judge and the jury, you people, deciding whether to convict or not. That's where the ultimate decision has to be made, not in WikiLeaks or in Julian Assange's living room.</p><p end="5584" is_meta="false" speaker="David Sanger" start="5520">Thank you, John, and thanks to all of you. This has been a really interesting discussion that I think has revealed in our discussion of the ambiguity of the current law why a statement as broad as freedom of the press does not extend to state secrets can't stand simply because we cannot really define terribly well what is a true state secret worth protecting. In 29 years as a reporter, I've learned that on two things we almost always get it wrong. Whenever something has been leaked to me and I read stories later on about who the leaker was, it's almost invariably wrong, which tells you people get themotivations wrong. But the second thing is my own estimate about what the effects are of publishing a given story is also almost always wrong.</p><p end="5641" is_meta="false" speaker="David Sanger" start="5584">It's very difficult as you go in and write something to know whether or not it is actually going to have a very deleterious effect. And that's why we have ended up focusing on the narrowest questions, the obvious, the easy ones, the names of CIA agents, operations that are about to be conducted. Those are the easy questions. The hard question is what do you do to make sure that the press in the United States can force the government to debate policy on the most important questions, whether or not we invade a country and have the right evidence to go do so, whether or not we use a new weapon, whether it is a nuclear weapon in 1945 or a cyber weapon in 2011, and think out ahead what the effects could be once we legitimize that form of war.</p><p end="5701" is_meta="false" speaker="David Sanger" start="5641">You cannot do that unless you have a bias in favor of publication, not just a bias among all of us, but a legal bias in favor of publication, one that will make sure that the republic holds together because we have made ourselves different by pressing for publication whenever there is doubt.</p><p end="5762" is_meta="false" speaker="Gabriel Schoenfeld" start="5701">I agree with David Sanger on this last point, that we should have a system that has a bias in favor of publication -- including a legal bias -- and I think that's the system we have and the very vagueness of the Espionage Act actually has helped the press and created --</p><p end="5762" is_meta="false" speaker="Gabriel Schoenfeld" start="5701">helped us create a free press, the freest press in the world. And I think there's room forreform, but our government leaks like a sieve, and the press publishes secrets all the time.</p><p end="5762" is_meta="false" speaker="Gabriel Schoenfeld" start="5701">But I'm just reminded of an episode that occurred in late 2009, when a New York Times reporter -- one of your colleagues, David Rohde, was kidnapped by the Taliban. And Bill Keller, the executive editor of the paper, made the executive decision to withhold that information from the public. And not only did The Times not cover it, but he got all of his industry competitors and all of the Internet to agree not to reveal that David Rohde had been kidnapped. And the idea was he didn't want to do anything that would endanger Rohde's life.</p><p end="5821" is_meta="false" speaker="Gabriel Schoenfeld" start="5762">And of course, that was a speculative decision, because really, publishing information about Rohde -- the fact that he had been captured -- the Taliban knew he'd been captured.</p><p end="5821" is_meta="false" speaker="Gabriel Schoenfeld" start="5762">But they withheld the story. And I say to Bill Keller, &#8220;All honor to Bill Keller for that!&#8221;</p><p end="5821" is_meta="false" speaker="Gabriel Schoenfeld" start="5762">They protected the life of their guy. But when the decision involves non-journalists, it can't be. When it involves us. The people who ride the subway in New York. It can't be a voluntary decision up to Bill Keller. We -- and that's why we have laws on the books that in the final analysis, do allow for the prosecution of the journalists when they publish not just the random things that are stamped &#8220;secret&#8221; for no good reason, but the genuine,</p><p end="5821" is_meta="false" speaker="Gabriel Schoenfeld" start="5762">really hardcore secrets that place our lives in danger, including some of the things that your newspaper has published -- like the SWIFT story, once again.</p><p end="5821" is_meta="true" speaker="Gabriel Schoenfeld" start="5762">laughter</p><p end="5880" is_meta="false" speaker="Alan Dershowitz" start="5821">The proposition &#8220;Freedom of the press does not extend to state secrets&#8221; is far more dangerous than any of the state secrets that have allegedly been leaked during the 200 and some years of our republic. This is an extraordinarily dangerous proposition, saying that freedom of press doesn't extend to state secrets. That's where the other side has to add &#8220;genuine,&#8221; or &#8220;real,&#8221; or &#8220;some.&#8221; And I urge you to vote against this proposition, because if this proposition is passed, it sends an extremely dangerous message to the government -- that it continue business as usual. And the current situation is very clear. Anything that's published relating to national security today could be subject to prosecution. Whyaren't they prosecuted? Because the government -- the very government whose secrets are leaked -- makes the discretionary decision not to prosecute.</p><p end="5941" is_meta="false" speaker="Alan Dershowitz" start="5880">That is the wrong body to trust to make the decision, whether to prosecute. What we need is specific, focused, legislatively enacted rules that say that no one -- not a favorable press, not an unfavorable press -- can ever, under any circumstances, reveal fact A, fact B, fact C. That has to be subject to judicial review. That then has to be subject to trial by jury. The point is you don't trust juries and prosecutors with broad, overarching criminal statutes when it comes to the First Amendment. You narrow, you limit, and then you give it to the jury. But the last institution that should be making the decision who to prosecute is the very institution that is criticized by these revelations. So I urge you -- I urge you -- do not support this proposition.</p><p end="6010" is_meta="false" speaker="Alan Dershowitz" start="5941">This proposition is dangerous to your liberty. Thank you.</p><p end="6010" is_meta="false" speaker="Michael Chertoff" start="5941">Well, we support the proposition because the proof of the pudding is that we've had hundreds of years of American history where these statues have not been, in fact, a tool to oppress or to run rampant through the First Amendment. I think that our adversaries have essentially conceded that there are a category of state secrets that ought to be protected.</p><p end="6010" is_meta="false" speaker="Michael Chertoff" start="5941">And what they are arguing is the existing structure is somehow not definite enough. But I just want to spend one minute talking about what the existing law is. Because in fact, I think it strikes the right balance, which is the context in which we advocate this proposition. We have the Communications Intelligence Act protecting the information about our top secret code breaking and code making communications activity, quite specific, very reasonable and very understandable.</p><p end="6070" is_meta="false" speaker="Michael Chertoff" start="6010">That's what keeps us safe. We have the Intelligence Identities Act, keeping the names of intelligence agents safe as David acknowledges is appropriate and again part of the law.</p><p end="6070" is_meta="false" speaker="Michael Chertoff" start="6010">Even the Espionage Act, which has gotten the brunt of the fire power here, requires a finding by a jury beyond a reasonable doubt that there was intent to damage the nationalsecurity of the United States, not good intentions, not accident, not negligence, but bad intent to injure the security of the United States. I would argue that's exactly the kind of specificity that is appropriate in defining the category of state secrets that we are arguing ought to be protected under this proposition. And in fact the message that will be sent will not be one that will chill responsible reporters. It will be one that will chill the Julian Assanges who want to publish things because they want to hurt the United States and then want to claim the First Amendment to protect them against the consequences of that kind of decision.</p><p end="6119" is_meta="false" speaker="Michael Chertoff" start="6070">Thank you very much.</p></transcript></debate>
