He served in a couple local positions in New York City.</p><p end="425" is_meta="false" speaker="Karen Kornbluh" start="367">That fascinating.</p><p end="543" is_meta="false" speaker="Russell Roberts" start="490">We need to abolish the minimum wage. And there's only one argument that matters on this issue, and it's the moral argument. Does the minimum wage make the world a better place? And does it improve or hurt the lives of the poorest American families and the workers who are in those families? Now, those Americans with the least education and the lowest skill levels have struggled tremendously over the last three decades.</p><p end="543" is_meta="false" speaker="Russell Roberts" start="490">They find themselves in competition with machines, computers, automation, with foreign workers. Their job opportunities have shrunk. Their standard of living is mediocre at best, but the minimum wage is the wrong way to help those people. It attacks the effects of economic change rather than doing anything about the underlying causes. And by doing so, it hurts the people that we're trying to help.</p><p end="606" is_meta="false" speaker="Russell Roberts" start="543">You don't need a special theory of the labor market or a degree in economics to understand that making workers artificially more expensive makes it harder for them to find work. Now, those who support the minimum wage will tell you it's necessary to create a level playing field between employers and employees, that workers need the bargaining power that they are -- that they're missing, and the minimum wage makes that up. But in reality, most of us don't need that extra help. 95 percent of workers who are paid the hourly wage, which is about 75 million Americans -- 95 percent of those make more than the minimum wage already. And that includes my cleaning lady,</p><p end="606" is_meta="false" speaker="Russell Roberts" start="543">who I pay over two times the minimum wage. Now, why do I do that? Because I'm an incredibly nice person. Well, that's what I like to think. But I really know better,</p><p end="606" is_meta="false" speaker="Russell Roberts" start="543">because I'm an economist. The reason I play my cleaning lady almost $20 an hour is because if I don't, she doesn't show up. She has other alternatives that she will turn to if I don't meet her market wage. It is those alternatives that protect her from the greed of employers.</p><p end="670" is_meta="false" speaker="Russell Roberts" start="606">And alternatives force employers to treat employees well and most of us don't need legislation to protect us in the labor force. But the minimum wage does boost the salary of about 3.5 million Americans. About half of those, 1.7 million, are young people, 16 to 24. They get helped by the minimum wage as do those who make a little more than that, because it boosts the attractiveness of those workers relative to what it would otherwise be without the minimum wage. But those artificially high wages, that boost in wage discourages employers from hiring other workers who are low-skilled and have little experience. This is particularly tragic today, when the unemployment rate among 16-to 24-year-olds is 16 percent. And for African Americans -- young African Americans,it's over 29 percent. Almost one in three. Now, many who support the minimum wage will argue that somehow you could raise wages artificially and there'll be no net effect on employment.</p><p end="725" is_meta="false" speaker="Russell Roberts" start="670">But who believes that employers don't respond to incentives to higher wages and try to find ways to save costs? That's why employers replace workers with machines. That's why they send factories overseas. And that's why manufacturing employment has been falling steadily in recent decades, not just as a proportion of the total, but in absolute numbers, because fewer and fewer low-skilled workers who used to do those jobs are needed to produce the goods that we still make and manufacture. And by the way, the U.S. manufacturing sector, in output terms, is thriving. But in employment terms, it's struggling. And those are the places that people without a college degree used to find a good job. Those opportunities are shrinking.</p><p end="725" is_meta="false" speaker="Russell Roberts" start="670">Why would artificially increasing the wages of workers, especially those who don't go to college and who don't finish high school -- why would artificially increasing those wages make those workers better off?</p><p end="782" is_meta="false" speaker="Russell Roberts" start="725">Why would it have no effect on their employment? Consider my favorite exemption to the minimum wage: the internship. The internship is a very special kind of violation of the minimum wage. You pay zero. You're allowed to pay zero. You're allowed to pay less than the minimum wage as long as it's zero. How strange is that? But we all understand that, for our kids, that's a glorious thing. It's what's needed because their skills aren't often worth $7.25 an hour, and we want them to get that experience at the bottom of their -- at the beginning, at the bottom of the economic scene, so they can get the experience, and the mentoring, and all the things that come with being in the workplace. And thank goodness that there is a special exemption for zero. Does anybody think that if we got rid of that, there'd be more opportunities for young people? Others justify the minimum wage by saying the effects are small -- the employment effects. Small? When you lose your job or can't find one, the effect isn't small, it's 100 percent.</p><p end="844" is_meta="false" speaker="Russell Roberts" start="782">So it's nice to give 1.7 million young workers a raise, but what about the 3.4 million unemployed workers 16-to-24, last month, who can't find work? We're increasing the wages of 1.7 million and making it harder for 3.4 million to find work, twice as many. I don't accept that tradeoff. That's a tragedy. I reject it. It's a bad bargain. The irony of the minimum wage is that it reduces the bargaining power of the people at the bottom end. It reduces the number of opportunities they have while increasing the number of people who are trying to find them. The best argument for the minimum wage is thatour school system is a failure, so we have to do something to help those at the bottom.</p><p end="844" is_meta="false" speaker="Russell Roberts" start="782">But this is the wrong way to fix it. It's an additional barrier to the least skilled workers of America, making it harder for them to find work, those who have the least education,</p><p end="844" is_meta="false" speaker="Russell Roberts" start="782">the least ability, the fewest connections, the ones who desperately need that first job to start their career. I beg you to consider that the best intentions don't always lead to good results. Abolish the minimum wage.</p><p end="907" is_meta="false" speaker="Russell Roberts" start="844">Let young people and the least skilled have a better chance of getting the experience they need to thrive and prosper. Thank you very much.</p><p end="907" is_meta="true" speaker="Russell Roberts" start="844">applause</p><p end="907" is_meta="false" speaker="Jared Bernstein" start="844">Well, I'm glad to see all of you here and that you've chosen this over other D.C. options you had tonight. You could be looking at the cherry blossoms or seeing the Nationals play, but you've come to talk and debate the minimum wage, so you're my kind of people. So I'm glad you're here.</p><p end="907" is_meta="true" speaker="Jared Bernstein" start="844">laughter</p><p end="907" is_meta="false" speaker="Jared Bernstein" start="844">Here is my main point. Luckily, for our side, strongly against abolishing the minimum wage, almost everything you just heard from Russ is shown to be false by a large body of compelling research.</p><p end="966" is_meta="false" speaker="Jared Bernstein" start="907">So let me start with my main point. Abolishing the minimum wage would be a terrible policy mistake that would needlessly hurt millions of low wage workers. It's not a policy,</p><p end="966" is_meta="false" speaker="Jared Bernstein" start="907">this idea of abolishing the minimum wage. This policy is nowhere near the current agenda. In fact, as you've heard, the current debate asks whether the minimum wage should be increased. Now, it is true that during the Republican primary, Michele Bachmann and Herman Cain endorsed the idea in the Republican primary of abolishing the minimum wage, but that idea of abolishing a policy that's been in place since the1930s, helping low wage workers, is about as far out of the mainstream as you can get,</p><p end="966" is_meta="false" speaker="Jared Bernstein" start="907">and let me explain why.</p><p end="966" is_meta="false" speaker="Jared Bernstein" start="907">Now, this gray hair I have, I got through a lifetime, as was mentioned earlier, of analyzing social and economic policies, beginning as a social worker in New York City with the poor, and I worked my way -- I don't want to say up, sideways, wherever it is I am now -- to whatever it is I'm doing today.</p><p end="1025" is_meta="false" speaker="Jared Bernstein" start="966">And, you know, over those decades, I focused on two things, what's gone wrong in our economy and which policies could help give less advantaged folks a shot, a fair chance?</p><p end="1025" is_meta="false" speaker="Jared Bernstein" start="966">It's through that simple agenda that decades ago I became interested in minimum wage policy. As globalization, and technological change, and a lot of other stuff that we can talk about throughout the evening have evolved, economic growth no longer reaches working families the way it used to. And the further you go down the pay scale, the less growth you're likely to see. The minimum wage partially helps offset that problem.</p><p end="1025" is_meta="false" speaker="Jared Bernstein" start="966">And, in fact, you will be hard pressed to find a policy that does what it sets out to do,</p><p end="1025" is_meta="false" speaker="Jared Bernstein" start="966">raising the pay of low wage workers, more effectively or more efficiently. And importantly, and this is why I stressed it when I started, and we'll have lots of time to get into this, I hope, reams of high quality research shows that it does so with the minimum of the type of side effects that you heard Russ emphasize.</p><p end="1082" is_meta="false" speaker="Jared Bernstein" start="1025">Consider this, just start here with a little commonsense thought experiment. The American minimum wage, as you've heard, has been in place since 1938, 75 years ago.</p><p end="1082" is_meta="false" speaker="Jared Bernstein" start="1025">It has been raised 22 times. Nineteen states now have their own minimum wages above the federal level. If this policy was so damaging, as damaging as Russ claims, that it needs to be abolished, how could it be that citizens and legislatures in 19 states decided not to abolish it, but to raise it above the federal level? If it was anywhere near as damaging as our opponents claim, how could the minimum wage not only have survived this long, but have flourished and expanded? The answer, once again, is because it's widely understood and accepted by mainstream economics, policymakers,</p><p end="1082" is_meta="false" speaker="Jared Bernstein" start="1025">and perhaps most importantly, low-wage workers themselves, who overwhelmingly support the policy -- that's very important, I'll come back to that -- as doing what it's supposed to do, steering a bit more of the economic growth their way.</p><p end="1144" is_meta="false" speaker="Jared Bernstein" start="1082">Now, to do what our opponents advocate, to get rid of the minimum wage, would figuratively take the wage floor out from under millions of low-wage workers, many of whom -- and Karen will emphasize these points -- depend on the minimum wage to support their families. =t's very misleading to say that this is just a teenagers&#8217; issue. =t's not. For these reasons, as you've heard, the president has proposed an increase in thefederal -- in the federal minimum wage. Now, that's what we ought to actually be debating. I firmly believe that economists can and should have good, robust debates about that kind of a proposal -- should the minimum wage be increased or not? But that's not what we're arguing about. That's not what you're voting on on the resolution.</p><p end="1144" is_meta="false" speaker="Jared Bernstein" start="1082">Our opponents think that America should have no minimum wage at all. To me, a better question than that -- than the one on notice tonight, should be -- should the minimum wage be abolished? The better question is why anyone would even suggest such a bad idea? So, why would you -- why would you even think that?</p><p end="1144" is_meta="false" speaker="Jared Bernstein" start="1082">And I think the answer comes down to two factors. First, common misconceptions,</p><p end="1144" is_meta="false" speaker="Jared Bernstein" start="1082">ones that should have been banished by the research.</p><p end="1207" is_meta="false" speaker="Jared Bernstein" start="1144">And second, because of a laissez-faire market ideology that trumps common sense and empirical evidence. Now, a word about this evidence. There's probably no question that's been analyzed more carefully by economists than this one, about the impact of the minimum wage on low-wage workers. And the conclusion is that it raises the pay of low-wage workers without hurting their jobs prospects. Of literally thousands of estimates on the impact of the minimum wage on job impacts of affected workers, the vast majority find that the benefits to low-wage workers -- the benefits to low-wage workers -- exactly the opposite of what's -- of what Russell claims -- the benefits for low-</p><p end="1207" is_meta="false" speaker="Jared Bernstein" start="1144">wage workers far outweigh any costs in terms of reduced hours or job loss.</p><p end="1207" is_meta="false" speaker="Jared Bernstein" start="1144">Now, recall that I mentioned all of these states with their own minimum wage levels exist. That's provided something that minimum wage researchers have found very rare in economics -- pseudo-experimentation. The best way to test the impact of an intervention like this is to compare places that are as like -- as -- in terms of economic variables as you can find.</p><p end="1263" is_meta="false" speaker="Jared Bernstein" start="1207">Yet, one has the economic intervention and the other doesn't. These studies, this pseudo-experimentation, comparing states and places across borders, have consistently found results, job loss effects, that hover around zero. Sometimes a little bit below. I will grant the other side that. Sometimes slightly negative, sometimes slightly positive,</p><p end="1263" is_meta="false" speaker="Jared Bernstein" start="1207">but hover around zero.</p><p end="1263" is_meta="false" speaker="Jared Bernstein" start="1207">So we have here a simple policy that for 75 years, has been doing what it's designed to do with little fanfare and minimal, if any, negative side effects. Abolishing it makes absolutely no sense at all. Thank you.</p><p end="1263" is_meta="true" speaker="Jared Bernstein" start="1207">applause</p><p end="1263" is_meta="false" speaker="Jared Bernstein" start="1207">John Donvan:Thank you. Jared Bernstein. Thank you, Jared Bernstein. And a reminder of what's going on. We are halfway through the opening round of this Intelligence Squared U.S.</p><p end="1263" is_meta="false" speaker="Jared Bernstein" start="1207">debate. I'm John Donvan. We have four debaters, two teams of two, fighting it out over this motion, &#8220;Abolish the minimum wage.&#8221; You have heard two of the opening statements, and now onto the third.</p><p end="1322" is_meta="false" speaker="Jared Bernstein" start="1263">Debating in support of the motion, to abolish the minimum wage, the vice president for academic affairs at the Cato Institute, editor of the Cato Journal, and professor of economics at Towson University. Ladies and gentlemen, James Dorn.</p><p end="1322" is_meta="true" speaker="Jared Bernstein" start="1263">applause</p><p end="2162" is_meta="false" speaker="Russell Roberts" start="2110">Well, we can't answer that precisely.</p><p end="2220" is_meta="false" speaker="Russell Roberts" start="2162">Well, I don't know. I think some employers would take advantage of the change in the law to lower wages. And they would have lower income. The question is, what's the right way to help people who have low skills or who are struggling for all kinds of reasons, many of which are not their fault? We have a horrible school system. We ought to fix our school system instead of trying to help people through this artificial method. If the artificial method worked, I'd be -- it'd be great. It'd be great. When Karen says we can afford it, we can afford it, this group, because we all make more than the minimum wage.</p><p end="2281" is_meta="false" speaker="Russell Roberts" start="2220">And I would guess that most of the people in this room -- because 95 percent of the American workforce does earn more than the minimum wage, it would have very little effect on us. It's the people that we don't see, people who have the toughest time finding work, who are punished by this good intention -- well-intentioned law.</p><p end="2281" is_meta="false" speaker="Russell Roberts" start="2220">That's correct.</p><p end="2281" is_meta="false" speaker="Jared Bernstein" start="2220">Correct. You're leaving out at least 2 million salaried workers. Salaried workers are not exempt from the minimum wage, so that number is wrong. Here's --</p><p end="2281" is_meta="false" speaker="Russell Roberts" start="2220">What's the source of that --</p><p end="2281" is_meta="false" speaker="Jared Bernstein" start="2220">Here's -- let me finish.</p><p end="2281" is_meta="false" speaker="Russell Roberts" start="2220">What's the source for 2 million? Because the BLS doesn't collect that data.</p><p end="2281" is_meta="false" speaker="Jared Bernstein" start="2220">Oh, absolutely. No, no, no. This is -- this is from the current population survey.</p><p end="2281" is_meta="false" speaker="Russell Roberts" start="2220">Okay.</p><p end="2281" is_meta="false" speaker="Jared Bernstein" start="2220">Look --</p><p end="2281" is_meta="false" speaker="Jared Bernstein" start="2220">Russ Roberts --</p><p end="2281" is_meta="false" speaker="Russell Roberts" start="2220">They don't collect the hours data in [unintelligible].</p><p end="2281" is_meta="false" speaker="Jared Bernstein" start="2220">Russ is a friend of mine. I like Russ.</p><p end="2281" is_meta="true" speaker="Jared Bernstein" start="2220">laughter</p><p end="2348" is_meta="false" speaker="Jared Bernstein" start="2281">You know there was a "but" there. No, I like Russ a lot. But I am a -- I am aghast to hear Russ say, &#8220;how many people would this hurt? Who would this hurt? How would it hurt them? = don't know.&#8221; That's what he just said, "I don't know." You cannot, in my mind,</p><p end="2348" is_meta="false" speaker="Jared Bernstein" start="2281">in good faith, in this economy, in any economy, talk about abolishing the minimum wage and not know what its impact is going to be. That's way, way too reckless.</p><p end="2348" is_meta="true" speaker="Jared Bernstein" start="2281">applause</p><p end="2348" is_meta="false" speaker="Jared Bernstein" start="2281">Now, the idea that workers are hurt by this the way Russ and Jim have argued is belied by research that looks very carefully at changes in minimum wages across different economies and different groups. Now, I don't want to get -- I don't know if we want to go there now, but we need some time to explain, I think, to the audience, what the research actually shows. You can't just say, "Black unemployment is high, and we have minimum wages, therefore high minimum wages cause high black unemployment,"</p><p end="2348" is_meta="false" speaker="Jared Bernstein" start="2281">because we've had periods when we've raised the minimum wage in the 1990s, we've raised the minimum wage in 1996, black unemployment came way down.</p><p end="2408" is_meta="false" speaker="Jared Bernstein" start="2348">So I'm not saying that it came way down because we had a higher minimum wage. I'm saying there are a lot of moving parts. And the best research compares the impact of the minimum wage controlling for those moving parts. And that's what we've been citing.</p><p end="2408" is_meta="false" speaker="Russell Roberts" start="2348">May I respond to my friend?</p><p end="2462" is_meta="false" speaker="Karen Kornbluh" start="2408">Thank you, John, because I made the moral argument, but I think it's really important to get the economic argument right. And I think the economic argument sounds like it's on their side, but it's absolutely not. It's -- I like them both very much as well.</p><p end="2462" is_meta="true" speaker="Karen Kornbluh" start="2408">laughter</p><p end="2524" is_meta="false" speaker="Karen Kornbluh" start="2462">But I think good economics says that you have to make sure that you're not -- that you're actually looking at causality and that you're taking account of all of the variables.</p><p end="2524" is_meta="false" speaker="Karen Kornbluh" start="2462">And what the economic studies really show is that there are a lot of other things that affect unemployment and that produce unemployment or employment. And thosehave to do with the overall state of the economy, has to do with education. And it's just overly simplistic --</p><p end="2524" is_meta="false" speaker="Karen Kornbluh" start="2462">-- analysis to say that -- that the minimum wage actually produces unemployment even [unintelligible] --</p><p end="2524" is_meta="false" speaker="Karen Kornbluh" start="2462">I think what we need to focus on, though, for those people -- and they've said it again and again, and I absolutely agree, and we can all go out agreeing on this, is, we need to improve our education system. We need to get access to vocational education.</p><p end="2582" is_meta="false" speaker="Karen Kornbluh" start="2524">We need to get access to higher education. That's what you need in a knowledge economy. And so I think we all agree on what we need to do for those people.</p><p end="2582" is_meta="false" speaker="Russell Roberts" start="2524">I want to just say something general about the empirical literature on the minimum wage. There have been hundreds of studies done on both sides, actually hundreds have found that the minimum wage reduces employment. That was the consensus among economists until the Card and Krueger study in the 1990s. And that consensus has shifted somewhat. Now there are many economists who think that the effects are either small or minimal. Again, I would emphasize that small to me does not mean it's irrelevant. Small is still people's lives. But the point is that both --</p><p end="2649" is_meta="false" speaker="Russell Roberts" start="2582">Seriously, I've been on many panels with Jared. We have a good time. Those studies haven't convinced -- those studies that show that there have been serious losses of jobs,</p><p end="2649" is_meta="false" speaker="Russell Roberts" start="2582">which Jim mentioned one of them, the Sabia, Burkhauser, Hanson study of New York workers, 20 percent drop in workers without a high school diploma. That's an incredible tragedy. They don't find that persuasive. The study wasn't done well. Strangely enough, we don't find the studies that find the other side persuasive as well. There's a big ideological gap between these two sides that we should be honest about, because if the studies were great, they would win. They would convince people. But the reason they don't convince people is that the world is a complicated place, as both Karen and Jared have said. There's a lot of things going on at once, and it's really hard to hold things constant. It gets a lot harder when the minimum wage affects a relatively small part of the population. So when 95 percent of Jared -- if I want to accept some of your salaried workers, some slightly smaller percentage of the workers earn more than minimum wage already, yeah, it's going to be hard to tease out the independent effect of that relative to all the other things that change in the economy at the same time.</p><p end="2709" is_meta="false" speaker="Russell Roberts" start="2649">So it's very hard to do. It's not persuasive to the opponents.</p><p end="2709" is_meta="false" speaker="Jared Bernstein" start="2649">I think that's -- I think that's a very fair --</p><p end="2709" is_meta="false" speaker="Jared Bernstein" start="2649">I think that's a very fair assessment of the literature. And, you know, you keep -- the other side keeps citing the work of David Neumark. I think David Neumark, he -- you've got --</p><p end="2709" is_meta="false" speaker="Jared Bernstein" start="2649">John Donvan:Has everybody read the David Neumark?</p><p end="2709" is_meta="false" speaker="Jared Bernstein" start="2649">No, no.</p><p end="2709" is_meta="true" speaker="Jared Bernstein" start="2649">laughter</p><p end="2709" is_meta="false" speaker="Jared Bernstein" start="2649">So you've got -- you know, the -- I thought Russ described it well. You've got the Krueger and Card and a lot of other studies that showzero or slightly positive. David Neumark and others show slightly -- now, I recently corresponded with Neumark about this because we did a study at the Center on Budget -- we're doing a study. And we said, &#8220;David, what should we plug in to accurately represent the job loss effects that you, and our opposition, believe occurred?&#8221; Because we want to be fair, just like =</p><p end="2709" is_meta="false" speaker="Jared Bernstein" start="2649">thought Russ was pretty fair. And he said, essentially, a 10 percent increase in the minimum wage will lead to a 1 percent decline in the employment of teenage workers.</p><p end="2761" is_meta="false" speaker="Jared Bernstein" start="2709">Now, if that occurs, that means that 99 percent of affected workers get a pay raise.</p><p end="2761" is_meta="false" speaker="Jared Bernstein" start="2709">Now, our opponents have consistently said, if 1 percent loses a job or loses hours of work, yet somehow 99 percent get a raise, it's a bad deal. That's just, I think,</p><p end="2761" is_meta="false" speaker="Jared Bernstein" start="2709">economically a very -- a very misleading [unintelligible].</p><p end="2948" is_meta="false" speaker="Jared Bernstein" start="2880">Sure. That's a great question. Like any other theoretical notion -- and it is a theoretical notion; a very cogent one, as you mentioned. It has to be empirically tested. You can't in economics -- this is not science, this is social science. It's different. You have to testit. And the tests that have been applied have been, I think, very careful pseudo-</p><p end="3002" is_meta="false" speaker="Russell Roberts" start="2948">Yeah.</p><p end="3002" is_meta="false" speaker="Russell Roberts" start="2948">Well, Jared and I agree on something very important, which is economics is not a science. That's good. It's a start. It's more like history with a lot of numbers. It's nothing like physics or the sciences. So to me, the word "social" in front of it, it's a very important qualifier. And I think the challenge is the empirical evidence that Jared's talking about, I view as very unpersuasive. And it's -- I know it's unpersuasive because it doesn't persuade the opponents.</p><p end="3065" is_meta="false" speaker="Russell Roberts" start="3002">No one reads these studies that are full of equations, and Greek letters, and lots of fancy statistical work, and go, "Oh, my gosh --"</p><p end="3065" is_meta="false" speaker="Russell Roberts" start="3002">John Donvan:But can they be persuaded?</p><p end="3065" is_meta="false" speaker="Russell Roberts" start="3002">"-- I've been wrong all my life." I don't know. It doesn't happen.</p><p end="3065" is_meta="true" speaker="Russell Roberts" start="3002">talking simultaneously</p><p end="3065" is_meta="false" speaker="Russell Roberts" start="3002">In theory it could, but I -- everybody always says, "Oh, they left this out. They didn't do this right." They always have a reason, and that's because of the fundamental complexity of human society. So I want to ask instead of that -- those kinds of studies which = don&#8217;t think persuade even economists, and they shouldn't persuade you, = want to ask you to do the following experiment. If you decided to quit your job, you didn't like your job, you were bored, you wanted to try something else, and now you're going to go out in the workplace and find a new job, but the government passes a law that for you to be -- when you go to your new job, your new employer has to pay you, say -- let's pick a small -- relatively small number, 20 percent more than your current job. That's the law. So you've switched jobs, you&#8217;ve got to get 20 percent more, do you think that would be good for you or bad for you? You realize -- and my question is to my opponents, do you think that would make it harder for you to find work? They're arguing that, "Oh, empirically -- it's an empirical question. Empirically, it doesn't have any effect when you artificially raise people's wages."</p><p end="3125" is_meta="false" speaker="Russell Roberts" start="3065">So you, you have no extra skills, nothing new, you come into the workforce, "Yay, the government's passed a law. You have to be paid 20 percent more than in your last job."</p><p end="3125" is_meta="false" speaker="Russell Roberts" start="3065">Would you be happy? Would you be excited about that? I think you'd be scared. I would be. I think it's very difficult.</p><p end="3125" is_meta="false" speaker="Karen Kornbluh" start="3065">But before I respond to that, I just want to lay out another thought experiment, which is that if you are really serious, if you really thought that teenagers couldn't work at the minimum wage, and that it was keeping them out of the workforce, then what you might look at -- and some countries that have very, very high minimum wages have looked at this -- is a separate minimum wage for teens. We have a separate minimumwage for tip workers. I'm not saying those are something that I would -- that's something that I would endorse, but if you're really serious about a separate population needing to get entry, that's what you would do. I mean, we're very lucky. We have an easier case to make, because the proposition on the floor is abolishing the minimum wage.</p><p end="3187" is_meta="false" speaker="Karen Kornbluh" start="3125">You do not have to go to abolishing the minimum wage to address the arguments that our opponents have brought up even if you take them at face value.</p><p end="3304" is_meta="false" speaker="Jared Bernstein" start="3245">So, let me -- let me --</p><p end="3304" is_meta="false" speaker="Jared Bernstein" start="3245">-- refine. Jim and Russ talk a lot about freedom -- interferes with workers' freedom.</p><p end="3304" is_meta="false" speaker="Jared Bernstein" start="3245">This is bad for workers. Workers don't want this. So everybody's had a chance to do a thought experiment except me. So here&#8217;s the thought experiment. =magine a poll that asks a bunch of low-wage workers, &#8220;Would you support abolishing the minimum wage?&#8221;</p><p end="3304" is_meta="false" speaker="Jared Bernstein" start="3245">Okay?</p><p end="3304" is_meta="false" speaker="Jared Bernstein" start="3245">[laughter]Do that little thought experiment and see if that interferes with workers' freedom. In fact, 90 percent of Americans earning less than 24,000 a year support raising the minimum wage. So go ask them about abolishing it and see what they say about their freedom to choose.</p><p end="3304" is_meta="false" speaker="Jared Bernstein" start="3245">Okay. Now, listen, Jim. If you're going to find one case of one person who loses their job and say, &#8220;We should abolish the minimum wage,&#8221; you're nuts.</p><p end="3364" is_meta="false" speaker="Jared Bernstein" start="3304">It's that simple.</p><p end="3364" is_meta="true" speaker="Jared Bernstein" start="3304">laughter</p><p end="3364" is_meta="false" speaker="Jared Bernstein" start="3304">I mean, it --</p><p end="3364" is_meta="true" speaker="Jared Bernstein" start="3304">applause</p><p end="3364" is_meta="false" speaker="Jared Bernstein" start="3304">And I am not -- I am not saying -- I am not saying you can't find that lady. In fact, the research --</p><p end="3364" is_meta="false" speaker="Jared Bernstein" start="3304">I agreed with Russ that the research shows there are small negative impacts from some studies. Some studies show small positive impacts.</p><p end="3364" is_meta="false" speaker="Russell Roberts" start="3304">Yeah. And --</p><p end="3364" is_meta="false" speaker="Russell Roberts" start="3304">Yeah. I'll let Jim go first.</p><p end="3364" is_meta="false" speaker="Jared Bernstein" start="3304">But I like you.</p><p end="3422" is_meta="false" speaker="Karen Kornbluh" start="3364">Okay. So, I just -- sorry, Russ.</p><p end="3422" is_meta="false" speaker="Karen Kornbluh" start="3364">But you did just undermine your point completely --</p><p end="3481" is_meta="false" speaker="Russell Roberts" start="3422">Great --</p><p end="3481" is_meta="false" speaker="Russell Roberts" start="3422">Karen Kornbluh:-- because you just said that the current minimum wage is not creating problems. Your position is to abolish the minimum wage. Where our -- it's not -- the question on the table is not whether to raise the minimum wage, it's whether to get rid of it entirely at its current, low rate.</p><p end="3481" is_meta="false" speaker="Russell Roberts" start="3422">You're not quoting me quite accurately. I didn't say it wasn't causing any problems. I said the problems are relatively small and they're hard to measure. And as a result, it's relatively pleasant for most people because 95 percent of the people don't need it who aren't in the hourly -- who earn an hourly wage.</p><p end="3481" is_meta="false" speaker="Karen Kornbluh" start="3422">I just think that we have to be really, really careful. I mean, you guys have tossed around a lot of studies. I think if we know that at our current low minimum wage, we are not causing problems, why on earth, because of some abstract notion or some theory about economics that's not proven in the empirical literature, do we want to subject low income families to an experiment of throwing out minimum wage which is a support for them and their families?</p><p end="3539" is_meta="false" speaker="Russell Roberts" start="3481">Because every worker who earns -- whose productivity is under $7.25 an hour right now is having a very difficult time making their way in the world, especially young workers.</p><p end="3539" is_meta="false" speaker="Jared Bernstein" start="3481">So that gets to the heart of the theory where I think Russ and Jim go wrong. What you just heard from Russ is a standard econ 101 theory, which is, workers are paid their marginal product. They are paid what they contribute to their firm's value at the margin. Now, if you believe that, you know very little about the actual labor market.</p><p end="3602" is_meta="false" speaker="Russell Roberts" start="3539">I would have a slightly different perspective on this.</p><p end="3602" is_meta="false" speaker="Russell Roberts" start="3539">I think part of the problem we have with education right now is that we've subsidized it,</p><p end="3602" is_meta="false" speaker="Russell Roberts" start="3539">which is a lovely idea. And as a result, it's pushed up tuition, and it's allowed colleges to raise their prices, their tuition a great deal. And as a result, many students have borrowed have a lot of money. And as a result, they're in big trouble. And especially in a downtime of economic growth when economic growth is so mediocre.</p><p end="3668" is_meta="false" speaker="Karen Kornbluh" start="3602">Yeah, I do think this is really tied to the minimum wage issue because we have to remember that we live in a knowledge economy. And a country's human capital is what it competes on. And so what we need to do to be competitive, to have productivity, to have the American dream again, to have people earning high wages and being able tosupport their families is investing in people's education. And so we have a big problem in this country in terms of K-12, and we have a big problem in terms of --</p><p end="3668" is_meta="false" speaker="Karen Kornbluh" start="3602">That's what we should adjust and not the minimum wage.</p><p end="3668" is_meta="false" speaker="Karen Kornbluh" start="3602">Oh, no. So what I was saying is that I think the moral argument is on our side because those families need the minimum wage to support their kids. What they were saying is that somehow the minimum wage hurts those families and keeps them out of the workplace. I think the way you deal with people who are out of the workplace is you get education and training.</p><p end="3728" is_meta="false" speaker="Karen Kornbluh" start="3668">They're saying they care about the same people, but they're saying that the minimum wage hurts them. I'm saying the minimum wage helps them.</p><p end="3778" is_meta="false" speaker="Russell Roberts" start="3728">The living wage isn't by the taxpayer. I think it's usually a proposal to just have a higher minimum wage that would be able to support a family more easily. What kind of business do you have? I'll repeat it for those -- since you have the mic.</p><p end="3778" is_meta="false" speaker="Russell Roberts" start="3728">You have a consulting business. And your workers are paid -- you said you have some that are paid $8.25 an hour?</p><p end="3778" is_meta="false" speaker="Russell Roberts" start="3728">So none of your workers earn the minimum wage.</p><p end="3846" is_meta="false" speaker="Russell Roberts" start="3778">No. There are some who do, though, and that's very hard on them, and that's no doubt about it. Right now there's a proposal with the city council of Washington to increase the minimum wage for special stores that have large footprints. This would be stores like Costco and Home Depot and super Wal-Mart. There are very few of those in Washington, D.C. But they want to raise it to 11-something an hour. The Washington Post came out the other day and said it's a horrible idea because Costco will leave. They won't be able to make a living, unfortunately. They have a lot of profit, but at $11.25,</p><p end="3846" is_meta="false" speaker="Russell Roberts" start="3778">it's not clear they'll be able to keep that store in Washington. And The Washington Post thinks that's a bad idea. I do too. I think it's a bad idea to -- especially to pick out special stores.</p><p end="3846" is_meta="false" speaker="Russell Roberts" start="3778">What?</p><p end="3846" is_meta="false" speaker="Russell Roberts" start="3778">Sorry.</p><p end="3846" is_meta="true" speaker="Russell Roberts" start="3778">laughter</p><p end="3846" is_meta="false" speaker="Russell Roberts" start="3778">Afterwards, I'm happy to talk some more.</p><p end="3846" is_meta="false" speaker="Jared Bernstein" start="3778">Thank you. If -- first of all, again, these are empirical questions. If I communicate nothing to you tonight, that would be the thing that I'd want to leave you with. You can't make the assumptions that our opposition does about what happens with living wages or minimum wages.</p><p end="3899" is_meta="false" speaker="Jared Bernstein" start="3846">And this has been studied, again, fairly carefully, not as much as minimum wages, but living wages have not been found to have the distortionary effects that Russ suggested.</p><p end="3899" is_meta="false" speaker="Jared Bernstein" start="3846">I do think the questioner gets into a very important point that we haven't touched on yet. If you abolish the minimum wage, and it falls a lot -- because by the way, if it doesn't fall a lot, then it can't possibly have the problems that they're suggesting. That was the point Karen made. But if you abolish the minimum wage, and it falls a lot, you will collect fewer payroll taxes. You will have to pay more in food stamps. You will have to pay more in unemployment insurance. You have to pay more in welfare benefits.</p><p end="3899" is_meta="false" speaker="Jared Bernstein" start="3846">And it is very much a transfer of the burden of poverty to the taxpayer in ways that minimum wages and living wages help to mitigate.</p><p end="3899" is_meta="true" speaker="Jared Bernstein" start="3846">applause</p><p end="4023" is_meta="false" speaker="Russell Roberts" start="3971">I'm comfortable. I don't see any fruit. I hear the applause, but I don't see any fruit, so I'm feeling pretty good.</p><p end="4142" is_meta="false" speaker="Russell Roberts" start="4084">I would just say there are a lot of policies I would prefer to the minimum wage. The earned income tax credit is preferable to the minimum wage. Improving our school system is preferable to the minimum wage. And I certainly agree with Karen that people like to stand on their own two feet, and I would emphasize, once again, that the minimum wage makes it harder, not easier.</p><p end="4268" is_meta="false" speaker="Jared Bernstein" start="4209">I'm sorry. You've got to look at the evidence, and we -- the planners of today's event, I think wisely, decided we shouldn't use PowerPoint.</p><p end="4268" is_meta="true" speaker="Jared Bernstein" start="4209">laughter</p><p end="4268" is_meta="false" speaker="Jared Bernstein" start="4209">That's a -- that's too bad in an evidentiary [unintelligible], but I support --</p><p end="4268" is_meta="false" speaker="Jared Bernstein" start="4209">And it's the radio, too, you know?</p><p end="4268" is_meta="true" speaker="Jared Bernstein" start="4209">laughter</p><p end="4268" is_meta="false" speaker="Jared Bernstein" start="4209">Graphs don't work as well on the radio. But what I have here in front of me is a graph that I'll show to anybody afterwards and -- that just frankly contradicts this notion that particularly Jim but Jim and Russ have hit on all night, common sense, common sense --</p><p end="4268" is_meta="false" speaker="Jared Bernstein" start="4209">no. It's not common sense because there are lots of different ways. And I articulated them. You mistakenly said, "These guys think nothing happens when you raise the minimum wage." I gave you three good Ps as to the different things that happen. So the dynamics of the economy are such that the questioner is exactly right. You would not find a great deal of increased employment because the minimum wage is notcurrently a disemploying mechanism within the economy, but what you would find is a ton more poverty.</p><p end="4328" is_meta="false" speaker="Jared Bernstein" start="4268">And you have to consider this in the context of the EITC, Mr. Questioner over there,</p><p end="4328" is_meta="false" speaker="Jared Bernstein" start="4268">because if you take a minimum wage that's $7 an hour and you apply a 40 percent EITC to it, you're adding $2.80.</p><p end="4328" is_meta="false" speaker="Jared Bernstein" start="4268">Oh, the Earned Income Tax Credit, a wage subsidy for low wage workers, if you apply the current wage subsidy to a $7 minimum wage hour, it's 40 percent at the max, that's $2.80. Apply that to a $3 wage, which may be where it's going to fall -- Russ doesn't know, but it could be. Now you're talking about one-twenty -- $1.20 subsidy to that wage. So it's a $2.80 subsidy at the current minimum wage level. If that falls by half then the subsidy falls by half.</p><p end="4441" is_meta="false" speaker="Karen Kornbluh" start="4381">One quick thing. We think that the minimum wage also affects those who earn just above the minimum wage, that it props up wages just above. So if you look at the people who earn at the minimum wage or just above, as I said at the beginning, we have one quarter of all children in the U.S., more than 17 million kids, who have a parent who earns at the minimum wage or just above who we think would be affected.</p><p end="4441" is_meta="false" speaker="Russell Roberts" start="4381">Well, I agree. It does --</p><p end="4441" is_meta="false" speaker="Russell Roberts" start="4381">John Donvan:Russell Roberts.</p><p end="4441" is_meta="false" speaker="Russell Roberts" start="4381">--prop up the minimum wage for -- and it has a bigger effect on the people who just earned it. And that's part of the reason why Wal-Mart, which pays more than the minimum wage, favors the minimum wage, because it makes their competitors more expensive. It raises the cost to other firms that are smaller and won't -- can't afford to pay as much as Wal-Mart does. So, I agree with the questioner, though.</p><p end="4509" is_meta="false" speaker="Russell Roberts" start="4441">The level is relatively small, which means it's hard to measure. And the harm is relatively small. But as I started off by saying, for the people who can't find work, it's not small. For the people who aren't worth it, it's very tragic.</p><p end="4625" is_meta="false" speaker="Jared Bernstein" start="4564">Yeah.</p><p end="4625" is_meta="true" speaker="Jared Bernstein" start="4564">laughter</p><p end="4625" is_meta="false" speaker="Jared Bernstein" start="4564">Ad hominem attack!</p><p end="4625" is_meta="false" speaker="Jared Bernstein" start="4564">I find the other side's argument on this point just horribly muddled. I'm echoing something Karen said earlier. I just don't get it -- I'm not trying to be cute here. I really don't get the logic that says -- it certainly relates to the last question. It's really a small deal. It doesn't really affect many people. But dammit it should be abolished, because it's a big problem and it causes all this unemployment. And you&#8217;ve heard them all night,</p><p end="4625" is_meta="false" speaker="Jared Bernstein" start="4564">talk about the damaging unemployment effects of the minimum wage. Yet somehow,</p><p end="4625" is_meta="false" speaker="Jared Bernstein" start="4564">it's -- at the same time, this de minimis policy. Those both can't be right. They're logically inconsistent.</p><p end="4683" is_meta="false" speaker="Jared Bernstein" start="4625">And I think the reason -- getting to the question, and it was a good question, to me, it's Congress's way of saying, &#8220;We're not going to let the market drive wages down on our lowest-wage workers to privation-level wages. We don't want to be Hong Kong. We don't want to be Mexico. We don't want to slide down the&#8221; --</p><p end="4683" is_meta="true" speaker="Jared Bernstein" start="4625">applause</p><p end="4683" is_meta="false" speaker="Jared Bernstein" start="4625">In economics terms, we don't want to slide down the demand curve the way our opponents would like us to. Now, the reason to think that's a bad idea is if it has the negative job loss effects, if it actually distorts the economy in ways that our opponents worry about and claim.</p><p end="4683" is_meta="false" speaker="Jared Bernstein" start="4625">But research says it does not.</p><p end="4683" is_meta="false" speaker="Russell Roberts" start="4625">So horribly muddled, that's in between, I guess, nuts and unfair.</p><p end="4683" is_meta="false" speaker="Russell Roberts" start="4625">[laughter]It's not too bad. There's a subtlety here, and it's a nice rhetorical flourish here. But I think the argument is that when we say it's relatively small, we're not saying it's unimportant, we're saying it's difficult to measure.</p><p end="4744" is_meta="false" speaker="Russell Roberts" start="4683">It's difficult to tease out the independent effects when many things are happening at the same time. So as a result, when some states are doing well, they raise the minimum wage, and therefore it's hard to figure out what the independent effect is of what's going on underneath. But my question for you is, since you reject the logic that we made, and you say it's only an empirical question, I'd like to know why you think employers over the last 30 years have relentlessly punished not deliberately, but through their actions, have relentlessly punished low-skilled workers because they are relatively unattractive compared to workers outside the United States and automation.</p><p end="4744" is_meta="false" speaker="Russell Roberts" start="4683">Do you really think that work -- that employers don't respond to economic incentives?</p><p end="4744" is_meta="false" speaker="Jared Bernstein" start="4683">Employers have not consistently punished --</p><p end="4744" is_meta="false" speaker="Jared Bernstein" start="4683">Oh, sorry. Did you want --</p><p end="4744" is_meta="false" speaker="Jared Bernstein" start="4683">Sure, yeah.</p><p end="4744" is_meta="false" speaker="Jared Bernstein" start="4683">Sorry. Thank you.</p><p end="4744" is_meta="false" speaker="Jared Bernstein" start="4683">Did he say that, or I just --</p><p end="4744" is_meta="true" speaker="Jared Bernstein" start="4683">applause</p><p end="4803" is_meta="false" speaker="Jared Bernstein" start="4744">Employers have not relentlessly punished low-wage workers. In fact, in the 1990s, a period when the minimum wage was increased in 1996, the unemployment rate among low-wage workers fell to the lowest it had been in 30 years. The national unemployment rate fell below 4 percent. That was the time of welfare reform. And hundreds of thousands of low-wage, poorly-educated single moms came off welfare,</p><p end="4803" is_meta="false" speaker="Jared Bernstein" start="4744">got into the labor market. And with the complimentary boost of the minimum wage and a higher EITC, poverty rates fell very steeply. So, you know, I think you're fundamentally wrong. I'll tell you why employers fight against the minimum wage,</p><p end="4803" is_meta="false" speaker="Jared Bernstein" start="4744">because it cuts into their profits.</p><p end="4864" is_meta="false" speaker="Jared Bernstein" start="4803">For my closing statement, I'd like to get away from the dueling studies and statistics which I'm sorry we have assailed you with, and I apologize to my friends on the other side if I got a little rambunctious. I clearly feel this passionately. But I'd like to get away from that, and I'd like to bring a bunch of other people up here on the stage with me, so to speak.</p><p end="4932" is_meta="false" speaker="Jared Bernstein" start="4864">The almost 90 percent of Americans earning less than $24,000 a year who support raising the minimum wage, okay? I don't hear an argument from the other side as to why they're wrong and to why they would support, in the interests of their freedom,</p><p end="4932" is_meta="false" speaker="Jared Bernstein" start="4864">abolishing a minimum wage that 90 percent of them support. 80 percent of Americans between 18 and 30 support raising the minimum wage. Ten to one among unemployed workers support raising the minimum wage, ten to one. Now, earlier Russ said something about nobody's mind being changed. That's actually not true. It's true that a lot of people's minds don't get changed. But in fact, this research that we've been talking about, particularly these experimental designs where you can really make pretty fine granular comparisons have changed some minds. The Economist magazine now supports increasing the minimum wage. They didn't used to. Bloomberg News, Cranes New -- Cranes New York business is very much a business, a journal; the Costco CEO, the Starbucks CEO, even Mitt Romney.</p><p end="4978" is_meta="false" speaker="Jared Bernstein" start="4932">Mitt Romney, during the Republican [unintelligible] said we should index the minimum wage to inflation, not abolish it, index to -- which by the way makes sense from -- I think he was speaking like a business guy. What you don't want to see is these surprise increases along the way. You'd like to see it indexed. And that, by the way, is part of the president's proposal. So, yes, raise the minimum wage, index the minimum wage.</p><p end="4978" is_meta="false" speaker="Jared Bernstein" start="4932">Vote against -- vote no on abolishing the minimum wage. It is a cruel, far out of the mainstream idea whose time has not come and never will.</p><p end="4978" is_meta="false" speaker="Jared Bernstein" start="4932">John Donvan:Thank you, Jared Bernstein. Our motion is Abolish the minimum wage,&#8221; and here to summarize his position in support of this motion to abolish, Russell Roberts, a research fellow at the Hoover Institution.</p><p end="5046" is_meta="false" speaker="Russell Roberts" start="4978">In September of 2011, the governor of American Samoa traveled 7,000 miles to testify for five minutes in front of Congress. He begged Congress to stop increasing the minimum wage in American Samoa, a process that had begun in 2007 and was scheduled to increase until it reached the U.S. minimum of $7.25. In 2009, employment on American Samoa fell 19 percent. That's because employment in the tuna canning industry, which was a third of their jobs, had fallen 55 percent. The governor of American Samoa who came to testify blamed that collapse on the minimum wage. And here's a quote from him, his testimony, "We are watching our economy burn down. We know what to do to stop it. We need to bring the aggressive wage cost decreed by the federal government under control. Our job market is being torched, our businesses are being depressed. Our question is this: How much does our government expect us to suffer?&#8221; = have the same question for those two support the minimum wage here in the United States. How much do you expect the least skilled among us to suffer? Congress did stop increasing the minimum wage in American Samoa, thank goodness.</p><p end="5108" is_meta="false" speaker="Russell Roberts" start="5046">They should have the same compassion for workers here in the United States and abolish the minimum wage here. Right now, there are people within a few blocks of where we're sitting who cannot find work simply because their skills are not worth $7.25 an hour. Why would you condemn those men and women to a wage of zero?</p><p end="5108" is_meta="false" speaker="Russell Roberts" start="5046">Why would you cut off the bottom of the economic ladder and deprive a human being of the chance to begin a life of honest work? There are desperate people among us,</p><p end="5108" is_meta="false" speaker="Russell Roberts" start="5046">people who have nowhere to turn, whose job prospects are poor. Why make their lives worse? It's not just about the money. It's about giving people a chance to find meaning and satisfaction from standing on their own two feet. Give the least skilled among us the chance they deserve. Abolish the minimum wage.</p><p end="5167" is_meta="false" speaker="Karen Kornbluh" start="5108">Thanks so much, John. Thanks for moderating this. I want to say a few things. One,</p><p end="5167" is_meta="false" speaker="Karen Kornbluh" start="5108">abolishing the minimum wage would hurt real people and real kids. A third of those who would be hurt are parents. One-tenth are single parents. More women than men would be hurt; 55 percent of those who benefit from the minimum wage are female.</p><p end="5167" is_meta="false" speaker="Karen Kornbluh" start="5108">The average minimum wage worker contributes fully half of her or his household's entire income. Minimum wage laws do not seem to affect employment very much.</p><p end="5167" is_meta="false" speaker="Karen Kornbluh" start="5108">Studies suggest that other factors, such as the overall state of the economy, how local industries are doing, matter a lot more for employment than the level of the minimum wage does. Several states have minimum wages above the federal minimum. There are no signs that the higher rates lead to higher unemployment. Abolishing the minimum wage would hurt inequality, it would make it worse. And it would hurt social mobility.</p><p end="5167" is_meta="false" speaker="Karen Kornbluh" start="5108">It would make it harder for children of low-income families to get ahead.</p><p end="5224" is_meta="false" speaker="Karen Kornbluh" start="5167">This is very personal for me. My grandmother was a single parent. She raised four kids.</p><p end="5224" is_meta="false" speaker="Karen Kornbluh" start="5167">Fortunately, she had the minimum wage. At that point, it had become the law of the land. And she was able to send her kids to school. I'd like the single mom of today to have the opportunity to keep her family together, get her kids through school. We should restore the American dream. We should not undermine it. We should not abolish the minimum wage.</p><p end="5224" is_meta="true" speaker="Karen Kornbluh" start="5167">applause</p><p end="5472" is_meta="true" speaker="Karen Kornbluh" start="5407">inaudible</p></transcript></debate>
