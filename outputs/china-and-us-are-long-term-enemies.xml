I'd like to thank the organizers for inviting me and thank all of</p><p end="846" is_meta="false" speaker="John Mearsheimer" start="789">you folks for coming out to listen to us debate this issue tonight. Of course Peter and I</p><p end="846" is_meta="false" speaker="John Mearsheimer" start="789">are going to make the argument that China will be a long-term enemy of the United</p><p end="846" is_meta="false" speaker="John Mearsheimer" start="789">States. I want to start with two preliminary points. One is the argument here is not that</p><p end="846" is_meta="false" speaker="John Mearsheimer" start="789">we're destined to fight a war. It's that these two countries will be long-term</p><p end="846" is_meta="false" speaker="John Mearsheimer" start="789">enemies. You want to remember that during the Cold War the United States and Soviet</p><p end="846" is_meta="false" speaker="John Mearsheimer" start="789">Union were enemies, but they never fought a war thankfully, and we're not arguing that</p><p end="846" is_meta="false" speaker="John Mearsheimer" start="789">that is the case with regard to China. We're just saying they're going to be enemies.</p><p end="846" is_meta="false" speaker="John Mearsheimer" start="789">Prepared by National Capitol Contracting 200 N. Glebe Rd., #1016</p><p end="846" is_meta="false" speaker="John Mearsheimer" start="789">Arlington, VA 22203</p><p end="846" is_meta="false" speaker="John Mearsheimer" start="789">Intelligence Squared U.S. - 9 - 10/15/2015</p><p end="846" is_meta="false" speaker="John Mearsheimer" start="789">Second, when you talk about the future, there's no way you can talk about it without a</p><p end="846" is_meta="false" speaker="John Mearsheimer" start="789">theory of international politics or a theory of great power politics. And the reason is we</p><p end="846" is_meta="false" speaker="John Mearsheimer" start="789">have no evidence about the future because the evidence isn't there because the future</p><p end="846" is_meta="false" speaker="John Mearsheimer" start="789">hasn't happened yet.</p><p end="904" is_meta="false" speaker="John Mearsheimer" start="846">So you need a theory to explain what you think is going to happen and that theory, of</p><p end="904" is_meta="false" speaker="John Mearsheimer" start="846">course, has to be able to explain past cases where great powers rose and fell, and it has</p><p end="904" is_meta="false" speaker="John Mearsheimer" start="846">to be applicable to the present as well. So the division of labor between me and Peter</p><p end="904" is_meta="false" speaker="John Mearsheimer" start="846">this evening is that I'm going to lay out the simple theory that explains why China and</p><p end="904" is_meta="false" speaker="John Mearsheimer" start="846">the United States are destined to compete with each other, to have an intense security</p><p end="904" is_meta="false" speaker="John Mearsheimer" start="846">competition that involves arms races, crises, proxy wars and so forth and so on. And</p><p end="904" is_meta="false" speaker="John Mearsheimer" start="846">then what Peter's going to do when he follows me, is he's going to show you all the</p><p end="904" is_meta="false" speaker="John Mearsheimer" start="846">evidence that's already out there that supports the story that I'm going to tell you. My</p><p end="904" is_meta="false" speaker="John Mearsheimer" start="846">story basically goes like this: If you look at the international system the way it's</p><p end="904" is_meta="false" speaker="John Mearsheimer" start="846">organized, there are three characteristics of that system that force states to compete</p><p end="904" is_meta="false" speaker="John Mearsheimer" start="846">for power and to pursue greater and greater increments of power.</p><p end="963" is_meta="false" speaker="John Mearsheimer" start="904">The first characteristic of the system is that there is no higher authority that sits above</p><p end="963" is_meta="false" speaker="John Mearsheimer" start="904">states. There's no night watchman. States are like pool balls on a table. That means</p><p end="963" is_meta="false" speaker="John Mearsheimer" start="904">that if a state gets into trouble, there's nobody it can turn to rescue. As I like to say to</p><p end="963" is_meta="false" speaker="John Mearsheimer" start="904">students, "In the international system, when you dial 911, there's nobody at the other</p><p end="963" is_meta="false" speaker="John Mearsheimer" start="904">end." That means it is, in effect, a self-help system. That's characteristic</p><p end="963" is_meta="false" speaker="John Mearsheimer" start="904">one. Characteristic two is that all states have some offensive military capability, and</p><p end="963" is_meta="false" speaker="John Mearsheimer" start="904">there are invariably a few states that have a lot of offensive military capability. The</p><p end="963" is_meta="false" speaker="John Mearsheimer" start="904">third feature of the system has to do with intentions. It's almost impossible to divine</p><p end="963" is_meta="false" speaker="John Mearsheimer" start="904">the future intentions of other states because we don't even know who's going to be</p><p end="963" is_meta="false" speaker="John Mearsheimer" start="904">running China in five years or 10 years or 15 years. We don't know who's going to be</p><p end="963" is_meta="false" speaker="John Mearsheimer" start="904">running the United States in five, 10, or 15 years.</p><p end="1017" is_meta="false" speaker="John Mearsheimer" start="963">What this means is that when you operate in a world where there's no higher authority</p><p end="1017" is_meta="false" speaker="John Mearsheimer" start="963">you can turn to when you get into trouble, and you may end up next to a store -- a</p><p end="1017" is_meta="false" speaker="John Mearsheimer" start="963">country that's very powerful and has malign intentions, you quickly figure out that the</p><p end="1017" is_meta="false" speaker="John Mearsheimer" start="963">best way to survive is to be very powerful. As we used to say, when I was a young boy in</p><p end="1017" is_meta="false" speaker="John Mearsheimer" start="963">New York City playgrounds, you want to be the biggest and baddest dude on the block,</p><p end="1017" is_meta="false" speaker="John Mearsheimer" start="963">not because you're malicious or you have bad intentions, but it's the best way to</p><p end="1017" is_meta="false" speaker="John Mearsheimer" start="963">survive, because the more powerful you are, the safer you are. Now, what this means in</p><p end="1017" is_meta="false" speaker="John Mearsheimer" start="963">practical terms is that states want to, number one, dominate their region of the world,</p><p end="1017" is_meta="false" speaker="John Mearsheimer" start="963">and number two, they want to make sure they don't have a peer competitor. That</p><p end="1017" is_meta="false" speaker="John Mearsheimer" start="963">Prepared by National Capitol Contracting 200 N. Glebe Rd., #1016</p><p end="1017" is_meta="false" speaker="John Mearsheimer" start="963">Arlington, VA 22203</p><p end="1017" is_meta="false" speaker="John Mearsheimer" start="963">Intelligence Squared U.S. - 10 - 10/15/2015</p><p end="1017" is_meta="false" speaker="John Mearsheimer" start="963">means you want to make sure there's not another state in the system that dominates its</p><p end="1017" is_meta="false" speaker="John Mearsheimer" start="963">region of the world like you do.</p><p end="1082" is_meta="false" speaker="John Mearsheimer" start="1017">Let's talk a little bit about the United States. The United States is the only regional</p><p end="1082" is_meta="false" speaker="John Mearsheimer" start="1017">hegemon in modern history. Most Americans don't think about this, but the Founding</p><p end="1082" is_meta="false" speaker="John Mearsheimer" start="1017">Fathers and their successors went to enormous lengths to ensure that we would</p><p end="1082" is_meta="false" speaker="John Mearsheimer" start="1017">dominate the Western hemisphere. That involved conquering huge swaths of territory</p><p end="1082" is_meta="false" speaker="John Mearsheimer" start="1017">and making sure that the power gap between us and Mexico and us and Canada, us and</p><p end="1082" is_meta="false" speaker="John Mearsheimer" start="1017">Brazil, us and Guatemala, was enormous so that they could not cause us any</p><p end="1082" is_meta="false" speaker="John Mearsheimer" start="1017">trouble. Second thing we did was we instituted the Monroe Doctrine. We basically</p><p end="1082" is_meta="false" speaker="John Mearsheimer" start="1017">threw the European great powers out of the Western hemisphere and told them that</p><p end="1082" is_meta="false" speaker="John Mearsheimer" start="1017">they were not welcome back in here, because we did not want any distant great powers</p><p end="1082" is_meta="false" speaker="John Mearsheimer" start="1017">coming into the Western hemisphere. That was all about establishing hegemony in the</p><p end="1082" is_meta="false" speaker="John Mearsheimer" start="1017">Western hemisphere.</p><p end="1082" is_meta="false" speaker="John Mearsheimer" start="1017">Second goal, which is reflected in U.S. foreign policy in the 20th century, is to make sure</p><p end="1082" is_meta="false" speaker="John Mearsheimer" start="1017">we do not have a peer competitor. There were four potential peer competitors in the</p><p end="1082" is_meta="false" speaker="John Mearsheimer" start="1017">20th century: Imperial Germany, Imperial Japan, Nazi Germany, and the Soviet Union.</p><p end="1140" is_meta="false" speaker="John Mearsheimer" start="1082">The United States played a key role not only in making sure each one of those countries</p><p end="1140" is_meta="false" speaker="John Mearsheimer" start="1082">did not dominate either Europe or Asia, but also played a key role in putting all four of</p><p end="1140" is_meta="false" speaker="John Mearsheimer" start="1082">those countries on the scrapheap of history. The United States does not tolerate peer</p><p end="1140" is_meta="false" speaker="John Mearsheimer" start="1082">competitors. And the United States, to go back to my first point, is deeply committed to</p><p end="1140" is_meta="false" speaker="John Mearsheimer" start="1082">dominating the Western hemisphere. Now let's talk about China. As China gets more</p><p end="1140" is_meta="false" speaker="John Mearsheimer" start="1082">and more powerful -- and that's going to happen -- the question you have to ask</p><p end="1140" is_meta="false" speaker="John Mearsheimer" start="1082">yourself is what will China do with all that military power? My argument is that China</p><p end="1140" is_meta="false" speaker="John Mearsheimer" start="1082">will imitate the United States. They'd be crazy not to. They're going to try to dominate</p><p end="1140" is_meta="false" speaker="John Mearsheimer" start="1082">Asia the way we dominate the Western hemisphere. If you're in Beijing and you're a</p><p end="1140" is_meta="false" speaker="John Mearsheimer" start="1082">national security adviser, don't you want a China that is much more powerful than all its</p><p end="1140" is_meta="false" speaker="John Mearsheimer" start="1082">neighbors? The Chinese understand full well what happened the last time they were</p><p end="1140" is_meta="false" speaker="John Mearsheimer" start="1082">weak. They call it the century of national humiliation.</p><p end="1206" is_meta="false" speaker="John Mearsheimer" start="1140">They know what the Japanese, the Americans and the European great powers did to</p><p end="1206" is_meta="false" speaker="John Mearsheimer" start="1140">them, so they want to be very, very powerful, and for good reason. And they're going to</p><p end="1206" is_meta="false" speaker="John Mearsheimer" start="1140">want to push the United States out of the -- East Asia. They'd be crazy not to. As my</p><p end="1206" is_meta="false" speaker="John Mearsheimer" start="1140">mother taught me when I was a little boy, what's good for the goose is good for the</p><p end="1206" is_meta="false" speaker="John Mearsheimer" start="1140">gander. If we can have a Monroe Doctrine, why do you think they're not going to have a</p><p end="1206" is_meta="false" speaker="John Mearsheimer" start="1140">Monroe Doctrine? So China's going to try to dominate Asia. Then the question</p><p end="1206" is_meta="false" speaker="John Mearsheimer" start="1140">Prepared by National Capitol Contracting 200 N. Glebe Rd., #1016</p><p end="1206" is_meta="false" speaker="John Mearsheimer" start="1140">Arlington, VA 22203</p><p end="1206" is_meta="false" speaker="John Mearsheimer" start="1140">Intelligence Squared U.S. - 11 - 10/15/2015</p><p end="1206" is_meta="false" speaker="John Mearsheimer" start="1140">becomes, what do you think the United States is going to do? The historical record is</p><p end="1206" is_meta="false" speaker="John Mearsheimer" start="1140">very clear here. We don't tolerate peer competitors. We're not going to let them</p><p end="1206" is_meta="false" speaker="John Mearsheimer" start="1140">dominate Asia if we can prevent it. In effect, this is what the pivot to Asia is all</p><p end="1206" is_meta="false" speaker="John Mearsheimer" start="1140">about. We see them rising, and we want to maintain our dominant position in Asia.</p><p end="1206" is_meta="false" speaker="John Mearsheimer" start="1140">The end result of this is the Chinese are going to push in one direction, and we're going</p><p end="1206" is_meta="false" speaker="John Mearsheimer" start="1140">to push in the other direction, and it is going to be an intense security</p><p end="1206" is_meta="false" speaker="John Mearsheimer" start="1140">competition. Again, this is not to say we're going to have a war. But the Chinese are</p><p end="1206" is_meta="false" speaker="John Mearsheimer" start="1140">going to do this not because they have a voracious appetite for tromping on people or if</p><p end="1206" is_meta="false" speaker="John Mearsheimer" start="1140">they have a particular aggressive gene.</p><p end="1272" is_meta="false" speaker="John Mearsheimer" start="1206">It's because the best way to survive in the international system is to be a regional</p><p end="1272" is_meta="false" speaker="John Mearsheimer" start="1206">hegemon. They understand that, and at the same time we're not going to let it happen.</p><p end="1272" is_meta="false" speaker="Robert Daly" start="1206">Well, thanks to all of you for coming out tonight. Remember that our motion is that the</p><p end="1272" is_meta="false" speaker="Robert Daly" start="1206">United States and China are long-term enemies, are now and will remain enemies. The</p><p end="1272" is_meta="false" speaker="Robert Daly" start="1206">motion is not that the United States and China may become enemies in the future. Bear</p><p end="1272" is_meta="false" speaker="Robert Daly" start="1206">the wording of the motion in mind. It's very important. Our opponents' position is that</p><p end="1272" is_meta="false" speaker="Robert Daly" start="1206">the United States and China are now and have no real option except to continue to</p><p end="1272" is_meta="false" speaker="Robert Daly" start="1206">remain enemies.</p><p end="1316" is_meta="false" speaker="Robert Daly" start="1272">Why? Because a social science theory says that nations base their strategies on a</p><p end="1316" is_meta="false" speaker="Robert Daly" start="1272">survivalist ethic. Even though the question the United States and China face is not how</p><p end="1316" is_meta="false" speaker="Robert Daly" start="1272">to survive, but how to flourish. We're reduced to our basest instincts. The dire</p><p end="1316" is_meta="false" speaker="Robert Daly" start="1272">outcome that our opponents are forecasting tonight is avoidable for reasons that Kevin</p><p end="1316" is_meta="false" speaker="Robert Daly" start="1272">and I are going to spell out.

I want to emphasize from the beginning that the threat</p><p end="1446" is_meta="false" speaker="Robert Daly" start="1377">of enmity between the United States and China is real and it is not yet clear that we are</p><p end="1446" is_meta="false" speaker="Robert Daly" start="1377">going to have the wisdom to avoid this outcome. Our opponents have done a</p><p end="1446" is_meta="false" speaker="Robert Daly" start="1377">wonderful job of putting -- of raising this alarm in very stark terms. But we do have to</p><p end="1446" is_meta="false" speaker="Robert Daly" start="1377">note that we are not enemies now, despite our current concerns. The U.S. is not</p><p end="1446" is_meta="false" speaker="Robert Daly" start="1377">containing China's rise. In fact, we have promoted that rise. We have aided and</p><p end="1446" is_meta="false" speaker="Robert Daly" start="1377">abetted it. The record of engagement with China is lopsided.

In my opinion, China and the United States are strategic competitors,</p><p end="1753" is_meta="false" speaker="Peter Brookes" start="1692">they're strategic rivals, and they're even enemies.

If</p><p end="1753" is_meta="false" speaker="Peter Brookes" start="1692">you listen to the Chinese, they say that the United States is trying to &#8220;encircle&#8221; or</p><p end="1753" is_meta="false" speaker="Peter Brookes" start="1692">&#8220;contain&#8221; China, the U.S. is an &#8220;hegemon,&#8221; a dominant power, which has a very strong</p><p end="1753" is_meta="false" speaker="Peter Brookes" start="1692">negative connotation, "the U.S. wants to prevent China's rise --" this is coming out of</p><p end="1753" is_meta="false" speaker="Peter Brookes" start="1692">Beijing -- "the U.S. feels --" and you see this in commentators here in the United States --</p><p end="1753" is_meta="false" speaker="Peter Brookes" start="1692">"that China is trying to push the United States out of Asia, that China wants to replace</p><p end="1753" is_meta="false" speaker="Peter Brookes" start="1692">the United States as the preeminent power in the Pacific as the number one world</p><p end="1753" is_meta="false" speaker="Peter Brookes" start="1692">power.</p><p end="1753" is_meta="false" speaker="Peter Brookes" start="1692">Prepared by National Capitol Contracting 200 N.

It gets worse. The United States and China share important interests</p><p end="1801" is_meta="false" speaker="Peter Brookes" start="1753">in several global hotspots or flashpoints. The oldest, of course, is Taiwan, not getting a</p><p end="1801" is_meta="false" speaker="Peter Brookes" start="1753">lot of press lately, things have been quiet, but China says it's part of the People's</p><p end="1801" is_meta="false" speaker="Peter Brookes" start="1753">Republic of China. The United States says don't try to change the status quo by</p><p end="1801" is_meta="false" speaker="Peter Brookes" start="1753">force. China refuses to renounce the use of force, and the world -- the U.S. would</p><p end="1801" is_meta="false" speaker="Peter Brookes" start="1753">probably resist China trying to unify Taiwan with China using force. This is unlikely to be</p><p end="1801" is_meta="false" speaker="Peter Brookes" start="1753">resolved any time soon. It's been ongoing since 1949, and it's certainly going to remain</p><p end="1801" is_meta="false" speaker="Peter Brookes" start="1753">a point of tension between the United States and China. Another old one is the Korean</p><p end="1801" is_meta="false" speaker="Peter Brookes" start="1753">Peninsula. Most people don't think about this.</p><p end="1863" is_meta="false" speaker="Peter Brookes" start="1801">China and the United States fought there during the Korean War.

War on the Korean Peninsula, in my</p><p end="1863" is_meta="false" speaker="Peter Brookes" start="1801">estimation, is possible at any time. If you talk to U.S. forces Korea their motto is ready</p><p end="1863" is_meta="false" speaker="Peter Brookes" start="1801">to fight tonight, and that's a possibility, especially when you're dealing with the</p><p end="1863" is_meta="false" speaker="Peter Brookes" start="1801">leadership up there in North Korea. And if there is a fight there, it would likely involve</p><p end="1863" is_meta="false" speaker="Peter Brookes" start="1801">the United States and China. The most recent flashpoints are the East China Sea and the</p><p end="1863" is_meta="false" speaker="Peter Brookes" start="1801">South China Sea. Let me start with the East China Sea.</p><p end="1863" is_meta="false" speaker="Peter Brookes" start="1801">The PRC, the People's Republic of China, has a territorial dispute in the East China Sea</p><p end="1863" is_meta="false" speaker="Peter Brookes" start="1801">with American ally, Japan. The U.S. says that these islands, known in Japan as Senkaku,</p><p end="1863" is_meta="false" speaker="Peter Brookes" start="1801">known in China as the Diaoyu, or the Diaoyutai, are under "Japan's administration,"</p><p end="1863" is_meta="false" speaker="Peter Brookes" start="1801">quote unquote, and that they fall under the U.S. Japan defense treaty. That means that</p><p end="1863" is_meta="false" speaker="Peter Brookes" start="1801">the United States could intervene if China decides to aggress against these Japanese</p><p end="1863" is_meta="false" speaker="Peter Brookes" start="1801">islands.</p><p end="1928" is_meta="false" speaker="Peter Brookes" start="1863">To make this issue tenser, China has declared an air defense identification zone, an</p><p end="1928" is_meta="false" speaker="Peter Brookes" start="1863">ADIZ, over the East China Sea that includes these islands. And right afterwards, the</p><p end="1928" is_meta="false" speaker="Peter Brookes" start="1863">United States after China declared this ADIZ, the United States sent two B-52 bombers</p><p end="1928" is_meta="false" speaker="Peter Brookes" start="1863">through this ADIZ to -- as a symbol of strength that -- and to make a point to China</p><p end="1928" is_meta="false" speaker="Peter Brookes" start="1863">about their declaration.

By Beijing's measure, the</p><p end="1928" is_meta="false" speaker="Peter Brookes" start="1863">South China Sea is essentially a Chinese lake. Chinese says that the sovereignty over</p><p end="1928" is_meta="false" speaker="Peter Brookes" start="1863">that body of water and the islands in it are indisputable. To ensure this, they&#8217;re building</p><p end="1928" is_meta="false" speaker="Peter Brookes" start="1863">islands on coral reefs and rocky outcrops. On those islands they're also building ports</p><p end="1928" is_meta="false" speaker="Peter Brookes" start="1863">and air fields.

While conflict over any or all of these scenarios is</p><p end="2046" is_meta="false" speaker="Peter Brookes" start="1986">inevitable, both sides are bracing themselves for confrontation, crisis, and possibly</p><p end="2046" is_meta="false" speaker="Peter Brookes" start="1986">conflict.

The U.S. has the air/sea battle, a strategy</p><p end="2046" is_meta="false" speaker="Peter Brookes" start="1986">to defeat the anti-access aerial denial strategy, although the United States that is -- says</p><p end="2046" is_meta="false" speaker="Peter Brookes" start="1986">that isn't directed at any one country.

"Long-term enemies," that they cannot escape from this condition of</p><p end="2166" is_meta="false" speaker="Kevin Rudd" start="2112">enmity. This is extreme language. Using the term "enemy" in international relations is</p><p end="2166" is_meta="false" speaker="Kevin Rudd" start="2112">something we rarely do, but not in this proposition. It's a term we should use with</p><p end="2166" is_meta="false" speaker="Kevin Rudd" start="2112">extreme caution. Think of the definition of what an enemy is. A country you are</p><p end="2166" is_meta="false" speaker="Kevin Rudd" start="2112">fighting a war against, the soldiers, et cetera of that country.</p><p end="2213" is_meta="false" speaker="Kevin Rudd" start="2166">Let us not gloss over the gravity of the language which is being employed in this</p><p end="2213" is_meta="false" speaker="Kevin Rudd" start="2166">proposition. It's not just words. It means something much more fundamental. What</p><p end="2213" is_meta="false" speaker="Kevin Rudd" start="2166">we intend to do tonight is to defeat this proposition on three grounds. One it is</p><p end="2213" is_meta="false" speaker="Kevin Rudd" start="2166">theoretically dubious; two, practically, as Robert has just demonstrated, it does not</p><p end="2213" is_meta="false" speaker="Kevin Rudd" start="2166">reflect the current reality, in all of its dimensions and in all of its complexity of the</p><p end="2213" is_meta="false" speaker="Kevin Rudd" start="2166">current U.S.-China relationship; and three, it is dangerously determinist in the sense that</p><p end="2213" is_meta="false" speaker="Kevin Rudd" start="2166">it says to us all, we can't do anything about it. It's written in the skies. And that</p><p end="2213" is_meta="false" speaker="Kevin Rudd" start="2166">effectively is what John's theory of offensive realism says.</p><p end="2288" is_meta="false" speaker="Kevin Rudd" start="2213">John said before you needed a theory to explain what is going on because we can't</p><p end="2288" is_meta="false" speaker="Kevin Rudd" start="2213">predict the future. But then occurs the first fundamental logical step in his</p><p end="2288" is_meta="false" speaker="Kevin Rudd" start="2213">argument. That fundamental, logical step is as follows: He says that we should take,</p><p end="2288" is_meta="false" speaker="Kevin Rudd" start="2213">therefore, at face value, the proposition that a theory of international relations can be</p><p end="2288" is_meta="false" speaker="Kevin Rudd" start="2213">reliably predictive. Where is that mysteriously established? Is it written in the</p><p end="2288" is_meta="false" speaker="Kevin Rudd" start="2213">stars? No, it's not. It is simply an assertion. And in fact, if you look at the whole body of</p><p end="2288" is_meta="false" speaker="Kevin Rudd" start="2213">literature on international relations, there are as many people arguing against the</p><p end="2288" is_meta="false" speaker="Kevin Rudd" start="2213">proposition that you can be predictive about anything in the social sciences, let alone in</p><p end="2288" is_meta="false" speaker="Kevin Rudd" start="2213">politics, let alone in international relations, let alone a theory which says the United</p><p end="2288" is_meta="false" speaker="Kevin Rudd" start="2213">States and China are going to be and are now enemies. There is something that the</p><p end="2288" is_meta="false" speaker="Kevin Rudd" start="2213">scholars would describe, too, as overcoming physics envy. What do they mean by</p><p end="2288" is_meta="false" speaker="Kevin Rudd" start="2213">Prepared by National Capitol Contracting 200 N.

That there&#8217;s the hard sciences out there, the biological sciences, the physical</p><p end="2288" is_meta="false" speaker="Kevin Rudd" start="2213">sciences. They have predictive laws. We can use that method. And the social sciences</p><p end="2288" is_meta="false" speaker="Kevin Rudd" start="2213">devise the same sort of principles which can therefore predict human behavior.</p><p end="2346" is_meta="false" speaker="Kevin Rudd" start="2288">Well, pigs might fly. There is a huge body of counterevidence to that. But for this to be</p><p end="2346" is_meta="false" speaker="Kevin Rudd" start="2288">the foundational proposition of John's argument, that because he has a theory called</p><p end="2346" is_meta="false" speaker="Kevin Rudd" start="2288">offensive realism, international relations, it is, by definition, predictive of where the</p><p end="2346" is_meta="false" speaker="Kevin Rudd" start="2288">United States and China are and will be is of itself logically flawed. The second logical</p><p end="2346" is_meta="false" speaker="Kevin Rudd" start="2288">flaw in the argument is as follows: He said before that it is clear to us all that we cannot</p><p end="2346" is_meta="false" speaker="Kevin Rudd" start="2288">predict the future intentions of states. I think I've got that right, John. We cannot</p><p end="2346" is_meta="false" speaker="Kevin Rudd" start="2288">predict the future intentions of states. I then listened carefully to John list four separate</p><p end="2346" is_meta="false" speaker="Kevin Rudd" start="2288">predictions about China's attitude. China will want to demonstrate and demonstrate</p><p end="2346" is_meta="false" speaker="Kevin Rudd" start="2288">through its behavior its domination of East Asia, just like the U.S. did. That's a</p><p end="2346" is_meta="false" speaker="Kevin Rudd" start="2288">statement of intention. You then go on to say that they'll want to push the United</p><p end="2346" is_meta="false" speaker="Kevin Rudd" start="2288">States out of Asia.</p><p end="2403" is_meta="false" speaker="Kevin Rudd" start="2346">That's a statement of your conclusions about Chinese intentions. You have said they</p><p end="2403" is_meta="false" speaker="Kevin Rudd" start="2346">want to be original hegemon. That's a statement of Chinese intentions, and that we,</p><p end="2403" is_meta="false" speaker="Kevin Rudd" start="2346">the United States, won't want them to do that. That's a statement of American</p><p end="2403" is_meta="false" speaker="Kevin Rudd" start="2346">intentions. You cannot have your cake and eat it too, and say, we cannot predict a</p><p end="2403" is_meta="false" speaker="Kevin Rudd" start="2346">state's intentions and list four areas in which you are making those precise</p><p end="2403" is_meta="false" speaker="Kevin Rudd" start="2346">predictions. It's not just logically inconsistent, it's dangerous, because by being so</p><p end="2403" is_meta="false" speaker="Kevin Rudd" start="2346">predictive, it infers that conflict and war are somehow inevitable. That is not our</p><p end="2403" is_meta="false" speaker="Kevin Rudd" start="2346">proposition, not our proposition at all. I also have a theoretical premise. Some would</p><p end="2403" is_meta="false" speaker="Kevin Rudd" start="2346">say it's Marxist. Listen to this. Politics, international politics, is the art of looking for</p><p end="2403" is_meta="false" speaker="Kevin Rudd" start="2346">trouble, finding it everywhere, diagnosing it incorrectly and applying the wrong -- the</p><p end="2403" is_meta="false" speaker="Kevin Rudd" start="2346">wrong remedies, so says Groucho Marx.</p><p end="2403" is_meta="true" speaker="Kevin Rudd" start="2346">laughter</p><p end="2466" is_meta="false" speaker="Kevin Rudd" start="2403">When we look at the proposition which is before us, it is theoretically flawed. And as</p><p end="2466" is_meta="false" speaker="Kevin Rudd" start="2403">my colleague Robert has demonstrated, it doesn't bear any relationship to the complex</p><p end="2466" is_meta="false" speaker="Kevin Rudd" start="2403">reality which is unfolding in U.S.-China relations, across politics, across commerce, and</p><p end="2466" is_meta="false" speaker="Kevin Rudd" start="2403">across people-to-people engagement. But what I'm fundamentally concerned about is</p><p end="2466" is_meta="false" speaker="Kevin Rudd" start="2403">additional argument against this proposition, it is dangerously determinist. It says that</p><p end="2466" is_meta="false" speaker="Kevin Rudd" start="2403">we, through diplomacy or political leadership cannot affect an action. It is basically</p><p end="2466" is_meta="false" speaker="Kevin Rudd" start="2403">saying that international relations, we've now got the application of Calvinist</p><p end="2466" is_meta="false" speaker="Kevin Rudd" start="2403">predestination. It's all out there and we can't stop it. That's what offensive realism has</p><p end="2466" is_meta="false" speaker="Kevin Rudd" start="2403">Prepared by National Capitol Contracting 200 N. Glebe Rd., #1016</p><p end="2466" is_meta="false" speaker="Kevin Rudd" start="2403">Arlington, VA 22203</p><p end="2466" is_meta="false" speaker="Kevin Rudd" start="2403">Intelligence Squared U.S. - 19 - 10/15/2015</p><p end="2466" is_meta="false" speaker="Kevin Rudd" start="2403">as its core proposition. It's a bit like saying that Nixon and Mao had nothing to do</p><p end="2466" is_meta="false" speaker="Kevin Rudd" start="2403">through their individual diplomatic activity in changing the course of the future of U.S.-</p><p end="2466" is_meta="false" speaker="Kevin Rudd" start="2403">China relations. Well, they did through leadership. It's arguing that Deng Xiaoping had</p><p end="2466" is_meta="false" speaker="Kevin Rudd" start="2403">no impact possibly individually on China's economic future, that that was somehow</p><p end="2466" is_meta="false" speaker="Kevin Rudd" start="2403">automatically written in the stars. That's wrong.</p><p end="2529" is_meta="false" speaker="Kevin Rudd" start="2466">Individual political leaders do make a difference. And so it goes on with others who</p><p end="2529" is_meta="false" speaker="Kevin Rudd" start="2466">have contributed to the U.S.-China relationship. The point is this: There is nothing</p><p end="2529" is_meta="false" speaker="Kevin Rudd" start="2466">determinist about international relations. We decide on our futures between countries</p><p end="2529" is_meta="false" speaker="Kevin Rudd" start="2466">just as we decide upon our futures between ourselves. It is a matter of what the</p><p end="2529" is_meta="false" speaker="Kevin Rudd" start="2466">theorist would describe as human agency. We get to make the choice. And through our</p><p end="2529" is_meta="false" speaker="Kevin Rudd" start="2466">political leaders, we can choose to make a choice. An alternative approach is what I call</p><p end="2529" is_meta="false" speaker="Kevin Rudd" start="2466">constructive realism; not offensive realism, but constructive realism. Recognize the</p><p end="2529" is_meta="false" speaker="Kevin Rudd" start="2466">realist differences which exist between America and -- and China; recognize that there</p><p end="2529" is_meta="false" speaker="Kevin Rudd" start="2466">are fundamental differences in the East China Sea, the South China Sea, over Taiwan, on</p><p end="2529" is_meta="false" speaker="Kevin Rudd" start="2466">cyber, in space, on human rights, but at the same time recognize that there are multiple</p><p end="2529" is_meta="false" speaker="Kevin Rudd" start="2466">domains of constructive engagement. How do you deal conjointly with the problem of</p><p end="2529" is_meta="false" speaker="Kevin Rudd" start="2466">North Korean nuclear proliferation? How do you deal now conjointly with the problems</p><p end="2529" is_meta="false" speaker="Kevin Rudd" start="2466">of terrorism in Central Asia which afflicts China as much as anybody else?</p><p end="2589" is_meta="false" speaker="Kevin Rudd" start="2529">How do we grow the global economy through our combined growth strategies? These</p><p end="2589" is_meta="false" speaker="Kevin Rudd" start="2529">are areas of constructive engagement which can build political capital over time and</p><p end="2589" is_meta="false" speaker="Kevin Rudd" start="2529">help us deal with the fundamental problems of the future in this relationship as well.</p><p end="2757" is_meta="false" speaker="John Mearsheimer" start="2715">Yes, my three points about the structure of the system, the third point was that you</p><p end="2757" is_meta="false" speaker="John Mearsheimer" start="2715">cannot know intentions. That was a starting assumption. And what I did was I took all</p><p end="2757" is_meta="false" speaker="John Mearsheimer" start="2715">three of the assumptions and then you mix them together. And what that does is cause</p><p end="2757" is_meta="false" speaker="John Mearsheimer" start="2715">states to pursue hegemony and to prevent a peer competitor. So there's no question</p><p end="2757" is_meta="false" speaker="John Mearsheimer" start="2715">that once you mix all of the assumptions together, right, the uncertainty of that</p><p end="2757" is_meta="false" speaker="John Mearsheimer" start="2715">intentions, you do get certainty about intentions in that states do pursue hegemony.</p><p end="2757" is_meta="false" speaker="Kevin Rudd" start="2715">I certainly don't.</p><p end="2831" is_meta="false" speaker="Kevin Rudd" start="2757">You cannot on the one hand provide a theory which seeks to be descriptive of a current</p><p end="2831" is_meta="false" speaker="Kevin Rudd" start="2757">reality normative about what that future reality might be and at the same time suggest</p><p end="2831" is_meta="false" speaker="Kevin Rudd" start="2757">that you're not providing a description of predictive intent on the part of the other</p><p end="2831" is_meta="false" speaker="Kevin Rudd" start="2757">country and then walk away from describing the fact that, that is their predictive intent.</p><p end="2831" is_meta="false" speaker="Kevin Rudd" start="2757">It is either determinist, which it is, of the level of determinism, which Georg Friedrich</p><p end="2831" is_meta="false" speaker="Kevin Rudd" start="2757">Hegel would be embarrassed, or it leaves an option for diplomacy and what we call</p><p end="2831" is_meta="false" speaker="Kevin Rudd" start="2757">"human agency." And if I've read John's theories carefully about offensive realism, it</p><p end="2831" is_meta="false" speaker="Kevin Rudd" start="2757">provides little if any opportunity for human agency to say, "Let's negotiate our way</p><p end="2831" is_meta="false" speaker="Kevin Rudd" start="2757">through."</p><p end="2831" is_meta="false" speaker="John Mearsheimer" start="2757">I don't --</p><p end="2831" is_meta="false" speaker="John Mearsheimer" start="2757">-- I think the theory is deterministic. I think that's a legitimate criticism. I think my</p><p end="2831" is_meta="false" speaker="John Mearsheimer" start="2757">response to John's question about intentions clears that up. I don't think the intentions</p><p end="2831" is_meta="false" speaker="John Mearsheimer" start="2757">issue is a real issue. But the point about determinism is correct. John is -- I mean, Kevin</p><p end="2831" is_meta="false" speaker="John Mearsheimer" start="2757">is saying there's hardly any agency in my story, individuals don't matter, there's no</p><p end="2831" is_meta="false" speaker="John Mearsheimer" start="2757">possibility for managing this so it ends happily. He's correct in that regard.</p><p end="2889" is_meta="false" speaker="Robert Daly" start="2831">It means that it is bound to happen.</p><p end="2889" is_meta="false" speaker="Robert Daly" start="2831">It's inevitable.

The United</p><p end="3186" is_meta="false" speaker="Robert Daly" start="3121">States gives more money to U.N. peace-keeping missions than any other country.

A</p><p end="3306" is_meta="false" speaker="Kevin Rudd" start="3248">European Union was built.

The</p><p end="3483" is_meta="false" speaker="Peter Brookes" start="3418">United States is a Pacific nation.

We have five sets of</p><p end="3483" is_meta="false" speaker="Peter Brookes" start="3418">allies -- in the Pacific theater. We have defense and security commitments. As I</p><p end="3483" is_meta="false" speaker="Peter Brookes" start="3418">mentioned, $1.2 trillion in trade goes through the South China Sea. So I think the United</p><p end="3483" is_meta="false" speaker="Peter Brookes" start="3418">States is trying to protect its interests, meet its obligations. Of course, putting into play</p><p end="3483" is_meta="false" speaker="Peter Brookes" start="3418">human agency, the United States could move away from those commitments.

The state visit of Xi Jinping just recently to the United States was a very tense</p><p end="3792" is_meta="false" speaker="Peter Brookes" start="3732">relationship, very tense meeting.

When we</p><p end="3912" is_meta="false" speaker="John Mearsheimer" start="3848">expanded NATO and the EU eastward, we thought that international politics had</p><p end="3912" is_meta="false" speaker="John Mearsheimer" start="3848">changed, that realpolitik was finished and we could get away with expanding NATO and</p><p end="3912" is_meta="false" speaker="John Mearsheimer" start="3848">the EU, and it would have no consequences. We found out exactly the opposite was the</p><p end="3912" is_meta="false" speaker="John Mearsheimer" start="3848">case, because Putin is a first-class realpolitiker. The same thing applies to East</p><p end="3912" is_meta="false" speaker="John Mearsheimer" start="3848">Asia. There's all sorts of evidence out there that the Chinese think in realpolitik</p><p end="3912" is_meta="false" speaker="John Mearsheimer" start="3848">terms. And if you look at the competition that's beginning to brew, it runs against the</p><p end="3912" is_meta="false" speaker="John Mearsheimer" start="3848">argument that international politics has changed. Look at the Middle East today. It's</p><p end="3912" is_meta="false" speaker="John Mearsheimer" start="3848">hard to believe that all these new theories that were put on the table when the Cold</p><p end="3912" is_meta="false" speaker="John Mearsheimer" start="3848">War ended apply there.

We</p><p end="3963" is_meta="false" speaker="Robert Daly" start="3912">see Vietnam, Singapore, Malaysia.
