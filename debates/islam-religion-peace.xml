I want to express my deepest gratitude to Mr. Rosenkranz and the Intelligence Squared forum for allowing me to speak tonight alongside such well-known and far more distinguished co-panelists. This is particularly an honor for me because,</p><p end="399" is_meta="false" speaker="Zeba Khan" start="270">let&#8217;s be honest, I haven&#8217;t written a book, I&#8217;m not a regular on national T.V. or radio. What I have is my story.</p><p end="399" is_meta="false" speaker="Zeba Khan" start="270">I am a Muslim American woman born and raised in Toledo, Ohio by two very loving Indian Muslim parents. My sister, brother, and I were raised in a middle-class American home. We went to Mosque on Sundays, attended Sunday school classes, and prayed the community prayer with our community of Pakistanis, Lebanese, and Syrian Muslims.</p><p end="399" is_meta="false" speaker="Zeba Khan" start="270">When I was in high school, our Mosque president was a woman, who did not wear a headscarf. And it may come as a surprise to some of you, but for the entirety of my life men and women have prayed side by side at our Mosque, and both can enter the prayer hall using the same door.</p><p end="399" is_meta="false" speaker="Zeba Khan" start="270">My parents are both very religious people, but they express their faith in different ways.</p><p end="399" is_meta="false" speaker="Zeba Khan" start="270">My father emphasizes the devotional, and he tends to spend his time praying and reciting the Koran, whereas my mother emphasized the more constructive approach.</p><p end="508" is_meta="false" speaker="Zeba Khan" start="399">She uses community service and volunteering to express hers. But what they both share is fundamental Islamic principles. First and foremost, seek knowledge. They urged their children, all three of us, to question, to have critical minds, and to doubt. They wanted usto engage fully with our faith and to question everything. They lived out the Koranic commandments that there is no compulsion in religion, and also that God said, in the Koran, &#8220;I made you into many tribes so that you might know one another.&#8221; And as such,</p><p end="508" is_meta="false" speaker="Zeba Khan" start="399">they enrolled me and my siblings in a Hebrew day school for nine years, where we learned Hebrew, read the Torah, and prayed in a synagogue almost every morning. They always wanted us to learn about other faiths, and they always made sure that we knew the difference, though, between Islam and Judaism. But they also made sure we also respected our Jewish sisters and brothers in faith.</p><p end="508" is_meta="false" speaker="Zeba Khan" start="399">My story is just one of 1.5 billion stories in some 57 countries. The Muslim population is one of the most diverse and eclectic in the world. We are Sunnis, we are Shias, and even in the Shia tradition there are Zaidis, Ismailis, Ismasheries [spelled phonetically]. There are numerous madhhabs, or schools of thought, and Sufi mystic orders. Like Christians and Jews, Muslims can be observant, nonobservant, performist, humanist, secularist,</p><p end="508" is_meta="false" speaker="Zeba Khan" start="399">extremist, mainstream, and there are even some Muslims who consider themselves culturally Muslims but are actually atheists.</p><p end="632" is_meta="false" speaker="Zeba Khan" start="508">Now, the motion before you tonight is asking you to determine whether Islam is a religion of peace. And at first blush, that might seem a bit tricky to decide. After all, the Koran and the Hadith have verses in them that point to peace and justice and love. But there are other verses that are violent, are about violence and about violence against specific people. So how then do we reconcile these seemingly contradictory verses?</p><p end="632" is_meta="false" speaker="Zeba Khan" start="508">How then do we decide whether Islam is a religion of peace? The only way to answer that question is to take an honest look at the people who practice the faith and how they interpret it. According to Gallup's ground breaking study on what a billion Muslims think, 93 percent of Muslims around the world are peaceful, mainstream Muslims. Seven percent are what Gallup determines as politically radicalized. And within that seven percent, there's a smaller percent that has succumbed to the use of violence. Any percent is too much. But we must remember that the violent minority of a minority are motivated by politics, not religion. As Gallup concluded, what distinguishes the politically radicalized Muslims from the mainstream Muslims is their politics, not their piety.</p><p end="632" is_meta="false" speaker="Zeba Khan" start="508">Robert Pape, a University of Chicago political scientist, further confirmed this in his book, Dying to Win, in which he came to the same conclusion, that the actions of terrorists are politically motivated, not through religion. The Tamil Tigers, for example,</p><p end="632" is_meta="false" speaker="Zeba Khan" start="508">which are predominantly a Hindu group, used and pioneered the use of suicide bombing,</p><p end="632" is_meta="false" speaker="Zeba Khan" start="508">did so far secessionist reasons, not for religious goals.</p><p end="632" is_meta="false" speaker="Zeba Khan" start="508">Our opponents would have you believe that there is a take all, no winner clash between Islam and the West, and that Muslims who try to balance their Western values and Islam arrive at a state of cognitive dissonance and are left either mute or crazy by this internal struggle.</p><p end="753" is_meta="false" speaker="Zeba Khan" start="632">That distribution description doesn't resonate for me or for my family or for my friends or for my community, because those two aspects of our identity were never in conflict with each other and were never introduced to us as in conflict with each other. I didn't realize that there were people out there who wondered whether people -- Muslims like me existed or could exist until after 9/11.</p><p end="753" is_meta="false" speaker="Zeba Khan" start="632">Let me be clear. There are some horrifically violent criminals out there who twist our faith to justify their hate and their violence. But I am here to tell you they don't speak for Islam. Mohammad Hamdani [spelled phonetically], a first responder who died on 9/11,</p><p end="753" is_meta="false" speaker="Zeba Khan" start="632">speaks for Islam. Hassan Askari, a Brooklyn Muslim who stepped in on the subway and saved a complete stranger who was being physically attacked because he was Jewish, he speaks for Islam. Zainab Salbi, through her organization Women for Women International, has assisted forever a quarter of a million women across the world. She speaks for Islam. And the entire Muslim community of India, who, when the authorities asked them to take the militants who attacked Mumbai in 2008, said resoundingly and collectively no. We will not let the terrorists be buried with us.</p><p end="753" is_meta="false" speaker="Zeba Khan" start="632">The media and those who profit from the narrative of Islam versus the West are never going to tell you my story or the stories of these Muslims who constitute the vast majority of Muslims around the world. But just because you may not hear us, it doesn't mean we're not speaking out. And just because you may not see us on TV, it doesn't mean we don't exist. If you vote against the motion, I would argue you're voting against the moderate voices of mainstream Islam and telling the terrorists that you agree with their version. I urge to you vote for the motion. Thank you.</p><p end="871" is_meta="false" speaker="Ayaan Hirsi Ali" start="753">Well, because I had to live with -- basically, I was afraid for my life.</p><p end="871" is_meta="false" speaker="Ayaan Hirsi Ali" start="753">In the 21st Century, in a free country.</p><p end="871" is_meta="false" speaker="Ayaan Hirsi Ali" start="753">Ladies and gentlemen, I am surprised by the motion itself. When I first heard it, it reminded me of the academic question, how many angels can dance on the head of a pin?</p><p end="871" is_meta="false" speaker="Ayaan Hirsi Ali" start="753">And I think, well, if you do the salsa or the cha cha, not many. Why are we not having a motion on is Christianity a religion of peace, is Judaism a religion of peace, et cetera?</p><p end="871" is_meta="false" speaker="Ayaan Hirsi Ali" start="753">Because those would be academic motions. Unfortunately, the motion, &#8220;Islam is a religion of peace&#8221; is not academic.</p><p end="871" is_meta="false" speaker="Ayaan Hirsi Ali" start="753">I respect and admire Zeba Khan. And I want to acknowledge the fact that you indeed are a demonstration of the assimilation of a Muslim individual, a Muslim woman into Western society, into an American society. But you come from a middle class family that was very eclectic and respected pluralism. I respect that very much, and I admire you for it. And I think you are an example to others.</p><p end="996" is_meta="false" speaker="Ayaan Hirsi Ali" start="871">However, I disagree with you that you represent Islam or that you speak for Islam. The problem that is inherent in Islam from the time of its foundation up to this moment is who speaks for Islam. And I&#8217;ll get to that later on. Is it Zeba Khan or is it Faisal Shahzad?</p><p end="996" is_meta="false" speaker="Ayaan Hirsi Ali" start="871">He was also a middle class man, went to business school, married an American woman,</p><p end="996" is_meta="false" speaker="Ayaan Hirsi Ali" start="871">had two children, lived just like you, like many of you. And yet, he made a different choice based on a combination of piety and politics. And that's what Islam is.</p><p end="996" is_meta="false" speaker="Ayaan Hirsi Ali" start="871">And before I go on, let me define the key terms of the motion. First, religion. The most common definition of religion you will find is the universal quest of humans in search --</p><p end="996" is_meta="false" speaker="Ayaan Hirsi Ali" start="871">in search of the sacred or the holy. That search is expressed intellectually. It's expressed in practice. It is expressed in fellowship. And you look at the religion like Islam, on an intellectual level it was expressed by the founder of Islam as a demolition of all other gods. Polytheism had to end, and all humanity had to be united under one God. From those of you who are familiar with history, and I think a crowd like this is, you know that no monotheistic religion can be a religion of peace. No monotheistic religion is a religion of peace, and definitely not Islam. Monotheistic religions know periods, lengthy periods of peace, but they also know lengthy periods of war.</p><p end="1119" is_meta="false" speaker="Ayaan Hirsi Ali" start="996">In times of practice, yes, in Islam, you practice charity, you go to Hajj, you pray, all of that. But in terms of practice, there is also the expression, there is the concept of jihad.And I find it a pity that Zeba Khan did not mention that concept, which is central to Islam's conquests and Islam's success. The founder of Islam, Mohammad, in his lifetime,</p><p end="1119" is_meta="false" speaker="Ayaan Hirsi Ali" start="996">conducted 65 campaigns of war that were all successful. And that militaristic history of Islam is well documented. Just go Google it. And if you don't find it on Google, go to all those former empires that were conquered.</p><p end="1119" is_meta="false" speaker="Ayaan Hirsi Ali" start="996">The combination of a history of empire, of conquest, also leaves a legacy behind. And that legacy is the thrusting together of people of different ethnicities, languages, et cetera.</p><p end="1119" is_meta="false" speaker="Ayaan Hirsi Ali" start="996">So even if that empire declines, the likelihood, the likelihood of conflict, of war, is probable. It's high, especially where there is a fault line. That's where Samuel Huntington had a point. That history of militarism, combined with the legacy of empire,</p><p end="1119" is_meta="false" speaker="Ayaan Hirsi Ali" start="996">those two points alone belie the motion tonight, that Islam is a religion of peace, but that's not all. When empires decline, those who are defeated, and the Muslim Empire declined,</p><p end="1119" is_meta="false" speaker="Ayaan Hirsi Ali" start="996">those who are defeated sometimes themselves in a state of victimhood. That state of victimhood is exploited by the leadership or the self-appointed leaders of Islam. And what do you see? You see a number of people, and I concede it's a minority, who believe that Islam is under siege.</p><p end="1235" is_meta="false" speaker="Ayaan Hirsi Ali" start="1119">A mentality of victimhood tells those who are conquered, who are vanquished, that the problem was caused by external powers, not by us, and that systematic denial within Islam after the 19th Century to blame only outsiders exempts Islam from blame, from the explanation what went wrong. Yes, it was external, yes, Muslims were humiliated, yes,</p><p end="1235" is_meta="false" speaker="Ayaan Hirsi Ali" start="1119">they were conquered, yes, they were colonized, but how much was also because of the flaws of Islam?</p><p end="1235" is_meta="false" speaker="Ayaan Hirsi Ali" start="1119">And that takes me to the point of absolutism. When the West went into its scientific revolution, why wasn't it Muslims? Muslims were the first scientists, arithmetic, logic, et cetera. They were great; why didn't they get into that scientific revolution? Why were they left behind? Was it only because of external factors or were there internal flaws?</p><p end="1235" is_meta="false" speaker="Ayaan Hirsi Ali" start="1119">That combination of a status of victimhood and the absolutism -- the demand that you can never revise or reflect on the Koran, that you can never, never ever refute what Mohammad said, you can only follow his example -- that absolutism combined with that status of victimhood also enlarges the likelihood of conflict, and those two combined like the other two factors like --</p><p end="1352" is_meta="false" speaker="Maajid Nawaz" start="1235">In one sentence.</p><p end="1352" is_meta="true" speaker="Maajid Nawaz" start="1235">laughter</p><p end="1352" is_meta="false" speaker="Maajid Nawaz" start="1235">You're talking about four years now.</p><p end="1352" is_meta="false" speaker="Maajid Nawaz" start="1235">Amnesty International. Well, I'll explain that and hopefully [unintelligible].</p><p end="1352" is_meta="false" speaker="Maajid Nawaz" start="1235">Thank you.</p><p end="1352" is_meta="false" speaker="Maajid Nawaz" start="1235">[applause]Can I indulge the audience and just ask for a round of applause for Zeba's mom, she's just over there, I think she did a wonderful job.</p><p end="1352" is_meta="true" speaker="Maajid Nawaz" start="1235">applause</p><p end="1352" is_meta="false" speaker="Maajid Nawaz" start="1235">To raise your daughter to speak Hebrew in the current climate is amazing and I applaud you.</p><p end="1352" is_meta="false" speaker="Maajid Nawaz" start="1235">So, ladies and gentlemen, thank you for giving me this opportunity. I want to begin by just stating what this debate is not about. This debate is not about making excuses for terrorism. Basically my career is to challenge extremism and terrorism in the West and also in Muslim majority countries. I've just flown right in from Pakistan where I've been building the foundations for the first nationwide social movement to challenge extremism and promote democratic values in Pakistan. And I'm proud to announce that just today we gained our 10,000th member on Facebook. So this debate --</p><p end="1352" is_meta="true" speaker="Maajid Nawaz" start="1235">laughter</p><p end="1352" is_meta="false" speaker="Maajid Nawaz" start="1235">-- this debate is not about making excuses for suicide bombers even inside Israel. We make no apologies and no excuses on this panel for terrorism, for extremism, and for people who kill innocent civilians, including inside Israel.</p><p end="1480" is_meta="false" speaker="Maajid Nawaz" start="1352">This debate acknowledges, we, on our panel, Zeba and myself, acknowledge that Muslims do need to speak out against extremism and to challenge it, and more Muslims need to do that more actively. We acknowledge that Muslims bear responsibility in reclaiming their faith from those -- the minority who have hijacked Islam and who have captured the public imagination in their definition of Islam. We acknowledge that, and I am in my own person a manifestation of that effort, as is Zeba in the way she was raised.</p><p end="1480" is_meta="false" speaker="Maajid Nawaz" start="1352">So we acknowledge that as well. This debate, in fact, is an appeal. It&#8217;s not -- also, before I move to the fact that it&#8217;s an appeal, it&#8217;s also not a threat. So, we&#8217;re not going to argue here tonight that if you don&#8217;t vote for the motion, that somehow Muslims are going to rise up and attack you for insulting Islam.</p><p end="1480" is_meta="true" speaker="Maajid Nawaz" start="1352">laughter</p><p end="1480" is_meta="false" speaker="Maajid Nawaz" start="1352">That&#8217;s not the case. This is an appeal. And it&#8217;s an appeal to your good sense and your good character and to what you know inside you. This is not a debate for Islam at all.</p><p end="1480" is_meta="false" speaker="Maajid Nawaz" start="1352">This is a debate for peace. And we are not arguing for Islamic peace; we&#8217;re arguing for Islam to be -- with all other religions and beliefs and those that have no faith -- to be part of the effort to create peace in the world. So this is a debate for peace. It&#8217;s a debate, and I&#8217;m asking you all to vote tonight not for Islam, but to vote for peace and to help contribute the efforts of all of us around the world who are working for peace.Because there are people like me who spent 13 years of our lives working to create hatred. I used to believe that Islam is not a religion of peace. In fact, I used to believe that Islam mandates war. I used to believe and propagate across the world in more than three countries that Islam mandates war and mandates the creation of a state that will have at its heart of its foreign policy a policy to create conquest. I called it jihad. I believed that Islam was not a religion of peace because I adopted an ideology at 16 years old and stuck with that until my imprisonment and after I was released from prison when I was 28 years old.</p><p end="1595" is_meta="false" speaker="Maajid Nawaz" start="1480">By that time I had established this ideology in Pakistan and in Denmark and contributed to its growth in Egypt.</p><p end="1595" is_meta="false" speaker="Maajid Nawaz" start="1480">But I learned in prison two things. One was what I&#8217;m appealing to you today and that was when people hold out an olive branch, it does work. People I&#8217;d considered my enemy, people I&#8217;d considered the enemy of my people, Amnesty International with their advocation of human rights that I believed was a tool to colonize the minds of Muslims,</p><p end="1595" is_meta="false" speaker="Maajid Nawaz" start="1480">adopted me as a prisoner of conscience. And by handing me that olive branch, I recognized that there was goodness in the world and there were people who, regardless of the provocation they find in the world today, are still willing to fight for peace and are still willing to redefine the debate.</p><p end="1595" is_meta="false" speaker="Maajid Nawaz" start="1480">And that&#8217;s what I&#8217;m asking you to do here tonight. Because by redefining the debate, and by insisting that they would not allow my hatred to define for them the way in which they viewed me, they changed my heart. I went on and took that message forward and helped establish the world&#8217;s first counter-extremism think tank in the West, then went into Pakistan to establish the first nationwide counter-extremism movement in Pakistan. And as I said, we had 10,000 supporters before we&#8217;d even launched, of Muslims in Pakistan who are helping us to redefine the debate, who are not allowing the minority of extremists to hijack Islam, to monopolize its definition, and then define for us all that this should be a world of war, not just Islam as a religion of war, but as you heard from our co-panelists on the other side, all religions should be religions of war in their minds.</p><p end="1595" is_meta="false" speaker="Maajid Nawaz" start="1480">Whether that&#8217;s because they want to fight or because they don&#8217;t believe in religions and they wish to challenge religions from that basis. And so I make an appeal to all of you tonight to help us redefine this debate.</p><p end="1711" is_meta="false" speaker="Maajid Nawaz" start="1595">And the second thing that happened to me in prison that helped me change my mind was that I had the opportunity -- I won&#8217;t say good fortune because it wasn&#8217;t really that -- but the opportunity to mix with some of the leading founding jihadists of the world inside an Egyptian prison, ironically built by the British. And what I learned was that I had been extremely arrogant. I had suffered from the failure that I saw here tonight in my respected colleagues&#8217; presentation. I had failed to contextualize history, and when I was this young and angry 24-year-old who, yes, had grievances, who&#8217;d been stabbed atmultiple times growing up on the streets of Essex, who had been falsely arrested on a number of occasions because of racial profiling -- I was a very angry young man. But I went to men in prison, who had been in prison since I was three years old, and then I met them at 24, and they had abandoned their previous terrorist ideologies and I had the arrogance to try and convince them that they had sold out, that they didn&#8217;t understand that true Islam was a religion of war. And they said to me, &#8220;Young lad, come and sit down.</p><p end="1711" is_meta="false" speaker="Maajid Nawaz" start="1595">We&#8217;ll tell you a story or two.&#8221;</p><p end="1711" is_meta="false" speaker="Maajid Nawaz" start="1595">And over the course of the four years, after having learned Arabic, after having memorized half of the Koran, after having studied the theology, though myself not being too much of a religious man, I came to the conclusion that Islam had been hijacked and abused and politicized by something that I now refer to as Islamism, the modern ideology that owes more to post World War I European fascism than it does to the traditions of Islam. And these former jihadists, among them the assassins of Egypt's former president,</p><p end="1711" is_meta="false" speaker="Maajid Nawaz" start="1595">Anwar Sadat, who was killed in 1981, they had come to the same conclusions.</p><p end="1834" is_meta="false" speaker="Maajid Nawaz" start="1711">And so I appeal to all of you as my time runs out -- there is much more to say -- to vote to help us all to redefine this motion, to redefine this world, because only by refusing to accept the paradigms that we find imposed upon us can we refute change. And that's exactly how the civil rights movement in America tackled this issue when they were faced with such situations in the past. Thank you for your patience, and thank you for your time.</p><p end="1834" is_meta="true" speaker="Maajid Nawaz" start="1711">applause</p><p end="1834" is_meta="false" speaker="Douglas Murray" start="1711">That's right. I said Mohammad made me an atheist. The publisher said at the time that it's a pretty provocative headline. I said, &#8220;Well, get somebody to do the next one.&#8221; She said, &#8220;I could find a Catholic who could say Mohammad made me a Catholic.&#8221; I said,</p><p end="1834" is_meta="false" speaker="Douglas Murray" start="1711">&#8220;How about trying to make a three-part article and get a third one of somebody saying Mohammad made me a Jew.&#8221; And that one would be the trouble.</p><p end="1834" is_meta="false" speaker="Douglas Murray" start="1711">Well, thank you. Thank you. It's a great pleasure to be here tonight. I'm sorry to make this panel rather Brit-centric after my colleague Maajid. It isn't an attempt by us to have a British takeover of the old colony or anything like that.</p><p end="1834" is_meta="true" speaker="Douglas Murray" start="1711">laughter</p><p end="1834" is_meta="false" speaker="Douglas Murray" start="1711">But I was coming earlier from my own fallen empire, going back to my friend and colleague Ayaan's comments earlier. And I was reading the paper, as I'm sure all of you were doing all yesterday. Maajid finished his comments by talking about the importance of changing paradigms. I'm not sure it is about paradigms. I think it's about facts. Here are some facts. In my newspaper earlier, the Times Square Bomber, of course, a man just up the road from here, who tried to kill thousands of people, only, by the way, didn't manage it because he set the 24-hour timing device at 7:00 a.m. instead of 7:00 p.m.,</p><p end="1834" is_meta="false" speaker="Douglas Murray" start="1711">1900 hours was what it was meant to be.</p><p end="1953" is_meta="false" speaker="Douglas Murray" start="1834">If he had to have got that bit right, thousands of New Yorkers would have died earlier this year, again. I see further in the paper 12 suspects arrested in France in a network trying to recruit people to go in to fight American and other troops in Afghanistan. I turn to another page of the newspaper, in the city I had just flown off from this morning, a Muslim London Underground worker who was -- had written to his wife who was off to -</p><p end="1953" is_meta="false" speaker="Douglas Murray" start="1834">- tried to become a martyr for Allah, as he said. He said, &#8220;More than anything I wish Allah to grant me martyrdom." Ladies and gentlemen, we have to look at facts. We should also, just quickly -- if I may refer something to the wording of tonight's debate,</p><p end="1953" is_meta="false" speaker="Douglas Murray" start="1834">Ayaan's already mentioned it. But let me put it this way. You're, I'm sure, a liberal minded New York audience. At least I hope you are. We will see.</p><p end="1953" is_meta="false" speaker="Douglas Murray" start="1834">But I imagine that if the motion we had here tonight was &#8220;Christianity is a religion of peace,&#8221; we get to the Q and A, perhaps even before, and somebody would say if the other side were arguing for that, somebody would say, "What about the crusades, hmm? What about that?" Then there'd be some other Clever Clarks who'd say, &#8220;I -- what about that Florida pastor the other week? There was a nasty business. That's Christianity for you.&#8221;</p><p end="1953" is_meta="false" speaker="Douglas Murray" start="1834">If we'd have had tonight Judaism is a religion of peace, the other side would try to argue that. Sure as anything, there'd be people popping up in the hall tonight saying, &#8220;Oh,</p><p end="1953" is_meta="false" speaker="Douglas Murray" start="1834">there's this bit in one of the Old Testament books, really, really bad, all sorts of massacres going on. Why don't you talk about that?&#8221; There might even be people trying to say that religion -- the argument that Judaism was a religion of peace couldn't be argued because people would say look at what Israel is doing. And isn't that a direct [unintelligible], and so on.</p><p end="1953" is_meta="false" speaker="Douglas Murray" start="1834">So let's not have a debate about Islam and whether or not Islam is a religion of peace without talking about the facts to do with Islam. It's an absurd situation we're in, where nothing that anyone does whilst being Muslim is any responsibility of Islam.</p><p end="2072" is_meta="false" speaker="Douglas Murray" start="1953">Yet anything anyone does whilst being a Christian or a Jew is the responsibility of all Christians, all Jews. Let's make this as straightforward as I can. Take the categorization that eminent scholars like Bernard Lewis and Ibn Warraq have made. Let's say Islam is a very, very complex thing. And the best way I can do this in the very short time I have, is say you have three Islams, Islam one, two, and three. Islam one, the Koran and the life of Mohammad and the Hadith. Islam two, the tradition of the Sharia. Islam three, what Muslims do now. The first of those things, Islam, the Koran and so on, is bad. It is bad.</p><p end="2072" is_meta="false" speaker="Douglas Murray" start="1953">There is a lot of violence in it. And what's worse, the peaceful verses are superseded by the violent verses. The violent verses also sadly are more numerous in number. Then you've got the life of Mohammad. Again, a bad man, a very bad man. It happens to be that not a great role model if you look at it. Takes child brides, abuses a small girl,</p><p end="2072" is_meta="false" speaker="Douglas Murray" start="1953">multiple wives, himself a warrior, himself a war criminal, himself beheads Jews. This, I would have thought, would be a signal of not great peacefulness.</p><p end="2072" is_meta="false" speaker="Douglas Murray" start="1953">Then you've got the tradition of the Sharia, again, not great peacefulness, still no schools of Sharia that people in this hall would want to submit to.</p><p end="2072" is_meta="false" speaker="Douglas Murray" start="1953">And thirdly, what Muslims do now. Thankfully, there is some hope in that one, because most Muslims, thank goodness -- I almost said thank God, but -- old habits die-hard.</p><p end="2072" is_meta="false" speaker="Douglas Murray" start="1953">Most Muslims don't do what those texts say because they exercise their judgment as moral beings without having to refer to defunct holy books.</p><p end="2072" is_meta="false" speaker="Douglas Murray" start="1953">Now, look, I wish that Zeba and Maajid were the spokespeople of Islam. It would be lovely. Although in Maajid's case, it would have taken rather too long if everyone had to go 14 years of preaching the downfall of America and then said no, not so much.</p><p end="2195" is_meta="true" speaker="Douglas Murray" start="2072">laughter</p><p end="2195" is_meta="false" speaker="Douglas Murray" start="2072">But we are where we are. Anyhow, I wish they spoke for Islam. It would be great. But the fact is that tonight, the organizers of this debate asked a number of clerics, none of them which showed, specifically they wouldn't show and debate against Ayaan Hirsi Ali.</p><p end="2195" is_meta="false" speaker="Douglas Murray" start="2072">Myself, I don't think they cared. But no, it's very interesting. They will not debate. Time and again, Muslims -- the actual leaders of your religion will not debate this. And you are left with people -- now here, the reasons why of course is the leaders of the religion show such terrible -- terrible lessons. It is not a small thing. It's not as if it were a detail.</p><p end="2195" is_meta="false" speaker="Douglas Murray" start="2072">It's not like a wacky Florida pastor. But you've got the largest Sunni state of Saudi Arabia, the most important Sunni state in the world, the most extraordinary closed prison of a society. It's not a detail. It's not a one-off nut job. The Shiite republic of Iran is what it is, led by the people it's led by. That is not an accident. It's not a detail.</p><p end="2195" is_meta="false" speaker="Douglas Murray" start="2072">The thing that worries me is that although tonight we hear from the panelists here about how Islam is a religion of peace, the fact is that the people who are making the decisionsin the religion, the people who are preaching the religion, the heads of that religion,</p><p end="2195" is_meta="false" speaker="Douglas Murray" start="2072">people like Sheikh Qaradawi who broadcasts anti-Semitic -- the most appalling filth every week on the main network, that is the faith that is speaking for you guys. I wish that Zeba, you were on every week on Al Jazeera, but you are not. Qaradawi is. The problem is that Islam is an unstable component, as a religion, an unstable component. A thousand years ago, the Mustabalites [spelled phonetically] tried to reform the religion.</p><p end="2195" is_meta="false" speaker="Douglas Murray" start="2072">They were wiped out. The fact is that Islam is many things, many, many things. But to say it's a religion of peace is nonsense. It's to ignore reality. It's to ignore very difficult but necessary facts, not paradigms, but facts.</p><p end="2310" is_meta="false" speaker="Douglas Murray" start="2195">To say that Islam is a religion of peace is to say something based entirely on hope. It's to elevate a hope into truth. And I hope, as you will note, history teaches us that's a very bad thing to do. Thank you.</p><p end="2310" is_meta="true" speaker="Douglas Murray" start="2195">applause</p><p end="2310" is_meta="false" speaker="Ayaan Hirsi Ali" start="2195">Well, my parents and people like my respectful opponents here are ignoring the basic tenets of their religion.</p><p end="2429" is_meta="false" speaker="Ayaan Hirsi Ali" start="2310">When Mohammad, the founder of the religion, called out to all Muslims -- and that's how he won most of his wars, by saying, "I have been ordered and all believing men have been ordered to attack and kill and maim anyone unless they testify, unless all men testify to the fact that Allah is the one and only, Mohammad is his messenger, my father disobeys that. Well, Maajid Nawaz tried to obey that first and then stopped obeying it.</p><p end="2429" is_meta="false" speaker="Ayaan Hirsi Ali" start="2310">But the fact that that scripture is there and that history of militarism is there belies the motion that Islam is a religion of peace.</p><p end="2429" is_meta="false" speaker="Ayaan Hirsi Ali" start="2310">The point I want to make is Islam is a religion, when you take the scripture, that can be employed to wage war, and Islam as a civilization has known periods of peace, but you cannot -- if you pay attention to that history, pay attention to the evidence -- continue to say that Islam is a religion of peace. No monotheistic religion is a religion of peace. No monotheistic religion is only a religion of war. It is both. But in Islam, and that's why we are debating it in the 21st Century, there are more occurrences of violence and war and strife and subjection of women then there are in other religions. And my point -- our point is, let's not deny it, because by denying it we don't solve the problem. Let's admit it and then as intelligent people take it from there. What is to blame on external factors,</p><p end="2429" is_meta="false" speaker="Ayaan Hirsi Ali" start="2310">what is to blame on the inside?</p><p end="2429" is_meta="false" speaker="Maajid Nawaz" start="2310">So, forgive me for the assumption, Ayaan, it's a pleasure to be on the panel with you, by the way, but forgive me for the assumption, but do you speak Arabic? Have you studied Arabic grammar? And I'm asking for a purpose, which if you do give me the chance to explain I will, but that first of all just let me ask you that question.</p><p end="2554" is_meta="false" speaker="Ayaan Hirsi Ali" start="2429">I don't speak it as well as you do. And I want to know where the question is going before I give a full answer to that.</p><p end="2554" is_meta="true" speaker="Ayaan Hirsi Ali" start="2429">laughter</p><p end="2554" is_meta="false" speaker="Ayaan Hirsi Ali" start="2429">If you want me to quote the Koran I will.</p><p end="2554" is_meta="false" speaker="Maajid Nawaz" start="2429">You may be surprised, I don't know if I speak well or not, but the reason I'm asking is that you just quoted hadith, of the prophet, and you actually really did exaggerate what he said, and I'll quote to you the exact hadith in Arabic and then translate it. Now, what you quoted was --</p><p end="2554" is_meta="false" speaker="Maajid Nawaz" start="2429">Ayaan Hirsi Ali:It&#8217;s actually the Koran, but go on.</p><p end="2554" is_meta="false" speaker="Maajid Nawaz" start="2429">Well, Hadith is [unintelligible] --</p><p end="2554" is_meta="false" speaker="Ayaan Hirsi Ali" start="2429">It&#8217;s chapter 2, 191 to 193 --</p><p end="2554" is_meta="false" speaker="Maajid Nawaz" start="2429">[quotes hadith in Arabic] Now, what you quoted and in the translation was, "Kill and maim," and you went on and explained. Now actually [Arabic] means "to fight." Now,</p><p end="2554" is_meta="false" speaker="Maajid Nawaz" start="2429">I'm not saying that that's a good Hadith. What I'm saying is when we're translating, let's try and be accurate.</p><p end="2554" is_meta="false" speaker="Maajid Nawaz" start="2429">And that brings me to the point, and that is that I just thought of a word to describe this,</p><p end="2554" is_meta="false" speaker="Maajid Nawaz" start="2429">and it's just come to me so thank you because I want to use it forever onwards, and that is suspended intelligence. There's a tendency when discussing Islam to suspend the tools that we have learned and studied, and that you have studied as well, that we use to analyze every other piece of scripture and literature in the world, and that is that we recognize that texts do not speak for themselves. We recognize that when we interpret scriptures and texts and books and poetry that they are contextualized, that we have methodologies to approach them, when we're reading Shakespeare, when we're reading anything. We recognize that there's a way to interpret text and there are schools of thought and differences over how to approach texts.</p><p end="2554" is_meta="false" speaker="Maajid Nawaz" start="2429">Now, if we contextualize Martin Luther, and say the Reformation was a good thing,</p><p end="2554" is_meta="false" speaker="Maajid Nawaz" start="2429">despite the fact that he said, "Kill and slay the peasants wherever you find them," when they follow Thomas Muntzer -- when he was calling for not just breaking away from the papal authority but also for rebelling against the monarchies and the dictators that they found themselves in -- Martin Luther sided with the tyrants against Muntzer, and said,</p><p end="2554" is_meta="false" speaker="Maajid Nawaz" start="2429">"Kill the peasants wherever you find them." Despite that, I'm prepared to say the Reformation was a good thing. And the reason I'm prepared to say that is that Martin Luther must not be judged by the standards of civilization that we, after an accumulation of thousands of years, have arrived at. He must be judged by the standards of civilization that were around during his time. And that's how society evolves.</p><p end="2680" is_meta="false" speaker="Ayaan Hirsi Ali" start="2554">I --</p><p end="2680" is_meta="false" speaker="Maajid Nawaz" start="2554">And we recognize that for every other faith and for every other piece of literature, yet when it comes to Islam somehow we want to suspend.</p><p end="2680" is_meta="true" speaker="Maajid Nawaz" start="2554">talking simultaneously</p><p end="2680" is_meta="false" speaker="Maajid Nawaz" start="2554">But we learned about that and quote the [unintelligible].</p><p end="2680" is_meta="false" speaker="Douglas Murray" start="2554">Yes, we read things in their context. I mean, you read Chaucer in context. Chaucer doesn't have followers, doesn't have 1.4 billion people who believe every, or are meant to believe [unintelligible] --</p><p end="2680" is_meta="true" speaker="Douglas Murray" start="2554">talking simultaneously</p><p end="2680" is_meta="false" speaker="Maajid Nawaz" start="2554">Sorry, I quoted Martin Luther not Chaucer. I suppose Martin Luther does have followers--</p><p end="2680" is_meta="true" speaker="Maajid Nawaz" start="2554">talking simultaneously</p><p end="2680" is_meta="false" speaker="Douglas Murray" start="2554">If you allowed me to speak, I would address your lesser point. I will get there I promise.</p><p end="2680" is_meta="true" speaker="Douglas Murray" start="2554">laughter</p><p end="2680" is_meta="false" speaker="Douglas Murray" start="2554">You don&#8217;t -- we don&#8217;t have followers of Shakespeare who insist on, going to insist on following line-by-line everything Shakespeare did and believing everything he wrote.</p><p end="2680" is_meta="false" speaker="Douglas Murray" start="2554">That&#8217;s because it&#8217;s literature. Actually what&#8217;s happening, Maajid, you put your finger on the problem. It&#8217;s not us that&#8217;s not applying the rigorous critical faculty. We&#8217;re applying it to the Koran as we would to any other work of literature. You&#8217;re not because you can&#8217;t.</p><p end="2680" is_meta="false" speaker="Douglas Murray" start="2554">And the final thing is, Maajid, because Maajid knows very well that --</p><p end="2680" is_meta="false" speaker="Ayaan Hirsi Ali" start="2554">He is a believer and believers are not allowed to contextualize the text.</p><p end="2680" is_meta="false" speaker="Ayaan Hirsi Ali" start="2554">Because if you were allowed to contextualize, you would say some of the things that Mohammad did is crap.</p><p end="2680" is_meta="false" speaker="Ayaan Hirsi Ali" start="2554">[laughter]You would say some of the deeds --</p><p end="2680" is_meta="false" speaker="Ayaan Hirsi Ali" start="2554">You cannot contextualize.</p><p end="2680" is_meta="false" speaker="Maajid Nawaz" start="2554">No, that&#8217;s not true.</p><p end="2680" is_meta="false" speaker="Ayaan Hirsi Ali" start="2554">What do you think of Mohammad taking a six year old as a bride? What do you think of that?</p><p end="2680" is_meta="false" speaker="Maajid Nawaz" start="2554">I don&#8217;t think that&#8217;s a particularly good idea. However, what I would say --</p><p end="2680" is_meta="true" speaker="Maajid Nawaz" start="2554">laughter and applause</p><p end="2680" is_meta="false" speaker="Douglas Murray" start="2554">Glad to hear it.</p><p end="2680" is_meta="false" speaker="Maajid Nawaz" start="2554">There were many, many people in history that have done such a thing and what we&#8217;re talking about here is a failure to contextualize actions for the standards of their time. And I&#8217;ll come back to the point I made, because Douglas, you didn&#8217;t address it, despite your protestations --</p><p end="2680" is_meta="false" speaker="Douglas Murray" start="2554">I [unintelligible] --</p><p end="2680" is_meta="false" speaker="Maajid Nawaz" start="2554">Let me just ask you again. Martin Luther was a fundamentalist, wasn&#8217;t he?</p><p end="2680" is_meta="false" speaker="Douglas Murray" start="2554">Absolutely.</p><p end="2680" is_meta="true" speaker="Douglas Murray" start="2554">talking simultaneously</p><p end="2680" is_meta="false" speaker="Douglas Murray" start="2554">If there were currently Lutherans, and there are Lutherans around. You meet them occasionally in Scandinavia and so on. Very nice people.[laughter]</p><p end="2801" is_meta="false" speaker="Douglas Murray" start="2680">Very nice people and peaceable guys they are by and large. If, however, there was a large proportion of Lutherans somewhere in Scandinavia that started blowing up non-</p><p end="2801" is_meta="false" speaker="Douglas Murray" start="2680">Lutherans -- or no, sorry absolutely right -- started massacring peasants, do you think that people would say, hang on a minute, &#8220;Let&#8217;s not criticize Martin Luther. He did that by the standards of his time. We shouldn&#8217;t criticize his followers all that much. We shouldn&#8217;t point out that what he said.&#8221; No. We just say, &#8220;You know, don&#8217;t go and massacre peasants. Full stop. It was rubbish at the time and it is now.&#8221; It&#8217;s the same with the Koran.</p><p end="2801" is_meta="false" speaker="Maajid Nawaz" start="2680">You&#8217;re missing the point. You&#8217;re failing to judge --</p><p end="2801" is_meta="true" speaker="Maajid Nawaz" start="2680">applause</p><p end="2801" is_meta="false" speaker="Zeba Khan" start="2680">I just wanted to point out, when we&#8217;re talking about the Koran and saying that we can&#8217;t contextualize it, that&#8217;s simply not true. That is a debate that&#8217;s hot in the community amongst Muslim scholars and amongst Muslims themselves. We&#8217;re debating that very question. Is the Koran a living document? Much like -- it&#8217;s similar in comparison to the Constitution and the debates that happen around that. The fact is scholars say that when you look at the Koran in Arabic, there can be two, three, four, five, six interpretations for every word. There&#8217;re only certain things in the Koran that scholars agree are concrete,</p><p end="2801" is_meta="false" speaker="Zeba Khan" start="2680">like the concept of God, afterlife, things like that. But beyond that there is a wide, wide range of interpretation, which is why there is a history that not many people look at, and that&#8217;s part of the problem. That nobody&#8217;s actually looked at the history of debate within Islam about every sort of aspect that can come to mind.</p><p end="2801" is_meta="false" speaker="Ayaan Hirsi Ali" start="2680">I disagree with that. The reason I disagree with that -- it would be more accurate, Zeba, if you said the scholars that you find attractive say that. But there&#8217;s a bunch of scholars, a great number of following in Islam, take -- all of them are self-appointed by the way,</p><p end="2801" is_meta="false" speaker="Ayaan Hirsi Ali" start="2680">because there is no higher education, there is no seminary of Islam, except the University of Al-Azhar, we know the products of Al-Azhar, but there are scholars like bin Laden who say we have to take --</p><p end="2917" is_meta="false" speaker="Zeba Khan" start="2801">He&#8217;s not a scholar by anyone&#8217;s measure.</p><p end="2917" is_meta="false" speaker="Zeba Khan" start="2801">That&#8217;s not true.</p><p end="2917" is_meta="false" speaker="Ayaan Hirsi Ali" start="2801">The Islamic Brotherhood, Hassan al-Banna, when you to look at the Sunni Islam. When you look at the Ayatollah Khomeini in the 20th Century, the most influential guy of Shia Islam is another self-appointed scholar. Sheikh bin Baz, he has the greatest following.</p><p end="2917" is_meta="false" speaker="Ayaan Hirsi Ali" start="2801">Sheikh al Qaradawi. Maybe these are individuals that are not attractive to you, but then it would be more accurate if you stated that. They are attractive to many Muslims, not thousands but in the millions, and what they say -- and that&#8217;s why they&#8217;re influential -- is they challenge every single Muslim individual, are you a true Muslim? If you are a true Muslim, you live by what the Koran dictates, you follow the example of the Prophet Mohammad.</p><p end="2917" is_meta="false" speaker="Zeba Khan" start="2801">Right. Their interpretation, though.</p><p end="2917" is_meta="false" speaker="Ayaan Hirsi Ali" start="2801">Those scholars insist on that, are far more influential, far more powerful than your soft-</p><p end="2917" is_meta="false" speaker="Ayaan Hirsi Ali" start="2801">spoken, wonderful, cuddly scholars.</p><p end="2917" is_meta="true" speaker="Ayaan Hirsi Ali" start="2801">laughter and applause</p><p end="2917" is_meta="false" speaker="Maajid Nawaz" start="2801">Ayaan, you just quoted bin Laden as a scholar. Hassan al-Banna as a scholar. Bin Laden, for those of you who don&#8217;t know, is an engineer, a qualified engineer. So you don't know him.</p><p end="2917" is_meta="false" speaker="Ayaan Hirsi Ali" start="2801">Why don't you define whose --</p><p end="2917" is_meta="false" speaker="Maajid Nawaz" start="2801">Don&#8217;t know his history. He's a qualified engineer who comes from one of the richest construction families in Saudi Arabia and was educated in the elite private schools of Switzerland and Saudi Arabia. Hassan al-Banna that you referred to was a school teacher. And in fact what you find common with all of the movements that you are worried about, and that I am worried about, and we're all worried about, are that they are founded by people who do not have a theological background. Now, for all we think about Al-Azhar, and they have very conservative views, what we don't find is that Al-</p><p end="2917" is_meta="false" speaker="Maajid Nawaz" start="2801">Azhar produces the likes of bin Laden and Hassan al-Banna, or even Maududi, the founder of Jamaat-e-Islami Islam in the Indian subcontinent. Maududi was a journalist.</p><p end="2917" is_meta="false" speaker="Maajid Nawaz" start="2801">Sayyid Qutb, the founder of modern day Jihadism, was a literary critic who came to America on a scholarship in the 1950s to study literature. He was not a theologian. So coming back to the point --</p><p end="3042" is_meta="false" speaker="Ayaan Hirsi Ali" start="2917">Why don't you name a number of scholars who are influential who are not --</p><p end="3042" is_meta="false" speaker="Maajid Nawaz" start="2917">Please, Ayaan, don't define for the whole world who a Muslim scholar is, because actually the people you referred to were not qualified theologians.</p><p end="3042" is_meta="false" speaker="Ayaan Hirsi Ali" start="2917">But don't you touch on the problem by admitting this? Don't you touch on the problem that is inherent in Islam after the death of Mohammad, that the problem of who speaks for Islam has not been resolved. It could be the two of you. It could be bin Laden. It could be al Qaradawi. It could be Faisal Shahzad.</p><p end="3042" is_meta="true" speaker="Ayaan Hirsi Ali" start="2917">talking simultaneously</p><p end="3042" is_meta="false" speaker="Ayaan Hirsi Ali" start="2917">That is a brilliant question.</p><p end="3042" is_meta="true" speaker="Ayaan Hirsi Ali" start="2917">laughter</p><p end="3042" is_meta="false" speaker="Ayaan Hirsi Ali" start="2917">You can start by saying Islam is something to -- a different thing to 1.57 billion people.</p><p end="3042" is_meta="false" speaker="Ayaan Hirsi Ali" start="2917">And from that general point, you can reduce it to what is it that unifies them? And ultimately, you will get to the Koran and the hadith. The Koran, the hadith, the day of judgment. The belief in the day of judgment, and if you take those three concepts, then it's far from a religion of peace because you look, first of all, not only at the content of the Koran -- in context, fine. I am willing to contextualize it. But what if other believes are not, and they're influential? What if I want to read Mohammad's practices simply as a matter of history, another great figure in history? But more Muslims, millions of Muslims don't want to do that and really want to follow his practices. What if more and more Muslims invest in the hereafter more than they invest in life? Then we have a problem. And that's why I ask you to vote against the motion, it cannot be only a religion of peace, because if it were only a religion of peace, if it were perfect, why would we have this debate, why would we --</p><p end="3152" is_meta="false" speaker="Douglas Murray" start="3042">Imagine trying to imply that the whole extremist problem is a misreading by engineers and literary critics. Unfortunately, that's simply not the case, hasn't been historically in Islam, and isn't now. Ayatollah Khomeini, who Ayaan mentioned earlier, was not a self-</p><p end="3152" is_meta="false" speaker="Douglas Murray" start="3042">trained engineer, rich boy, like -- you know, unfortunately, and managed to hurtle a very developed, distinguished culture back in time in 1979, and hurtled this country back into the state it's currently in, under these cloaked dictators.

On Khomeini. I acknowledge Khomeini is a trained theologian. And the fact is he came in the '70s, Douglas. And that proves something. What was he so famous for?</p><p end="3152" is_meta="false" speaker="Maajid Nawaz" start="3042">Khomeini was recognized for bringing a revolution in Shiite theology. And what was the revolution? Those of you who have studied this will know that the revolution was, up until him, Shiites had been avowedly religiously secular, because they believed no one had the right to rule in God's name until the Messiah came, and let them wait for that Messiah until the end of time. Khomeini changed that and turned it on its head. And if that proves something, it proves one thing, and that is it was not in -- it was not consistent with Islamic Shiite tradition. What he did was a very modern revolution, influenced by his studies in Europe and influenced by modern European fascism. He broke from tradition, and that's why it was called a revolution. He was not a continuant of Shiite traditionalism.</p><p end="3152" is_meta="false" speaker="Ayaan Hirsi Ali" start="3042">It's the fault of the Europeans, in other words.</p><p end="3152" is_meta="false" speaker="Maajid Nawaz" start="3042">No, no. No one's saying it's --</p><p end="3152" is_meta="false" speaker="Maajid Nawaz" start="3042">Come on --</p><p end="3152" is_meta="true" speaker="Maajid Nawaz" start="3042">talking simultaneously</p><p end="3271" is_meta="false" speaker="Zeba Khan" start="3152">It needs a renaissance. It doesn't need a reform. Reform in the sense -- and the reason I say that is because we have to be careful of our terminology. If we say reform as in Reformation, we're thinking of a Christian context where you had the Protestants and Martin Luther rejecting the Catholicism and the Pope. But the thing is in Islam, there is no Pope. There is no centralized authority. So there can't be a reformation in that sense.</p><p end="3271" is_meta="false" speaker="Zeba Khan" start="3152">What there needs to be is a return to genuine Islamic principles which have been not studies, have not been enforced and were forgotten. So it's not exactly that.</p><p end="3271" is_meta="false" speaker="Ayaan Hirsi Ali" start="3152">A return to genuine Islamic principles is exactly what al-Qaeda is advocating.</p><p end="3271" is_meta="false" speaker="Zeba Khan" start="3152">No, that's not actually what they're -- no, that's actually incorrect.</p><p end="3271" is_meta="false" speaker="Ayaan Hirsi Ali" start="3152">A return, a rebirth --</p><p end="3271" is_meta="true" speaker="Ayaan Hirsi Ali" start="3152">talking simultaneously</p><p end="3271" is_meta="false" speaker="Ayaan Hirsi Ali" start="3152">When you look at the extremist -- the organizations that we've come to call extremist,</p><p end="3271" is_meta="false" speaker="Ayaan Hirsi Ali" start="3152">where they're advocating, when they answer the question what went wrong, we had this empire, we lost it, how do we regain it? Their answer is a rebirth. Let's go back to the origins, a revival of it. Is that what you want, Zeba?</p><p end="3271" is_meta="false" speaker="Zeba Khan" start="3152">No. They actually co-opt the language for their own political purposes. Al-Qaeda is not calling for a return to Islam or to original Islam or anything like that. They're actually using Islam as a cover for their political grievances. When you look at and ask Muslims,</p><p end="3271" is_meta="false" speaker="Zeba Khan" start="3152">ask 1.5 billion Muslims, when you look at the mainstream, they're 90 percent. They're peaceful and fine. When you look at the politically radicalized, when you ask them whatdo they fear most? They say Western domination and occupation. But when you ask mainstream Muslims what they fear, they say economic issues, unemployment.</p><p end="3391" is_meta="false" speaker="Zeba Khan" start="3271">There's a clear difference. And so they are not -- what we can determine from that is it's not religion because religiosity between the two is indistinguishable, how pious they are,</p><p end="3391" is_meta="false" speaker="Zeba Khan" start="3271">indistinguishable. It's the one factor that makes the difference is what they focus on and their grievances against -- perceived grievances against the West.</p><p end="3391" is_meta="false" speaker="Douglas Murray" start="3271">But don't we get back to one of the core problems which you still haven't addressed,</p><p end="3391" is_meta="false" speaker="Douglas Murray" start="3271">which is the life of Mohammad and his teachings, which is as follows. If a Christian group decides to go back to the teachings of Christ, you know, the worst stuff they find is the Sermon on the Mount of Olive. They find one verse where Jesus is saying, I think in the Gospel of Matthew, to have said &#8220;I come not to bring peace but a sword.&#8221; But the rest of it is all love thy neighbor and all that sort of stuff. If you're a Christian group looking to go back to the sources of Christianity, you just find a lot of, well, hippie stuff,</p><p end="3391" is_meta="false" speaker="Douglas Murray" start="3271">for a lot of modern people.</p><p end="3391" is_meta="true" speaker="Douglas Murray" start="3271">laughter</p><p end="3391" is_meta="false" speaker="Douglas Murray" start="3271">So what is it about this religion we're talking about tonight that you say is a religion of peace, that when people go back to the origins, they find a founder who was violent,</p><p end="3391" is_meta="false" speaker="Douglas Murray" start="3271">teaching violence.</p><p end="3391" is_meta="false" speaker="Maajid Nawaz" start="3271">See, this comes back to what you mean by people going back to the origins. And I refuse, as does Zeba, and as we're asking for all of you to do, is to refuse for Islam to be hijacked and monopolized by the Bin Ladens of this world who want to tell you what it means to go back to the original sources. Now, if that was the case, then I ask you why is it that in Bangladesh, where there was a free and fair election, the Islamist party lost roundly. They completely lost the elections. In Pakistan, where there were recent elections, the Islamist alliance in the north that came to prominence after the occupation of Afghanistan, they completely lost all their seats. So the Muslims in two of the most populous Muslim majority countries in the world, as like as is the case in Indonesia,</p><p end="3391" is_meta="false" speaker="Maajid Nawaz" start="3271">whenever they have a chance to vote, they do not vote for the Islamist extremists. And time and time again in elections across Muslim majority states, they have proven that their interpretation of Islam -- and they are the majority -- is not the interpretation of Douglas, Ayaan and bin Laden. Now, I don't want to be in that camp.</p><p end="3508" is_meta="false" speaker="Zeba Khan" start="3391">The perception is that for a lot of people looking at the Muslim world in Muslim majority countries is that Muslim women are somehow -- they aren't -- they're subjugated, that they don't -- to a point where they are intimidated to ask for their rights and to demand them. But that's not the case. I mean, when you look at all -- when you look across Muslim majority countries, if you look at Iran, for example, where there is zero gender gap in education, by the way -- men and women enjoy the same amount of education.</p><p end="3508" is_meta="false" speaker="Zeba Khan" start="3391">Obviously when you're at that level of education, you're aware of what your rights are and what you are demanding. And so in Iran and places like that, they are demanding their rights, they are pushing for them. In places like Afghanistan or Pakistan where the gender gap is larger, that gap obviously needs to be filled. But there are women who are pushing there as well. It's women that are stepping up and taking the lead on this.</p><p end="3631" is_meta="false" speaker="Ayaan Hirsi Ali" start="3508">Well, when I tried to define Islam as a religion, religion there is expression, you find in the Koran is expression after expression, verse after verse, and also in the Hadith, that women are subordinate to men, that they have a guardian -- they need to have a guardian,</p><p end="3631" is_meta="false" speaker="Ayaan Hirsi Ali" start="3508">their testimony is worth half of that of men, they can only inherit half of what their brother inherits. When it comes to sexual offenses, women are the ones who get -- in reality, where Sharia is implemented, and that is not only the practical side of Islam but also the fellowship side of Islam -- everywhere where Sharia is implemented, and there are more places in the world today where Sharia as a family law is implemented and where it's not implemented on a political level, but in all of those places you see a subjugation of women. You see honor killings. You see women who are deniededucation. If you look on a global level, levels of illiteracy among women in the Middle East is appalling. That's not something that I'm telling you because I misunderstand Islam, but that is report after report, and the latest one is the United Nations, the UNDP Human Development Report that was first published in 2002 and was again published in 2003, 2004.</p><p end="3631" is_meta="false" speaker="Ayaan Hirsi Ali" start="3508">And if you follow these reports, this is empirics -- this is not something that I'm imagining -- the situation of women in the Middle East in Muslim countries is dire. And the principles that underlie it and the practices are Islamic, it's Sharia law in action. And the appalling -- the nightmare is women who have fled those countries who are now in the West -- American citizens, European citizens, are subjected to parts of Sharia law.</p><p end="3631" is_meta="false" speaker="Ayaan Hirsi Ali" start="3508">And Zeba, I think that denying that -- not just as a matter of debate but, I then try to question, "Where does your solidarity lie as a woman who grew up in a free country, a free woman, and as vocal as you are, shouldn't you be more solidaire with them?&#8221;</p><p end="3757" is_meta="false" speaker="Zeba Khan" start="3631">I am.</p><p end="3757" is_meta="true" speaker="Zeba Khan" start="3631">applause</p><p end="3757" is_meta="false" speaker="Zeba Khan" start="3631">I am. But I don't want to -- I absolutely am and as all women should be and all human beings should demand the rights of equality. In fact, most Muslims want equal rights for the women in their societies, and just go to the research, go to the polls, go to the research and what it says. When you ask men, "Should women have equal rights?" majority in countries surveyed in the Gallup survey said, "Yes, they should have equal rights,"</p><p end="3757" is_meta="false" speaker="Zeba Khan" start="3631">including in Saudi Arabia.</p><p end="3757" is_meta="false" speaker="Maajid Nawaz" start="3631">I want to acknowledge that there -- a lot more needs to be done and a lot more needs to be said about eliminating some of the practices that you referred to, Ayaan. And I recognize that there are practices in Muslim majority societies across the world that are repugnant not just to a Western mind but generally to any decent rational human being. But I'm going to approach this being a man, and the first man on the panel to call in on this question, I want to approach this from a slightly different angle, and that is this, that many of you in the audience are men, and if the law of average was to fall true, then you'd be probably around 50 percent. Now, how many of you would be comfortable with your spouse, your wife as your boss at the same time? And it may sound -- you know, itmay actually be a truism because for many people in a marriage the boss is the wife, but -</p><p end="3757" is_meta="false" speaker="Maajid Nawaz" start="3631">-</p><p end="3757" is_meta="true" speaker="Maajid Nawaz" start="3631">laughter</p><p end="3757" is_meta="false" speaker="Maajid Nawaz" start="3631">-- the reason I'm asking that question is that even in times like today, many men find that uncomfortable, to be married to their boss, and yet Ayaan, who referred to these practices that were repugnant to us and said that they are sourced in Islam, the founder of Islam,</p><p end="3757" is_meta="false" speaker="Maajid Nawaz" start="3631">the prophet, Mohammad, his boss -- his first wife was his boss. And many people don't know that. And so what I want to demonstrate by this point is that it's a complex matter.</p><p end="3757" is_meta="false" speaker="Maajid Nawaz" start="3631">There are practices in Muslim majority societies that we need to reform, but it's too simplistic to trace them back to the life of a man who lived 1,400 years ago. And in many of these practices, what's quite revolutionary for his time, and in others was like every other man during his time.</p><p end="3870" is_meta="false" speaker="Maajid Nawaz" start="3757">The fact that he referred to -- Douglas refers to the fact that he had a bride that was underage, is something which we can now look back on and say, "That was an awful practice," but just as we look back on many things the Romans did and say that was an awful practice, just as we look back on many things Martin Luther did and say that was an awful practice, but we don&#8217;t judge these men by the standards that we have today.</p><p end="3870" is_meta="false" speaker="Douglas Murray" start="3757">Yeah, we do, we should. We should, Maajid, and may I say it&#8217;s a bit too cutesy to compare a man who raped a 9-year-old girl repeatedly with men being kind of, you know, kind of the wife, the bit of the wife being the master of the household and so on.</p><p end="3870" is_meta="false" speaker="Douglas Murray" start="3757">A bit too cutesy. A bit too much of avoiding the issue, which is this. This is actually a very real concern which doesn&#8217;t just apply in mid-7th Century Arabia but today, here and now, in Britain, in my own country. We now have, thanks to an arbitration act put into law in 1990, whereby people can have civil disputes arbitrated under laws they can decide on. But we now have Sharia courts in Great Britain and Sharia courts in Great Britain are operated by people who are, actually, clerics, they are religious authorities.</p><p end="3870" is_meta="false" speaker="Douglas Murray" start="3757">There&#8217;s one, well, Sadiqi in Leicester. Now this man runs a separate Sharia court. A couple of years ago it turned out that we found out about the sort of thing he was deciding, and sadly, again, it&#8217;s not reformist stuff, because when you go back to the Sharia, people take lessons from it and they make judgments like the following. Six women, six women who had gone to the Sharia court because they were being physically abused by their husbands, they were persuaded to drop the cases because this should be a matter between a Muslim woman and Muslim husband in a Sharia court. This should not be a matter for the police in Great Britain in 2008. That stinks.</p><p end="3870" is_meta="false" speaker="Douglas Murray" start="3757">What&#8217;s more, there had been another case. A local man, a local Muslim man, died.</p><p end="3998" is_meta="false" speaker="Douglas Murray" start="3870">His will was arbitrated by Sharia because that is what happens now in 21st Century Britain. And the arbitration of this man&#8217;s will gave half the inheritance to the daughters as to the sons of the man, because that&#8217;s what they have in the Koran.</p><p end="3998" is_meta="true" speaker="Douglas Murray" start="3870">talking simultaneously</p><p end="3998" is_meta="false" speaker="Douglas Murray" start="3870">Yeah, the point is that when you look at the courts that are doing this, when you look at the religious authorities, when you look at the clerics the judgments they&#8217;re making,</p><p end="3998" is_meta="false" speaker="Douglas Murray" start="3870">those are the kind of judgments. I wish that Maajid would get some clerics on his side who could set up rival Sharia courts that didn&#8217;t decide that women were second class citizens but sadly at the moment that is the case.</p><p end="3998" is_meta="false" speaker="Maajid Nawaz" start="3870">But Douglas, the irony was, as you know well, the person who came out most publicly in support of those regrettable Sharia courts in the U.K. was the Archbishop of Canterbury.</p><p end="3998" is_meta="false" speaker="Maajid Nawaz" start="3870">And we at Quilliam opposed their creation, and actually many Muslims in Britain do oppose them because it raises a question. Islam has never had a clergy. It&#8217;s never had a pope. And so when you try and institute Sharia courts as law, the question arises, whose Sharia do you follow? Now that&#8217;s an internal debate that&#8217;s going on and raging and that I am part of in Pakistan for example, because there isn&#8217;t one version of Sharia and everything you&#8217;ve referred to is bad. We condemn these practices. The fact is we can&#8217;t call them -- we can&#8217;t be reductionist, essentialist, simplistic, and call it Sharia because there isn&#8217;t on Sharia as you well know, just as there isn&#8217;t one reading of Shakespeare.</p><p end="3998" is_meta="true" speaker="Maajid Nawaz" start="3870">talking simultaneously</p><p end="3998" is_meta="true" speaker="Maajid Nawaz" start="3870">applause</p><p end="4113" is_meta="false" speaker="Zeba Khan" start="3998">Yeah.</p><p end="4113" is_meta="true" speaker="Zeba Khan" start="3998">applause</p><p end="4113" is_meta="false" speaker="Zeba Khan" start="3998">Yes, that was a great question.</p><p end="4113" is_meta="false" speaker="Zeba Khan" start="3998">Oh, sorry.</p><p end="4234" is_meta="false" speaker="Zeba Khan" start="4113">So what I don't -- I can't say is -- I know that it's a complicated question. And so you have history involved. You have different factors that contribute to the answer. What I can say for sure, just based on looking at the studies that come out, is that the level of religiosity, the level of piety, of violent terrorists compared to mainstream Muslims is virtually there's no difference. So it's literally when you ask them how practicing they are, how often do they attend services, things like that, it's literally the same. So that can't be the distinguishing factor. What we do know, as I mentioned earlier, is when you ask them -- the one big difference is when you ask them what they fear the most, and they say their perceived idea of Western domination, which is very similar to what we hear from our opposition, a perceived fear of Islamic domination. And so when you compare that to the mainstream who just want to get a job and --</p><p end="4234" is_meta="false" speaker="Ayaan Hirsi Ali" start="4113">We'll -- I'll move on.</p><p end="4234" is_meta="false" speaker="Maajid Nawaz" start="4113">Can I just add something?</p><p end="4234" is_meta="false" speaker="Maajid Nawaz" start="4113">I think just to add something, that it's -- the preponderance has a lot to do with the spread of a certain ideology that I refer to as Islamism that has arisen in the post-colonial context and that was exported to the Middle East through geopolitics. Now, what happened wasthat there was a need for a cause to resist against colonialism. And Britain was a secular liberal country. The cause of the ideology that the Arabs adopted, who were resisting initially, was Arab socialism, Baathism. And that morphed into Islamism, which owes much of its origins to Arab socialism.</p><p end="4234" is_meta="false" speaker="Maajid Nawaz" start="4113">And so what we find is that the spread of this ideology, pretty much like how post World War I Europe, with the identity crisis that emerged after the Weimar Republic led to the growth of fascism in Europe, with fascism in Italy, Naziism in Germany and totalitarian Stalinism in the USSR.</p><p end="4356" is_meta="false" speaker="Maajid Nawaz" start="4234">We see the same thing playing out post empire in the Middle East. So what it's related to is the spread of this ideology that has hijacked the minds of many young Muslims. And yes, Muslims need to do more to challenge this ideology. We are trying to convince them of that. But this is a very modern phenomenon. And I remind you, Khomeini is a modern phenomenon, and he created a revolution where he flipped Shiite theology on its head, as are the others, bin Laden, Sayyid Qutb, they are all modern phenomenon.</p><p end="4356" is_meta="false" speaker="Ayaan Hirsi Ali" start="4234">Yes, because what --</p><p end="4356" is_meta="false" speaker="Maajid Nawaz" start="4234">Should have kept my mouth shut.</p><p end="4356" is_meta="false" speaker="Ayaan Hirsi Ali" start="4234">Maajid, what you are saying is Islamism is invented by the British, Islamism has nothing to do with Islam. External, external, external, those poor Muslims who are seduced with the Koran and the activities of Mohammad, their own culture, their own convictions, their own history, they have -- you know -- they are only the victims. Ideas inspire. Ideas unite. Ideas people bring together. And Mohammad succeeded first and foremost in uniting a disparate Bedouin desert Arab group of people. And they unified, and they conquered. And when it worked, it was all Islam. When Muslims were successful, when they conquered lands, it was all great. It was Islam. Now that we are faced with this problem, it's Islamism. It was created by the British Empire. I just want for the other side -- I don't think we will ever be able to address this issue if we systematically refuse to acknowledge, and that is what that side of the panel is doing.</p><p end="4356" is_meta="false" speaker="Ayaan Hirsi Ali" start="4234">-- to -- let me finish it.</p><p end="4356" is_meta="false" speaker="Ayaan Hirsi Ali" start="4234">-- to systematically -- systematically refuse to acknowledge the flaws of Islam. I grew up as a Muslim. I left Islam. Why did it do it? Because I couldn't hide away from the blemishes. And I believe we can improve that. I can believe we can inspire young Muslims and the youth bulge -- there are millions and millions of young Muslim men under the age of 30.</p><p end="4474" is_meta="false" speaker="Ayaan Hirsi Ali" start="4356">That in itself is a source of violence. [unintelligible].</p><p end="4474" is_meta="false" speaker="Ayaan Hirsi Ali" start="4356">We can inspire them if we can only acknowledge that part of the problem is us, not just the British empire.</p><p end="4474" is_meta="false" speaker="Maajid Nawaz" start="4356">I'm not saying it's the fault of the British. If I was going to say that, I would have joined a very successful British law firm --</p><p end="4474" is_meta="false" speaker="Ayaan Hirsi Ali" start="4356">What has Islamism got to do with Islam?</p><p end="4474" is_meta="false" speaker="Maajid Nawaz" start="4356">I'm saying to you I would have been a lawyer, and I would have gone on with my life.</p><p end="4474" is_meta="false" speaker="Maajid Nawaz" start="4356">I'm taking responsibility for that, and I'm trying to get others to take responsibility for the growth of Islamism within Muslim mind and challenge that. So no one's blaming the British, and no one's --</p><p end="4474" is_meta="false" speaker="Ayaan Hirsi Ali" start="4356">Islamism is not Islam.</p><p end="4474" is_meta="false" speaker="Maajid Nawaz" start="4356">So there have been many, many such fatwas or pronouncements against suicide bombings. In many cases, they're not reported. There does need to be more. However,</p><p end="4474" is_meta="false" speaker="Maajid Nawaz" start="4356">I'll give you an example of why, in some cases, there aren't more. Now, recently, we at Quilliam publicized a fatwa by Dr. Tahir-ul-Qadri against terrorism, no ifs, no buts condemnation of suicide bombing and terrorism that Douglas -- always a pleasure to speak with you on the panel -- supported and was quoted in the press as supporting Dr.</p><p end="4474" is_meta="false" speaker="Maajid Nawaz" start="4356">Tahir-ul-Qadri&#8217;s fatwa against terrorism. Now, the reason why there aren't many more such examples, though there are quite a few, is because prior to Dr. Tahir-ul-Qadri issuing this fatwa, his colleague, who was also from the same way of thinking, was assassinated in Pakistan, was killed by a suicide bomber in a mosque where all the congregants who were praying were also blown to smithereens because he had the guts to simply give a sermon in that mosque condemning suicide bombings.</p><p end="4474" is_meta="false" speaker="Maajid Nawaz" start="4356">And so this is why many people are scared, because it takes guts, I tell you, to go into Pakistan and try and challenge these extremists. That's a country that doesn't have much rule of law. It's a country that's struggling against the so-called Pakistani Taliban from taking over a third of their country. And they're fighting that fight on the front lines.</p><p end="4474" is_meta="false" speaker="Maajid Nawaz" start="4356">And there are those who are brave enough just to give a speech to condemn terrorism,</p><p end="4474" is_meta="false" speaker="Maajid Nawaz" start="4356">and they're blown to smithereens in their mosque while praying.</p><p end="4592" is_meta="false" speaker="Douglas Murray" start="4474">Maajid.</p><p end="4592" is_meta="false" speaker="Maajid Nawaz" start="4474">And surely, they're religious people. They were praying in a mosque. You did support that fatwa.</p><p end="4592" is_meta="false" speaker="Douglas Murray" start="4474">I did. It's the only time I've ever done a book review of a fatwa. The -- I'm sorry to say,</p><p end="4592" is_meta="false" speaker="Douglas Murray" start="4474">Maajid, you seem to have just proved our point.</p><p end="4592" is_meta="false" speaker="Ayaan Hirsi Ali" start="4474">Yes.</p><p end="4592" is_meta="false" speaker="Douglas Murray" start="4474">Am I --</p><p end="4592" is_meta="true" speaker="Douglas Murray" start="4474">applause</p><p end="4592" is_meta="false" speaker="Maajid Nawaz" start="4474">Please explain.</p><p end="4592" is_meta="false" speaker="Maajid Nawaz" start="4474">Douglas Murray:Is it -- I mean, this is a very important and a very interesting question why more people don't stand up. I much admire Tahir-ul-Qadri for that fatwa, as I have other people who have stood up. For the number of times I have spoken behind closed doors and so on,</p><p end="4592" is_meta="false" speaker="Maajid Nawaz" start="4474">and you say, why aren't you saying anything, they say because if I do speak up, I'll be killed. Well, I address you again, ladies and gentlemen, to the motion.</p><p end="4592" is_meta="true" speaker="Maajid Nawaz" start="4474">laughter</p><p end="4592" is_meta="false" speaker="Maajid Nawaz" start="4474">I'm sorry. Sorry. Hang on. Hang on. How on earth -- how on earth does fear of being killed in Pakistan by a minority faction of extremists prove Islam is not a religion of peace?</p><p end="4592" is_meta="false" speaker="Douglas Murray" start="4474">Well, let me put it this way -- let me put it this way then.</p><p end="4592" is_meta="false" speaker="Maajid Nawaz" start="4474">It takes -- no, sorry. Sorry. [applause] I've got to -- because really, what you just said is really quite absurd. And I've got to clarify. It takes one person to kill all of us here, one person in a suicide bombing. Now, if we were scared of saying what we're saying now because of that one person, it doesn't mean all of us love war and hate peace in any way whatsoever. It means we all fear that one person who could walk through that door with a suicide bomb jacket strapped to his chest.</p><p end="4592" is_meta="false" speaker="Douglas Murray" start="4474">But Maajid, if we were discussing --</p><p end="4592" is_meta="false" speaker="Maajid Nawaz" start="4474">That's an absurd argument, Douglas.</p><p end="4592" is_meta="false" speaker="Douglas Murray" start="4474">-- [unintelligible] here tonight, does anyone think that when a Quaker said, I am quite fearful about speaking up against certain things, and I say -- come on, this only happens with Islam. There is no other major faith in the world today --</p><p end="4592" is_meta="false" speaker="Maajid Nawaz" start="4474">For that to be true --</p><p end="4592" is_meta="false" speaker="Douglas Murray" start="4474">Where it is the case that people are fearful of addressing religion because they're afraid they'll be killed.</p><p end="4592" is_meta="false" speaker="Maajid Nawaz" start="4474">For that to be true --</p><p end="4592" is_meta="false" speaker="Maajid Nawaz" start="4474">Douglas Murray:It's only Islam. And we're saying there's a reason.</p><p end="4592" is_meta="false" speaker="Ayaan Hirsi Ali" start="4474">I'm afraid of being killed by apostates. And many of you who came here tonight came under unusual circumstances. I am not in government. I am not a powerful person. I am a citizen. I mean, just a normal ordinary --</p><p end="4592" is_meta="false" speaker="Ayaan Hirsi Ali" start="4474">Unusual circumstances. You went through metal detectors to come to a debate in New York.</p><p end="4716" is_meta="false" speaker="Ayaan Hirsi Ali" start="4592">I mean, talk about [unintelligible].</p><p end="4716" is_meta="false" speaker="Maajid Nawaz" start="4592">That's because it takes one person to get through those metal detectors and blow us up.</p><p end="4716" is_meta="false" speaker="Ayaan Hirsi Ali" start="4592">Let me finish.

I hope no one threatens the chair.</p><p end="4716" is_meta="false" speaker="Ayaan Hirsi Ali" start="4592">My answer is yes, on condition that first of all Islam is not a religion of peace, and I hope that we've demonstrated here tonight that it's not.</p><p end="4831" is_meta="false" speaker="Ayaan Hirsi Ali" start="4716">Can it become a religion of peace? Yes, if a number of conditions are met.</p><p end="4831" is_meta="false" speaker="Ayaan Hirsi Ali" start="4716">But let me complete the condition --</p><p end="4831" is_meta="false" speaker="Zeba Khan" start="4716">-- and not only practice it peacefully, but we --</p><p end="4831" is_meta="false" speaker="Ayaan Hirsi Ali" start="4716">Why are we having again, over and over again -- first of all, in my view no monotheistic religion because there is that divider between "We" and "They" and because when that unified -- when there are so many factors within every monotheistic religion that make itinherently aggressive, it's not only Islam, but there are a number of factors that in the 21st Century combine -- again, there is the history of militarism and the awareness of that,</p><p end="4831" is_meta="false" speaker="Ayaan Hirsi Ali" start="4716">there is the victim status, there is the youth bulge, let's not forget that, there is the revival of that theology, the revival of the example of the prophet Mohammad, the investment in the hereafter. And you say a lot of people practice their religion in peace. What we know is that a lot of people are passive and actually not practicing their faith, are not practicing Islamic scripture --</p><p end="4831" is_meta="false" speaker="Zeba Khan" start="4716">Who are you to say who's practicing --</p><p end="4831" is_meta="false" speaker="Ayaan Hirsi Ali" start="4716">Let me finish -- let me finish --</p><p end="4831" is_meta="false" speaker="Zeba Khan" start="4716">-- their faith and who's not?</p><p end="4831" is_meta="false" speaker="Ayaan Hirsi Ali" start="4716">-- let me finish, [unintelligible] --</p><p end="4831" is_meta="false" speaker="Zeba Khan" start="4716">It's not for you to decide.

Are you [unintelligible] --</p><p end="4831" is_meta="false" speaker="Ayaan Hirsi Ali" start="4716">No, but let me say, you are not practicing --</p><p end="4831" is_meta="false" speaker="Ayaan Hirsi Ali" start="4716">-- [unintelligible] wait a minute, I want to finish.</p><p end="4831" is_meta="false" speaker="Ayaan Hirsi Ali" start="4716">You are not practicing Chapter 2 of the Koran, verse 191 and 193, "And slay them wherever you find them, and drive them out of places whence they drove you out, for persecution of Muslims is worse than the slaughter of the nonbeliever."</p><p end="4831" is_meta="false" speaker="Zeba Khan" start="4716">Chapter 2, "Let there be no compulsion in religion."</p><p end="4831" is_meta="false" speaker="Ayaan Hirsi Ali" start="4716">You are not -- you are not --</p><p end="4831" is_meta="false" speaker="Zeba Khan" start="4716">Chapter 2, "Each community --"</p><p end="4831" is_meta="false" speaker="Ayaan Hirsi Ali" start="4716">Yeah, okay, what is that -- okay, great, I love that.</p><p end="4831" is_meta="false" speaker="Zeba Khan" start="4716">"-- which has given direction as it follows, all of you compete in the performance of good deeds."</p><p end="4831" is_meta="false" speaker="Ayaan Hirsi Ali" start="4716">Which proves my point [unintelligible] --</p><p end="4952" is_meta="true" speaker="Ayaan Hirsi Ali" start="4831">talking simultaneously</p><p end="4952" is_meta="false" speaker="Ayaan Hirsi Ali" start="4831">That proves my point. If you read the peaceful --</p><p end="4952" is_meta="false" speaker="Ayaan Hirsi Ali" start="4831">That proves my point. If you read from the Koran and you say it's a religion of no compulsion and you believe that that verse is practiced by a person like you, you will concede that there are other Muslims who will read the verse that I just quoted and be inspired to engage in acts of violence. And, by the way, the verse that you just said, it has a latter part that says, "Except for the unbeliever --"</p><p end="4952" is_meta="false" speaker="Zeba Khan" start="4831">Sure, I'm sure every [unintelligible] --</p><p end="4952" is_meta="true" speaker="Zeba Khan" start="4831">talking simultaneously</p><p end="4952" is_meta="true" speaker="Zeba Khan" start="4831">laughter</p><p end="4952" is_meta="false" speaker="Ayaan Hirsi Ali" start="4831">[Unintelligible] well, my last point was that it is both, it's not just a religion of peace, it's also a religion of war, and both verses prove that.</p><p end="4952" is_meta="true" speaker="Zeba Khan" start="4831">Inaudible</p><p end="4952" is_meta="false" speaker="Douglas Murray" start="4831">And that is an important one. Ayaan and I and people who make some of the points we make are often accused of taking bits of the Koran out of context. But I think you've just seen a very good example of it from the other side. I'm not saying that that isn't a good verse to live one's life by. One cannot just simply quote the verse about there being no compulsion in religion as though it doesn't have a follow on --</p><p end="4952" is_meta="false" speaker="Zeba Khan" start="4831">And you can't quote the other ones either without context.</p><p end="4952" is_meta="false" speaker="Ayaan Hirsi Ali" start="4831">It has a follow on.</p><p end="4952" is_meta="false" speaker="Zeba Khan" start="4831">Yeah, so do those ones, as do those ones.</p><p end="4952" is_meta="false" speaker="Douglas Murray" start="4831">So I think this gets back to the very important question the lady halfway back there made which is whether or not this can be a religion of peace. I believe it can be, and when I said earlier there are three types of Islam I identified. There's the first one, the scriptures,</p><p end="4952" is_meta="false" speaker="Douglas Murray" start="4831">the light from Mohammad and so on, bad. Second one, Sharia interpretations, bad. But,</p><p end="4952" is_meta="false" speaker="Douglas Murray" start="4831">thirdly, the way Muslims live their lives today in this country and countries like it, that is our source for hope, and the source of hope for that is they individually use -- like many people do really, I'm not a religious person. Ayaan isn't either. But we recognize the fact that people of religious faith have the right to that faith, should practice that faith, should have no fear of practicing that faith. There's no problem with it. But it's a private matter,</p><p end="4952" is_meta="false" speaker="Douglas Murray" start="4831">and one which people come to very strange private arrangements about.</p><p end="5071" is_meta="false" speaker="Douglas Murray" start="4952">And I just wanted to add this, which is that if those people are going to be able to reform that faith into a religion of peace you&#8217;re talking about. Then, yes, we would be the first people to encourage that. But if we&#8217;re going to have that debate, as I hope we&#8217;ve shown tonight, it has to start with honesty.</p><p end="5071" is_meta="true" speaker="Douglas Murray" start="4952">talking simultaneously</p><p end="5071" is_meta="false" speaker="Ayaan Hirsi Ali" start="4952">That kind of profiling is allowed.</p><p end="5071" is_meta="false" speaker="Douglas Murray" start="4952">Jihad Jane was blonde.</p><p end="5071" is_meta="false" speaker="Douglas Murray" start="4952">John Donvan:All right. I&#8217;m going to take someone from the left. Yes, blond person, you can go.</p><p end="5071" is_meta="false" speaker="Douglas Murray" start="4952">Anybody from the -- yeah, okay. Okay, go ahead. And then on the right side, yes. Okay.</p><p end="5071" is_meta="false" speaker="Douglas Murray" start="4952">Ma&#8217;am, I see you. Yep. And again, remember the way that great question was phrased?</p><p end="5071" is_meta="false" speaker="Douglas Murray" start="4952">That&#8217;s how you do it.</p><p end="5191" is_meta="false" speaker="Ayaan Hirsi Ali" start="5071">But then Catholicism went through the reformation and enlightenment.</p><p end="5434" is_meta="false" speaker="Maajid Nawaz" start="5309">Well, actually, to be honest, I value a can of Diet Coke more than a hymen. I mean,</p><p end="5434" is_meta="false" speaker="Maajid Nawaz" start="5309">really, everything's more valuable to me than a hymen, and especially a woman. So I really don't understand the point of your question there. But allow me to say, however,</p><p end="5434" is_meta="false" speaker="Maajid Nawaz" start="5309">that every Muslim questioner from the audience today is not a true Muslim. And every one of you may be a Christian is not really a Christian. And any of you who may be a Jew is not really a Jew, because I have the absolute monopoly of defining all three of those religions for all of you. And, really, the passages that -- I'm saying this because of the first question. And that is, the passages that were referred to about fight them wherever you see them. Now, the thing is really, the founding fathers of this great country who wrote the Constitution believed in slavery and were practicing slavery.</p><p end="5434" is_meta="false" speaker="Maajid Nawaz" start="5309">Now, does that mean that we're going to define the whole of America and its Constitution by that practice, or are we going to contextualize that practice and say that when they founded this country, slavery sand abolishing slavery was not at the forefront of their minds, but later on, it was abolished, and that's an achievement for this country. It's not something that defines this country.</p><p end="5434" is_meta="false" speaker="Maajid Nawaz" start="5309">And so likewise these passages, yes, they can be used, and they are used in a problematic way. And it's our responsibility, not just as Muslims, but as decent human beings, to go out there and challenge the abuse of these passages. But we must not forget that as if with every other document in history, it had its context, and it was abused.</p><p end="5549" is_meta="false" speaker="Maajid Nawaz" start="5434">And now when we have gone ex post facto, we can look back to that and judge it with a very civilized standard that we've arrived at and say that was wrong. Now, perhaps --</p><p end="5549" is_meta="false" speaker="Maajid Nawaz" start="5434">I may be defined [unintelligible].</p><p end="5549" is_meta="true" speaker="Zeba Khan" start="5434">unintelligible</p><p end="5549" is_meta="false" speaker="Zeba Khan" start="5434">So how do I interpret is what you're asking. Despite what our opposition says, I do have that right. And basically, I look at my faith -- I'm sorry. Who asked the question? I look at my faith and the way I was raised with core Islamic principles, which is how my family raised me, and that I determined as an adult were correct, which is compassion and tolerance and plurality and strength and diversity, because we are a diverse population. There are as many interpretations of Islam as there are people. And so the other point I want to make to that is that there are clergy and clerics who do stress this. I mean, if you look at 2005 at the Imam Message, where 200 Muslim scholars from 50 countries addressed a reemphasis of Islam's core values of compassion, mutual respect,</p><p end="5549" is_meta="false" speaker="Zeba Khan" start="5434">acceptance, freedom of religion. There is precedent for this not just for me as a layperson but from the clergy as well, to reassert these lost -- in some areas, lost values.</p><p end="5549" is_meta="false" speaker="Douglas Murray" start="5434">This is a very, very complex one. But it has to be said. Maajid has just given the comparison of the founding fathers, and there has to be some clarity about this. This country rightly reveres your founding fathers. But you don't think that their word was immutable or unchangeable.</p><p end="5549" is_meta="false" speaker="Zeba Khan" start="5434">No.</p><p end="5549" is_meta="false" speaker="Douglas Murray" start="5434">You don't believe -- I don't know. I don't think that anyone in this room who criticized Mr. Jefferson now here tonight, will be declared an anti-American apostate who can be fit for slaughter.</p><p end="5671" is_meta="false" speaker="Douglas Murray" start="5549">The problem that our opponents have to address, they have to address it, is that a religion which is based on the idea that the Koran was dictated direct by God to Mohammad andthat therefore if you are criticizing the Koran or throwing out a bit or pulling it apart, like most Christians and Jews -- most Christians and Jews have come to that stage where pretty much you pick a mix with your holy scriptures. And it's quite a good, humane way around it. But with Islam, if this is the revealed word of God, revealed, it has to be said,</p><p end="5671" is_meta="false" speaker="Douglas Murray" start="5549">as it was shown again earlier tonight in a particularly obscure and unreadable dialect,</p><p end="5671" is_meta="false" speaker="Douglas Murray" start="5549">which -- if it was meant to be understood by the whole of the world, it's a bad place to start. If this were the case, then, as I say, we come back to this problem. Founding fathers did -- said many great things and did some bad things. But you are not committed as Americans not to criticize the bad things they did. And this is a problem our opponents are going to have address.</p><p end="5671" is_meta="false" speaker="Ayaan Hirsi Ali" start="5549">Islam is not a religion of peace. And I woke up to the facts on the 11th of September,</p><p end="5671" is_meta="false" speaker="Ayaan Hirsi Ali" start="5549">2001. Perhaps I should have woken up to the facts earlier. But I admit that I did that then at that time. Talking to people of my faith, Islam, and my friends, and discussing with them, I remember all kind of fallacious arguments.</p><p end="5790" is_meta="false" speaker="Ayaan Hirsi Ali" start="5671">But I remember one consistent thing, and that was to exempt Islam from any criticism. It was culture. It wasn't Islam. But a religion is born in a culture. And if that culture is not peaceful, then that religion is not peaceful. I was told it's politics. We've heard it tonight many times. It's not religion. But Islam not only has a pious dimension but it also has a political dimension, a complex system of laws, a political philosophy on how society should be organized. And if you look at that political system, it's anything but peaceful.</p><p end="5790" is_meta="false" speaker="Ayaan Hirsi Ali" start="5671">What emancipated me from the order to submit my will completely to Allah, which in practice means the concentration of power in the hands of a few, was to learn to think critically, the enlightenment.</p><p end="5790" is_meta="false" speaker="Ayaan Hirsi Ali" start="5671">Vote against this motion and open up the flaws of Islam for debate in order that Muslims,</p><p end="5790" is_meta="false" speaker="Ayaan Hirsi Ali" start="5671">those who are not yet emancipated, may take charge of their own reason, of their ownfaculty. Vote against the motion that Islam is a religion of peace and toss -- toss that fallacy into the trashcan of history. Thank you.</p><p end="5790" is_meta="false" speaker="Zeba Khan" start="5671">Thank you. Faisal Shahzad, the underwear bomber, and the group of young men that were picked up in Pakistan, all of them were for violence and trying to attack our country and learning how to attack our country elsewhere.</p><p end="5911" is_meta="false" speaker="Zeba Khan" start="5790">But the one thing that the media consistently forgets to mention or conveniently forgets to mention is who turned all of them in. It was Muslims. It was their families, because that is a Koranic principle, that you stand up for justice, even if it's against yourself. And in this case, someone's son or several people's sons, the underwear bomber's father who was Nigerian and not American, did this, turned him in, and sent word to the authorities. And a Senegalese merchant was one of the first unreported, but was one of the first people to see the Times Square attempted bomber.</p><p end="5911" is_meta="false" speaker="Zeba Khan" start="5790">Our opponents have a very simplistic outlook on this -- on the world and what's currently at stake. They see it being Islam versus the West. But the truth is it's not. It's between moderates and extremists of all kinds. And I urge you to vote for the motion because the overwhelming majority of Muslims, the facts are clear, they are peaceful, they're mainstream, and they condemn violence against civilians and have no interest in terrorism, which is consistently as the woman in the audience said, are attacking Muslims, mainstream Muslims every day, brutally, and oppressing them because we don't accept their version of Islam. I'm asking for your help for -- as other people, as people of reason and of people of a moderate voice to support us as we fight them and we are fighting them, although we don't hear it as often in the media, which focuses on violence and fear. But the fact is, Muslims have always been fighting them.</p><p end="5911" is_meta="false" speaker="Zeba Khan" start="5790">Thank you.</p><p end="6029" is_meta="false" speaker="Douglas Murray" start="5911">Thank you. Well, thank you for a very enlightening, I think, debate tonight. I think we on this side made it very clear that we don&#8217;t think there's a fight between Islam and the West or Islam and civilization or anything else like that. We've made a very clear set of points tonight, and one of those points, which I hope people bear in mind, is we have said repeatedly that it is in Muslims and their critical faculties, Muslims and their behavior,</p><p end="6029" is_meta="false" speaker="Douglas Murray" start="5911">Muslims and their faith that we have hope. And it is in people like you that we have hope for the future, and if the motion were that Islam a century from now could be a religion of peace and people would be quoting Zeba and Maajid and seminal moments like this and that they had learned -- well, that would be terrific, but at the moment, tonight, you're being asked to vote on whether Islam is now a religion of peace, is Islam a religion of peace? I think it is very clear that it is not. This does not mean -- of course, it doesn't mean that Muslims are all violent. We would never make that point. We never have made that point, nor does it mean that there isn't hope in the future, nor does it mean that we have to have continual clashes until the end of time, but it means we have to start by being honest. We have to be frank about what we see in Islamic history, in Islamic conquests, and in Islamic script. We have to be frank about that.</p><p end="6029" is_meta="false" speaker="Douglas Murray" start="5911">In societies which Islam dominated, conquered, and subdued the peoples in the Middle Ages, people who were not Muslim were sometimes allowed to remain in those societies but they were allowed to do so only by having second class status. I would ask you tonight, ladies and gentlemen, not to be dhimmis, not to have second-class status, not to vote for things because you think it's polite or because you think you have to say them but because you think they're true. On that basis, the idea you could vote for the motion tonight is absurd. Islam is palpably, demonstrably, evidently not a religion of peace.</p><p end="6029" is_meta="false" speaker="Douglas Murray" start="5911">Vote against this motion. Thank you.</p><p end="6152" is_meta="false" speaker="Maajid Nawaz" start="6029">Thank you. Right. So I'm not going to ask you to be polite. I would dread to think that that's why you'd vote for the motion. In fact, what I'd like to do is give you four reasons to vote -- basically four reasons why the panel's arguments are incorrect and four reasons then to vote for the motion. And as for the failure of the panel, I think number one is that there's a failure to contextualize. As I've tried to say time and time again, there's a failure to contextualize history and texts and sources, and there's an intellectual suspension that occurs when discussing Islam that simply doesn't occur when discussing the Constitution or any other piece of literature or writing. Secondly, there's a failure to disclose. And as we've heard from the panel, both of them -- and there's nothing wrong with this, by the way -- both of them are not believers of any faith, and that's their perfect right to do so,</p><p end="6152" is_meta="false" speaker="Maajid Nawaz" start="6029">but they've made it clear their real agenda is with all religions. And I think we have to be honest with ourselves, that actually religions can and have historically played much good and have come to much good in the world, including the Reformation despite the fact we have to contextualize it. Thirdly, there's a failure to nuance, and as we've heard, gross generalizations about Islam by quoting isolated passages are being made. And fourthly there's a failure to be honest. And that honesty is in refusing to recognize that a vast majority of Muslims where there have been democratic elections have refused to turn in the extremists, as the examples I've cited in Bangladesh and Pakistan.</p><p end="6152" is_meta="false" speaker="Maajid Nawaz" start="6029">Now, please vote for the motion, and the reason I'd say that is reclaim Islam, don't let the minority hijack it. Yes, even for those of you who are not Muslims, reclaim it, because it's a faith like all other faiths that does need to be redefined in current times. Secondly,</p><p end="6152" is_meta="false" speaker="Maajid Nawaz" start="6029">vote for peace. This is not a vote for Islam. It's a vote for peace. And I'm sure all of us want peace. And thirdly I'd say help the confused Muslims in the world, the factions, the minority, the young minds, like I was, who are confused, help them make up their minds by giving them guidance, by giving them an olive branch and voting for peace tonight.</p><p end="6280" is_meta="false" speaker="Maajid Nawaz" start="6152">And finally, I&#8217;d say that even if you&#8217;re unsure, even if you think that Islam is not a religion for peace, I would ask all of you hear tonight to vote as we heard the admission from the panel, it can be a religion of peace, so vote for what you&#8217;d like Islam to be.</p><p end="6280" is_meta="true" speaker="Maajid Nawaz" start="6152">laughter and applause</p><p end="6280" is_meta="false" speaker="Maajid Nawaz" start="6152">If you&#8217;d like Islam to be a religion of peace, then vote for it.</p><p end="6280" is_meta="true" speaker="Maajid Nawaz" start="6152">applause</p><p end="6280" is_meta="true" speaker="Ayaan Hirsi Ali" start="6152">inaudible</p></transcript></debate>
