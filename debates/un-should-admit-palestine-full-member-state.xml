Skepticism is healthy. But we can't pretend the Palestinians away.</p><p end="420" is_meta="false" speaker="Daniel Levy" start="364">And time isn't healing this. So not acting to facilitate the Palestinian state is just a dereliction of responsibility to ourselves and to future generations.</p><p end="485" is_meta="false" speaker="Dore Gold" start="420">I'm sorry. I have to correct you. I'm currently not an advisor. I'm a private citizen. But nonetheless, I'll answer your question.</p><p end="485" is_meta="false" speaker="Dore Gold" start="420">Have to ask him. Look, the position I am taking has nothing to do with recognition of the Palestinians. It has nothing to do with national dignity, which every people is entitled to. It has everything to do with undertaking an act which will create chaos,</p><p end="485" is_meta="false" speaker="Dore Gold" start="420">precisely at a time when the Middle East is more dangerous than ever.</p><p end="605" is_meta="false" speaker="Daniel Levy" start="539">Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, on October 10, 1971, the United Nations admitted the People's Republic of China as a member and kicked out Taiwan. If that were the kind of motion we were debating tonight, I would not be standing here arguing in favor.</p><p end="668" is_meta="false" speaker="Daniel Levy" start="605">What we are proposing is to admit Palestine at the U.N. not instead of Israel but alongside Israel, unfinished U.N. business from the middle of the last century. Let me first clear up what I hope will not become debris in the way of constructive debate tonight. We have not convened here to discuss matters of legal principle, "Does Palestine meet the criteria of Montevideo for statehood?" Law matters, but this isprimarily a political, not a legal question. And it's not about the United Nations and whether it is a force for good or a frustrating institution. It can be both, and Israel of course went to the U.N. to get its own birth certificate endorsed. But the assumption of this debate is the two-state paradigm. We do not have anyone here advocating a greater Jewish Israel or a binational democratic state, nevertheless, it would be hubris to take two states for granted, and we need to recognize certain realities.</p><p end="728" is_meta="false" speaker="Daniel Levy" start="668">The territorial viability of a second state in this area looks increasingly precarious.</p><p end="728" is_meta="false" speaker="Daniel Levy" start="668">Approximately 600,000 Israelis, one in 10 Israeli Jews live beyond the green line.</p><p end="728" is_meta="false" speaker="Daniel Levy" start="668">Settlements grow. Outposts are legalized. I invite you to go and see the reality. And it's not just a physical manifestation of blurring. It is also the conceptual universe in which a growing number of Israelis live. Prime Minister Netanyahu may have talked the talk on two states, but he has not walked the walk. His own Likud party platform opposes two states, and one must take seriously the Jewish-Israeli narrative that says 100 years ago we had nothing, then we got Balfour, then we got the '47 partition, then we got 78 percent of the land, then in 1967 we got 100 percent of the land, and we're not going anywhere.</p><p end="779" is_meta="false" speaker="Daniel Levy" start="728">That's a serious view, and it has an amen corner, by the way, certain people perhaps in New Hampshire tonight's part of that amen corner. Passivity cannot be the response. If we want two states, we have to act. And U.N. admission for Palestine is precisely the anchor for a two-state future, a clarifying moment. We need to be deeply respectful of the choices that Israelis are going to have to make, difficult choices, and the conversations in Israel, and, therefore, to understand just how unproductive the lack of clarity is for that Israeli conversation. Indulging bad behavior, treating that with impunity, is unhelpful in any human predicament.</p><p end="844" is_meta="false" speaker="Daniel Levy" start="779">And we encourage the most self destructive tendencies in Israeli behavior when we pretend that by doing nothing, allowing this slippage away from two states, somehow we're making it easier for Israeli society to change course. We are not. The cost benefit calculation of Israelis needs to look different. Do we really think that Israel is waiting to leave the territory, it's just waiting, and the Palestinians just need to ask politely enough and behave well enough, and that's the key to unlock this? Let's acknowledge that it's not going to be easy but the current policies aren't helping. What, then, can be done?</p><p end="844" is_meta="false" speaker="Daniel Levy" start="779">The Palestinians do actually have options, violence. I'm against that. That's illegitimate.</p><p end="844" is_meta="false" speaker="Daniel Levy" start="779">They can use nonviolence, coercive diplomacy of sanctioning. I can see its legitimacy,</p><p end="844" is_meta="false" speaker="Daniel Levy" start="779">but I'm not an advocate of that. Or they can use declarative diplomacy, draw a line, lay down a marker to get the attention of Israelis.</p><p end="905" is_meta="false" speaker="Daniel Levy" start="844">That's what U.N. membership is, and I would argue it correlates with what is best,</p><p end="905" is_meta="false" speaker="Daniel Levy" start="844">therefore, for Israel. We can't expect the Palestinians to wait forever, and we can't say to them that you can neither have self-determination and express it at the U.N. but nor can you accept the one-state reality and argue for equal rights in one state. Suggesting the Palestinians can do neither is unrealistic, but it's also immoral. So if we want to salvage a two-state solution but at the same time if we can't impose a solution and if we can't even prevent deterioration, if we can't even get a settlement freeze, then how do we give oxygen to this gasping for breath two-state idea? We vote to admit Palestine to the U.N. and we vote for this motion tonight. U.N. membership is not a silver bullet. It&#8217;s not a panacea. It&#8217;s not sprinkling pixie dust on the harsh realities of the Middle East.</p><p end="965" is_meta="false" speaker="Daniel Levy" start="905">But it is an important and legitimate part of a strategy to signal a different future. We will no doubt be told that this can&#8217;t happen, that it&#8217;s meaningless symbolism, and especially not now with the Arab spring. Wrong. Yes, the U.S. has committed to a veto.</p><p end="965" is_meta="false" speaker="Daniel Levy" start="905">No doubt, we&#8217;ll discuss that. But does that make this debate pointless? Can the realpolitik argument really close down our entire conversation? If that&#8217;s the case, I strongly suggest you guys cancel the debate you have planned in March about banning college football, because it won&#8217;t be. And that can always be an argument. I urge the other side of this debate to give us more than naysaying, to give us more than negotiations. Those negotiations are asymmetrical. One side is so lacking in leverage and they are so steeped in years of failure. Negotiations cannot be the singular tool in our toolkit.</p><p end="1023" is_meta="false" speaker="Daniel Levy" start="965">And finally, if we are concerned about Israel&#8217;s security, then let&#8217;s acknowledge that hope too is a security currently. Hopelessness encourages violence. There will always be the next mountain range that you need to occupy, but strategic security is about a basket of interests and balances and avoiding casus belli. And perhaps, perhaps, occupation itself contributes to insecurity and Israeli democracy. Eventually managing an occupation and justifying it and sustaining democracy cannot happily coexist. Not to dramatize, but if we don&#8217;t have a Palestine, we are saying Kaddish. We are saying the right of prayer, of last prayer for Israeli democracy. I urge you to support this motion, to support the principle of Palestine alongside Israel at the U.N. Thank you.</p><p end="1090" is_meta="false" speaker="Aaron David Miller" start="1023">John, thank you very much. And thank all of you for coming. Daniel, I&#8217;ve known you for many years. I admire your passion and your intellect. You&#8217;re a powerful advocate of Israeli-Palestinian peace, of logic and common sense. All of this, however, does not address the fundamental problem, the conundrum now, Daniel. We&#8217;re dealing with a conundrum. We are stuck. Violence will never produce sovereignty for Palestinians, but neither will negotiations right now. So the question is what to do. What you are suggesting, in my judgment, is that we take an action that is not simply neutral, that will retard and undermine the very concept as dubious as you may believe it is.</p><p end="1156" is_meta="false" speaker="Aaron David Miller" start="1090">And Mustafa will agree. Dore may even agree. It is simply no justification for proceeding in the face of common sense logic toward an alternative that ultimately will not bring Palestinians closer to meaningful sovereignty. I speak here not as an Israeli to you and not as a Palestinian. I speak with all its imperfections and contradictions as an American, absorbed in this process for many years, 25 years. And during the course of that period, I developed a faith in three primary assumptions: Number one, there was a solution, equitable and durable; number two, negotiations were the only way to achieve it. And negotiations is flawed and it&#8217;s imperfect because it&#8217;s based on human frailty and weakness and on the need and the capacity to compromise; and finally, that the United States had a critical role to play in this process by being fair, by being tough and by being reassuring -- all of these assumptions.</p><p end="1203" is_meta="false" speaker="Aaron David Miller" start="1156">Any honest man or woman would acknowledge [unintelligible]. And the situation,</p><p end="1203" is_meta="false" speaker="Aaron David Miller" start="1156">you&#8217;re quite correct, Dan, it will be worse. It will get worse before it gets worse. But the question still has to be addressed. How will granting the putative state of Palestine admission as a full-member state into the U.N. address any of this? Now, I&#8217;m here to argue in six basic points. I don&#8217;t want to bore you. I&#8217;m not here to entertain you, but to leave you with perhaps a baker&#8217;s dozen in the next four-and-a-half minutes of why I believe this is a bad idea. And, by the way, I concede, particularly to you, Daniel, that I know bad ideas when I see them.</p><p end="1264" is_meta="false" speaker="Aaron David Miller" start="1203">I know illusions when I see them. I was responsible, over the course of a 20-year period,</p><p end="1264" is_meta="false" speaker="Aaron David Miller" start="1203">for quite a few, as Mustafa will attest, perhaps even Dore. But not tonight. I have no illusions tonight. First, as an American whose country sits on the Security Council, I cannot, in all good conscience, recommend the admission of a putative state however morally or ethically compelling it may be as a full member state. Prime Minister Salam Fayyad, the man who has done more to build institutions of Palestinian statehood on the ground is against this proposition because he knows it'll undermine the work that he has done. It'll undermine the institutions. Palestine has no borders. It has no control over its population. It has no monopoly over the forces of violence within its own society. In short, it does not control the guns, all of the guns in its society. I would argue that's critically important for statehood.</p><p end="1339" is_meta="false" speaker="Aaron David Miller" start="1264">Yes, much of this may be due to the Israeli occupation. But that doesn't change the reality. Admission of Palestine now will create a situation in which it cannot discharge its own obligations as a member state, in large part because half of its government, the rival Palestinian national movement doesn't ascribe to a peaceful solution of interstate conflicts. Mustafa may have much to say about this, but this is an obligation of UN membership. Second, as an American, I'd oppose this because I believe it's not symbolic.</p><p end="1339" is_meta="false" speaker="Aaron David Miller" start="1264">It's not symbolic at all. It's a prescription, and an RX, if you will, for instability and perhaps even escalation. Think about it. We are admitting the Palestinian authority that presumes to control Palestine into the UN when in fact two other entities, one, the state of Israel, an ally of the United States, and the second factor and force, Hamas, an entity which is an adversary of the United States, has more control over what transpires in Palestine, this putative state than the Palestinian authority.</p><p end="1384" is_meta="false" speaker="Aaron David Miller" start="1339">That is a prescription for endless contradictions and perhaps even violence. Mustafa will tell you, and he may be right, that the basis for this negotiation, and the basis of --</p><p end="1384" is_meta="false" speaker="Aaron David Miller" start="1339">for any Palestinian state will be June 4, '67 borders. But admitting Palestine into the UN will mean that a Palestinian president not only has the right and the obligation to defend those borders. I wouldn't want -- I mean, maybe you see this as a blessing. I see it as a huge contradiction, to put any head of a putative state in a position where he has to defend borders that he cannot defend. And what is he to say to his public when the Israelis continue to do what they will do?</p><p end="1448" is_meta="false" speaker="Aaron David Miller" start="1384">Which brings me to my third point. There will be an Israeli reaction. And who is going to control that reaction? The United States? The international community? As Israel seeks perhaps to set its own boundaries, to basically say to the Palestinians, fine, youhave now set your boundaries. June 4, '67, is the basis of a negotiation if we ever return to the table. But we're going to set ours now as well. We will set our boundaries. And we will be dragged sooner rather than later away from the prospect of any kind of solution. For, if the Palestinians want to pick a fight with the Americans, that's their business. But I would argue it's counterproductive. You're going to have an election in November. And I'm not talking as a Republican or as a Democrat. But anybody looking at this situation might argue that if you truly had a strategic interest in promoting Palestinian statehood, you probably would want to see the re-election of the current president.</p><p end="1503" is_meta="false" speaker="Aaron David Miller" start="1448">You would probably want to see the re-election of the current president, which would mean essentially that you're not going to force him into a position to take action that will weaken the prospects of his own election. Finally, I'll come back to my initial point.</p><p end="1503" is_meta="false" speaker="Aaron David Miller" start="1448">Just because we're stuck does not mean the pursuit of a strategy that's going to take us farther away than ever from our goal. Admission of Palestine now without an agreement will take Palestinians farther away from sovereignty.</p><p end="1562" is_meta="false" speaker="Mustafa Barghouthi" start="1503">Thank you so much. And thank you for coming tonight, and thank you for inviting me to this debate. I have four reasons that I would like to emphasize why Palestine should be admitted to the UN. The first is that time is not an infinite commodity. And time --</p><p end="1562" is_meta="false" speaker="Mustafa Barghouthi" start="1503">we're losing time. And with the continuation of Israeli settlements on the ground,which are illegal, and after 20 years of failed negotiations, we cannot have the risk of losing the two-state solution.</p><p end="1623" is_meta="false" speaker="Mustafa Barghouthi" start="1562">If Palestine is not accepted as a state very soon, there will be no two-state solution. And the outcome will be dangerous and bad for everybody. So we need the UN in this case to change the parameters, to change the course, the course of failure which Mr. Miller is defending. What Mr. Miller has suggested and what probably Mr. Gold will suggest is to continue the same path of failure, the same negotiation that's failed to produce anything because of the imbalance. What -- and that, in my opinion, is irresponsible towards Palestinians and irresponsible towards Israelis as well. What they are proposing is to continue what Einstein described as insanity, which is doing the same thing over and over again and expect different results.</p><p end="1623" is_meta="true" speaker="Mustafa Barghouthi" start="1562">applause</p><p end="1697" is_meta="false" speaker="Mustafa Barghouthi" start="1623">Third, it also indicates, as I suspect Mr. Gold will show, such a position against UN admission indicates an underlying intention of rejecting the principle of having a Palestinian state, which means rejecting the right of the Palestinian people to be free.</p><p end="1697" is_meta="false" speaker="Mustafa Barghouthi" start="1623">Continuing negotiations while settlements continue to grow is like having two sides negotiating over a piece of cheese. One side, the Palestinian side, is stuck behind bars.</p><p end="1697" is_meta="false" speaker="Mustafa Barghouthi" start="1623">The Israeli side having access to the piece of cheese and eating it while negotiating. At the end of the day, we'll find nothing to negotiate about. And that is not a solution. So my second point is that in the light of the failure of the disability and inability of the United States for internal reasons that are well-known to you, and in the light of the weakness of the Europeans and their participation, and in the light of the stubbornness of the Israeli extreme right wing, we have to find a way for a new strategy.</p><p end="1740" is_meta="false" speaker="Mustafa Barghouthi" start="1697">We have one of three options. Either Palestinians would surrender to injustice, and that's what some people are calling for. In this case, what you will witness is the consolidation of a system of apartheid, where Palestinians are discriminated against.</p><p end="1740" is_meta="false" speaker="Mustafa Barghouthi" start="1697">And Israel would become the worst apartheid system in the 21st century, something that nobody could be proud about. Or the second option is violence, which we reject,</p><p end="1740" is_meta="false" speaker="Mustafa Barghouthi" start="1697">and we don't want. The third option is to have nonviolence, peaceful resistance, exactly like Gandhi did in India, and like Martin Luther King did here in the United States. And that's the course we are taking.</p><p end="1808" is_meta="false" speaker="Mustafa Barghouthi" start="1740">And that's why going to the UN is nothing but another act of diplomatic resistance within the context of popular nonviolent resistance to change parameters and to change the balance of power so that we can have productive negotiations really and have a result at the end of the road. My third point is that, supposing our right to be admitted to the United Nations will be sending the right message, the message of respect to human rights, the message of respect to people's right for self-determination, the message of respect of the right of people to be sovereign. If we speak about the right of people in South Sudan and in Kosovo and in Libya and in Syria to be free and to have self-determination, then why not Palestine? And why continue to use the double standard, especially that admitting Palestine in the UN would be about correcting a historical mistake that was made. Since 1947 resolution the United States spoke about two states, Israel was established.</p><p end="1866" is_meta="false" speaker="Mustafa Barghouthi" start="1808">Palestine was not. My last point is that we know that admitting Palestine to the United Nations would not immediately create a change on the ground. We understand, but it will achieve three goals. First, it will give us hope. It will give Palestinians hope. Hope is what we need today to sustain a nonviolent approach to our resistance and struggle.</p><p end="1866" is_meta="false" speaker="Mustafa Barghouthi" start="1808">Desperation and lack of hope as is advocated on the other side will only bring violence and dangerous things. Second, accepting Palestine will actually invalidate all the de facto actions on the ground that are made by Israel and by creating settlements. And,</p><p end="1866" is_meta="false" speaker="Mustafa Barghouthi" start="1808">third, it will send a message to the Israelis that they will not be really free unless Palestinians are also free.</p><p end="1920" is_meta="false" speaker="Mustafa Barghouthi" start="1866">We are now victims of oppression and discrimination. The Israelis are hostage to occupation and fear, especially security fear. And Mr. Gold will try to show you that there is more fear today because of the Arab Spring. Instead of Israel being happy about people becoming democratic, they are having more fear. This is not the right approach. We want to liberate ourselves through popular nonviolent resistance through admission to the United Nations, but we also want to liberate the Israelis as well. Martin Luther King liberated the United States, not only the African-Americans,</p><p end="1920" is_meta="false" speaker="Mustafa Barghouthi" start="1866">from segregation as well as Mandela liberated the whole of South Africa, the whites and the blacks together by liberating South Africa from apartheid.</p><p end="1980" is_meta="false" speaker="Mustafa Barghouthi" start="1920">And that's why what we want, what we are working for, is to liberate ourselves from oppression, the longest occupation in modern history, and the worst apartheid system,</p><p end="1980" is_meta="false" speaker="Mustafa Barghouthi" start="1920">and to liberate the Israelis from fear, from the security phobia. One time a Palestinian leader came to the United Nations with a gun and an olive branch. Today we arecoming to the United Nations with two olive branches. Don't let us drop them. Thank you.</p><p end="2041" is_meta="false" speaker="Dore Gold" start="1980">Those of you who are voting tonight should remember that we're speaking about Palestinian membership at the U.N., we're not in New Hampshire. When I served as Israel's ambassador to the United Nations back in the late 1990s, I had a colleague, a counterpart, who was the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, became a very close friend, it's someone I intellectually admired. His name, unfortunately he's passed away,</p><p end="2041" is_meta="false" speaker="Dore Gold" start="1980">was Richard Holbrooke. And one of the things I was struck by, before I was sent to the U.N. I was the Israeli negotiator. I was sent to the sand dunes of Gaza where Muhammad [unintelligible] picked me up in that extended Mercedes and take me to Arafat's house. We would discuss how to move forward in peace, and, by the way,</p><p end="2041" is_meta="false" speaker="Dore Gold" start="1980">those discussions were tough because he -- when you're in a meeting like that, you don't know where to park your head.</p><p end="2112" is_meta="false" speaker="Dore Gold" start="2041">Should you remember the Israelis who died in repeated suicide terrorist attacks that came out of territory under Arafat's jurisdiction? I know that's tough to mention, but you've got to know that. Do you think of those people? Do you think about the moment? Do you think about building a future? Do you forget about the tragedies of the past so you'll have hope? How do you orient yourself? It's very, very tough. But I had that experience. We were involved in -- I spent hours with Mahmoud Abbas, Abu Mazen. I spent a tremendous time on the Hebron Agreement with Aaron and of course the Wye Agreement that followed afterwards. And what I had seen in the '90s is that we didn't succeed. We didn't succeed. We reached agreements. And, by the way, the man that some spokesmen like to try and put in the corner Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu signed two agreements with the Palestinians -- withdrew from territory,made sacrifices for peace, risked his whole political base because he wanted to move the process forward.</p><p end="2161" is_meta="false" speaker="Dore Gold" start="2112">It may not be the conventional wisdom in certain circles, but I experienced that. But let me go back to Holbrooke. So I saw that we had a tough time moving forward. And after I left government in 1999 and when Mr. Ehud Barak came into office. And Barak went to Camp David with Yasser Arafat. The peace wasn&#8217;t concluded. But I asked myself through my contacts with Holbrooke, &#8220;How was it?&#8221; And Richard Holbrooke delivered the greatest political diplomatic achievement of the Clinton administration, the Dayton Accords over Bosnia. Well, we didn&#8217;t succeed in the Middle East. We failed at Camp David. I&#8217;m not sure I still understand why that occurred.</p><p end="2225" is_meta="false" speaker="Dore Gold" start="2161">By the way, that is a tough conflict, the battle between Croats, Bosnian Muslims, the Serbs, was religious, ethnic, territorial. It had all the ingredients that we had. But they persisted. They persisted to negotiate. I discerned from my discussions with Holbrooke and from reading his memoirs on that conflict that there were three elements. He concluded that there must be a negotiated outcome. As much as you could be cynical about tough negotiations, that&#8217;s the only outcome that will work. The second thing that comes from my experience with talking to him and also in his memoirs is that peacemaking must come from the parties themselves. The great breakthroughs of Dayton came from those three warring parties. It&#8217;s true. They were brought to Ohio.</p><p end="2225" is_meta="false" speaker="Dore Gold" start="2161">It&#8217;s true. Secretary of State was in and out. President Clinton was ready to come in.</p><p end="2290" is_meta="false" speaker="Dore Gold" start="2225">But they themselves were responsible for reaching peace and imperfect peace. And finally, you need diplomatic flexibility. Let me tell you something. Both sides, certainly in our case -- I can speak to Israelis -- we have a deep inner conviction in the justice of our cause. But tonight&#8217;s not the night to lay that out to you. The point is that even though you have that deep inner conviction, the point is that even though you can go on every American network from CNN to FOX Television and lay that out to the American audience, you have got to make a compromise. You&#8217;ve got to cut a deal. You can&#8217;t walk away. And because they knew there had to be a negotiated outcome, because they knew it had to come from the parties themselves and the needed diplomatic flexibility,</p><p end="2290" is_meta="false" speaker="Dore Gold" start="2225">in the Balkans, they cut a deal, an imperfect deal.</p><p end="2342" is_meta="false" speaker="Dore Gold" start="2290">In fact, Holbrooke writes in his book the critical question: Will the Bosnians grasp an imperfect peace or let the war resumed remain unresolved right up until Dayton wasconvened? Now, let me move to the issue at hand between us. What is my problem with the proposal that a Palestinian state be recognized as a U.N. member state? As I said in my opening words, this isn&#8217;t about national dignity. You know, every people wants to recognized. And there are a lot of peoples out there beyond the discussion of who&#8217;s supposed to get independence -- Kurds, Tibetans, you name it -- every national movement wants to be recognized to the U.N. So my question isn&#8217;t about recognizing the rights of Palestinians.</p><p end="2401" is_meta="false" speaker="Dore Gold" start="2342">That [unintelligible] was recognized by Menachem Begin back at Camp David in 1978.</p><p end="2401" is_meta="false" speaker="Dore Gold" start="2342">My question is really twofold, and my concern is twofold. First of all, carefully listening to the speech of Mahmoud Abbas on September 23rd this year, or last year now, at the U.N. General Assembly, he wasn&#8217;t just saying, &#8220;Accept us in principle.&#8221; He was laying out borders. And I think Aaron made the reference to it, the June 4, 1967 line, as though there was some kind of pre-&#8217;67 boundary, border, that was an international line that we have to agree to. That&#8217;s it. When we signed the Oslo Agreements, borders were supposed to be negotiated. And that -- to that point, to that very point, Yasser Arafat agreed. He signed those agreements.</p><p end="2461" is_meta="false" speaker="Dore Gold" start="2401">Or actually Abu Mazen signed the first agreement. The implement agreements, he later signed. So we're talking about predetermining the final boundaries by moving to the UN.</p><p end="2580" is_meta="false" speaker="Dore Gold" start="2524">I mentioned that point already, which is, of course, that these are issues that have to be negotiated. You know, for example, one of the hard choices that Mahmoud Abbas has to face, one of the critical issues that he has to deal with is announcing, it's the end of the conflict. By going to the UN, getting a Palestinian state, he doesn't have to do that.</p><p end="2580" is_meta="false" speaker="Dore Gold" start="2524">He doesn't have to come to terms with the question that we keep raising. We're being asked, recognize the rights of the Palestinians to an independent state. So we've done that. But we're asking the Palestinians to recognize the right of the Jewish people to a nation state of their own. That has to be in the package.</p><p end="2580" is_meta="true" speaker="Dore Gold" start="2524">applause</p><p end="2580" is_meta="false" speaker="Dore Gold" start="2524">But in fact, there -- there --</p><p end="2580" is_meta="false" speaker="Mustafa Barghouthi" start="2524">But how are you recognizing the Palestinian state when you refuse to go back to '67 borders?</p><p end="2649" is_meta="false" speaker="Dore Gold" start="2580">Because the borders have nothing to do with the existence of a state.</p><p end="2649" is_meta="false" speaker="Daniel Levy" start="2580">Sorry. No one says that. That was the initiative of the Israeli prime minister.</p><p end="2649" is_meta="false" speaker="Mustafa Barghouthi" start="2580">And he refused to --</p><p end="2649" is_meta="false" speaker="Daniel Levy" start="2580">No one was telling him unilaterally --</p><p end="2649" is_meta="true" speaker="Daniel Levy" start="2580">talking simultaneously</p><p end="2649" is_meta="false" speaker="Dore Gold" start="2580">No one was telling us unilaterally. It does, but everyone said, if you end the occupation,</p><p end="2649" is_meta="false" speaker="Dore Gold" start="2580">the source of violence will end.</p><p end="2649" is_meta="false" speaker="Daniel Levy" start="2580">Gaza is 6 percent of the land mass of the remaining 22 percent of mandatory Palestine that we're talking about in a two-state solution. No one was saying, any occupation in six percent, maintain and entrench the occupation in 94 percent and see how that goes.</p><p end="2649" is_meta="false" speaker="Dore Gold" start="2580">Wouldn't you expect --</p><p end="2649" is_meta="true" speaker="Dore Gold" start="2580">applause</p><p end="2649" is_meta="false" speaker="Dore Gold" start="2580">Wouldn't you expect that if you get out of the given territory, that the level of violence from that territory would decline? Maybe it would go up elsewhere.</p><p end="2703" is_meta="false" speaker="Dore Gold" start="2649">Okay.</p><p end="2703" is_meta="false" speaker="Dore Gold" start="2649">Well, what if the very resolution itself states that the borders will be the June 4 lines? Is the Palestinian side willing to relinquish that phraseology from a Security Council resolution?</p><p end="2703" is_meta="false" speaker="Mustafa Barghouthi" start="2649">Well, let me reiterate one thing. Let's remember that in 1947 the --</p><p end="2703" is_meta="false" speaker="Dore Gold" start="2649">Simple question.</p><p end="2703" is_meta="false" speaker="Mustafa Barghouthi" start="2649">Yeah, I'm answering this question. In 19 -- he has -- he has been talking a lot, so let me [unintelligible].</p><p end="2703" is_meta="true" speaker="Mustafa Barghouthi" start="2649">laughter</p><p end="2760" is_meta="false" speaker="Mustafa Barghouthi" start="2703">In 1947, it was decided there would be two states. Israel would be on 54 percent of the land, Palestine on 44 percent of the land. Now we are accepting 22 percent. That's less than half of what we should have had according to the UN in '47. And Mr. Gold wants to take away parts of that land because for the settlements that keep growing, Israel is the only country in the world that has not told anybody what are its borders. Why?</p><p end="2760" is_meta="false" speaker="Mustafa Barghouthi" start="2703">Because --</p><p end="2760" is_meta="false" speaker="Dore Gold" start="2703">What about India or Pakistan?</p><p end="2760" is_meta="false" speaker="Dore Gold" start="2703">Why do you --</p><p end="2760" is_meta="false" speaker="Dore Gold" start="2703">And why do you keep --</p><p end="2760" is_meta="true" speaker="Dore Gold" start="2703">talking simultaneously</p><p end="2826" is_meta="false" speaker="Mustafa Barghouthi" start="2760">I think there are four issues for negotiation. There is settlements, there is the borders,</p><p end="2826" is_meta="false" speaker="Mustafa Barghouthi" start="2760">there is the issue of refugees, there is the issue of Jerusalem. Nobody said that admitting us to the UN will mean that we will not negotiate about all these issues.</p><p end="2826" is_meta="false" speaker="Mustafa Barghouthi" start="2760">As one final point, please, it's very dangerous to say we admit, we accept Palestinian,</p><p end="2826" is_meta="false" speaker="Mustafa Barghouthi" start="2760">that they should have a state, but we don't agree with '67 borders because what that means is that you want us to have a Bantustan like there was in South Africa. There were also Bantustans in South Africa with kings, not only presidents. But that did not mean that people were free. They were subjected to discrimination and apartheid system.</p><p end="2826" is_meta="false" speaker="Aaron David Miller" start="2760">Look, we're getting away from some very basic issues here. Admission to the UN recognition would conflate with acknowledgment of sovereignty. Legally, that may not be the case, but that is the way it would be read. That is the way the Palestinian Authority would interpret it. And presumably, that is the way the international community might interpret it as well.</p><p end="2886" is_meta="false" speaker="Aaron David Miller" start="2826">It's critically important --</p><p end="2945" is_meta="false" speaker="Aaron David Miller" start="2886">It's not -- it's not -- one more point, John. John, John, another -- one last point. It's not -</p><p end="2945" is_meta="false" speaker="Aaron David Miller" start="2886">- this notion of a division between what is morally acceptable, what is symbolic and what is pragmatic is a -- is a division without distinction. No one is doubting the fact that if the Palestinians were admitted into the UN, they would be more hopeful. No one is doubting that it would impress on the international community the notion of Palestine as a sovereign state. What I am doubting, and what you have yet to demonstrate, is that such an act would bring us any closer to --</p><p end="2945" is_meta="false" speaker="Aaron David Miller" start="2886">-- meaningful sovereignty --</p><p end="3003" is_meta="false" speaker="Aaron David Miller" start="2945">I'm not going to say a word. I'm not going to say a word.</p><p end="3003" is_meta="false" speaker="Daniel Levy" start="2945">Yeah, exactly. As for the expectation that, if it's admitted to the UN, well, that means it's got full sovereignty. Listen, for 40 plus years, the Soviet Socialist Republic of Belarus,</p><p end="3003" is_meta="false" speaker="Daniel Levy" start="2945">and of Ukraine, were members of the U.N.</p><p end="3061" is_meta="false" speaker="Daniel Levy" start="3003">Did that mean that they were independent states in the USSR? Come on, this is a political act. What we're talking about here is sending a political signal from the U.N.</p><p end="3061" is_meta="false" speaker="Daniel Levy" start="3003">Your second point, the divided Palestinian authority. First of all, Aaron, you didn't get it exactly right in your description of who takes -- who assumes that Palestinian seat at the U.N. It's not the Palestinian authority, it's the PLO, and that has been clarified and made clear. The PLO is still headed by Abbas. The PLO has certain commitments that it has made in signed treaties. And I would look at this as I try and look at most things, to be honest, as how do we use this opportunity? How does this become an entry point to problem solving rather than rejecting it as another nonstop --</p><p end="3061" is_meta="false" speaker="Daniel Levy" start="3003">I want to finish the point.[applause]</p><p end="3061" is_meta="false" speaker="Daniel Levy" start="3003">My entry point for this is a problem solver is I would turn around and say, "Palestine,</p><p end="3061" is_meta="false" speaker="Daniel Levy" start="3003">you're in the U.N., you sign the U.N. charter, read the words of the U.N. Charter.</p><p end="3119" is_meta="false" speaker="Daniel Levy" start="3061">Hamas, you want reconciliation, you have to be signing up to the U.N. Charter as well." I would make this part of the encouragement of internal Palestinian unity, to see the opportunity, not a way to threat.</p><p end="3119" is_meta="true" speaker="Daniel Levy" start="3061">applause</p><p end="3119" is_meta="false" speaker="Dore Gold" start="3061">Daniel Levy mentions the U.N. Charter. And, you know, one of the most important points in this discussion to keep in mind is -- sorry to be legal -- but Article 4 of the Charter, which says, "Membership in the United Nations is open to all other peace loving states which accept the obligation to continue the present charter," peace loving states. Why is that important? Mustafa Barghouthi has invoked the names of Martin Luther King -- I don't know if he said "Gandhi," but --</p><p end="3119" is_meta="false" speaker="Mustafa Barghouthi" start="3061">I said "Gandhi" and "Mandela."</p><p end="3119" is_meta="false" speaker="Dore Gold" start="3061">-- and Mandela --</p><p end="3119" is_meta="true" speaker="Dore Gold" start="3061">laughter</p><p end="3119" is_meta="false" speaker="Dore Gold" start="3061">-- men who were against violence.</p><p end="3119" is_meta="false" speaker="Aaron David Miller" start="3061">If only we had them.</p><p end="3189" is_meta="false" speaker="Dore Gold" start="3119">Exactly, if only -- I mean, Palestinian political culture had adopted those positions, but --</p><p end="3189" is_meta="true" speaker="Dore Gold" start="3119">applause</p><p end="3189" is_meta="false" speaker="Dore Gold" start="3119">-- frankly, frankly, just now, on December 22, in a meeting in Cairo, and I'm not sure whether you were there or not --</p><p end="3189" is_meta="false" speaker="Mustafa Barghouthi" start="3119">I was.</p><p end="3189" is_meta="false" speaker="Dore Gold" start="3119">Yes, okay. I don't want to get it personal, but there was a meeting of the Palestinian leadership and it included Khaled Meshal, the head of Hamas, it included the heads of Islamic jihad, and these are organizations that call for the obliteration of the State of Israel, the destruction of the State of Israel. So how do you square the circle of invoking to an American audience names like Martin Luther King and then going to an event in Cairo with the leaders of the Islamic jihad which is a wing of the Pasdaran of Iran, of sitting with the Hamas leadership while they -- after your meeting with them are quoted in Al-Hayat, in the Arabic press, still calling for armed struggle against the State of Israel?</p><p end="3239" is_meta="false" speaker="Dore Gold" start="3189">I can't square the circle and you cannot have U.N. membership, you cannot have U.N.</p><p end="3239" is_meta="false" speaker="Dore Gold" start="3189">membership when you're coming to the U.N., when you're going to the secretary general --</p><p end="3239" is_meta="false" speaker="Mustafa Barghouthi" start="3189">You know, Dore, I want to ask you about the policy of Israel.</p><p end="3239" is_meta="false" speaker="Dore Gold" start="3189">I asked you about the policy of the Palestinians.</p><p end="3239" is_meta="false" speaker="Mustafa Barghouthi" start="3189">I think --</p><p end="3239" is_meta="false" speaker="Dore Gold" start="3189">And tell me about Cairo. You were there --</p><p end="3239" is_meta="false" speaker="Mustafa Barghouthi" start="3189">I want to ask you about the fact that Israel is the third largest --</p><p end="3239" is_meta="false" speaker="Mustafa Barghouthi" start="3189">No, no, give me the chance to speak here. Israel is the third largest military exporter in the world.</p><p end="3239" is_meta="false" speaker="Dore Gold" start="3189">Exporter?</p><p end="3239" is_meta="false" speaker="Mustafa Barghouthi" start="3189">Yes, Israel is now -- has you know hundreds of nuclear heads.</p><p end="3299" is_meta="false" speaker="Mustafa Barghouthi" start="3239">We all know that, so when you speak about peace and you speak about nonviolence,</p><p end="3299" is_meta="false" speaker="Mustafa Barghouthi" start="3239">you might as well think of how Israel itself should stop using violence.</p><p end="3299" is_meta="true" speaker="Mustafa Barghouthi" start="3239">applause</p><p end="3299" is_meta="false" speaker="Mustafa Barghouthi" start="3239">Now, you said one of the arguments that were told here by Mr. Miller is that --</p><p end="3299" is_meta="false" speaker="Mustafa Barghouthi" start="3239">No, no, no, no.</p><p end="3366" is_meta="false" speaker="Mustafa Barghouthi" start="3299">There are two major important developments that have happened thanks to our work,</p><p end="3366" is_meta="false" speaker="Mustafa Barghouthi" start="3299">thanks to our advocacy of non-violence, which is that I know there are several statements and you could pick up the bad ones, but the official position now of Hamas is to accept non-violence. This is a big achievement, and you should be happy about it. If people change positively, you should not get angry, as Mr. Gold does. Also, they are accepting &#8217;67 borders. That&#8217;s an important change.</p><p end="3366" is_meta="false" speaker="Dore Gold" start="3299">Excuse me, can I make a point?</p><p end="3366" is_meta="true" speaker="Dore Gold" start="3299">talking simultaneously</p><p end="3366" is_meta="false" speaker="Mustafa Barghouthi" start="3299">And when we --</p><p end="3428" is_meta="false" speaker="Mustafa Barghouthi" start="3366">Why going to the U.N., why admission of the U.N will change the parameters for once [unintelligible]? The balance of power today is so much skewed in the interest of Israel,</p><p end="3428" is_meta="false" speaker="Mustafa Barghouthi" start="3366">and Israel does what it wants. What we need to do is to change the balance of power.</p><p end="3428" is_meta="false" speaker="Aaron David Miller" start="3366">We&#8217;re engaged -- with all due respect, I --</p><p end="3428" is_meta="false" speaker="Aaron David Miller" start="3366">With all due respect to IQ2 U.S. -- I want to be invited back at some point -- we&#8217;re engaged in a kind of a thought experiment here. There&#8217;s a certain reality which we,</p><p end="3428" is_meta="false" speaker="Aaron David Miller" start="3366">once we leave this theater tonight, we&#8217;ll have to take account of there are only three ways that the Palestinian state will be born.</p><p end="3480" is_meta="false" speaker="Aaron David Miller" start="3428">Either the Palestinians will take it from the Israelis by force, which they are unable and I take you at your word, Mustafa, unwilling to do. Second, an international organization or body where the will of the international community will somehow deliver it to them on their behalf, but that is incredibly fanciful. The notion that admission into the U.N.</p><p end="3480" is_meta="false" speaker="Aaron David Miller" start="3428">will give you access to the ICC, the International Criminal Court, the Israelis will have their own case to be made against you. And, by the way --</p><p end="3480" is_meta="false" speaker="Aaron David Miller" start="3428">That in itself is a -- I have a tremendous respect for you, Mustafa, but that is -- that strains the bounds of credulity to the breaking point --</p><p end="3480" is_meta="true" speaker="Aaron David Miller" start="3428">applause</p><p end="3542" is_meta="false" speaker="Aaron David Miller" start="3480">And by the way, and by the way, this is a political organization which may, in fact, be undergoing a transformation. It is going to have to find a new home because the arc on the Assads is running south.</p><p end="3542" is_meta="true" speaker="Aaron David Miller" start="3480">talking simultaneously</p><p end="3542" is_meta="true" speaker="Mustafa Barghouthi" start="3480">unintelligible</p><p end="3542" is_meta="false" speaker="Aaron David Miller" start="3480">No, what I&#8217;m saying to you is that if in fact there is a change, it is a process that will have to be demonstrated not in words and not in quiet conversation and not in Cairo --</p><p end="3542" is_meta="true" speaker="Aaron David Miller" start="3480">talking simultaneously</p><p end="3542" is_meta="false" speaker="Aaron David Miller" start="3480">That is not -- that is not the main issue.</p><p end="3542" is_meta="false" speaker="Daniel Levy" start="3480">I know this is an issue in which people, you know, kind of skate in and out, don&#8217;t have very deeply held feelings.</p><p end="3542" is_meta="true" speaker="Daniel Levy" start="3480">laughter</p><p end="3542" is_meta="false" speaker="Daniel Levy" start="3480">I think it&#8217;s a shame that we&#8217;ve descended into a blame game here, and I want to try and pick up on the thread that I think Aaron was trying to reintroduce to the conversation.</p><p end="3542" is_meta="false" speaker="Daniel Levy" start="3480">The Palestinians can take this by force.</p><p end="3604" is_meta="false" speaker="Daniel Levy" start="3542">They can have it delivered to them by the international community. And I&#8217;m guessing where you&#8217;re going with the third one is they can convince the Israelis to actually withdraw. Or at least that&#8217;s where I would go with it. And if you&#8217;re about to tell me that they can wait for America to deliver it for them, then I suggest you see a production of &#8220;Waiting for Godot.&#8221;</p><p end="3604" is_meta="true" speaker="Daniel Levy" start="3542">laughter</p><p end="3604" is_meta="false" speaker="Daniel Levy" start="3542">No, the point I want to make is that I think what the Israeli public needs to see right now, yes, there&#8217;s a continued -- there&#8217;s more of a Palestinian commitment and are continued by those who are already there, commitment to living alongside Israel, but I don&#8217;t think a charm offensive is the entirety of the ingredients that we have to bring into the mix. We have to bring in the ingredients which say to the Israelis, &#8220;Hey, I hope we&#8217;re moving away from violence, but we can&#8217;t sit on the sidelines while you swallow up all of Palestine. So we're going to make declarative attempts.</p><p end="3667" is_meta="false" speaker="Daniel Levy" start="3604">This does not mitigate against the fact that we want to live alongside you. We're not trying to replace you at the UN. But we do have to begin to accumulate some beginnings of a balance of leverage, some addressing of this asymmetry. I think that's productive for any future Israeli-Palestinian process.</p><p end="3667" is_meta="false" speaker="Daniel Levy" start="3604">John Donvan:All right. I'm going to -- I'm going to come to the audience for questions in a moment.</p><p end="3667" is_meta="false" speaker="Daniel Levy" start="3604">Dore Gold has been very patient waiting through two rounds for a chance to respond.</p><p end="3667" is_meta="false" speaker="Dore Gold" start="3604">Well, one of the purposes --</p><p end="3667" is_meta="false" speaker="Dore Gold" start="3604">One of the purposes of this discussion -- we're in an academic setting. Academic setting means we have to distill what the truth is about certain situations. And we have to report the facts. And it is interesting to share those facts when you come from Cairo, or I come from Jerusalem. And unfortunately, there is the fact that five days after your meeting in Cairo, Hamas, on its official website, Palestine-info.info, Hamas made the following statement.</p><p end="3728" is_meta="false" speaker="Dore Gold" start="3667">"We underline our adherence to our right to the struggle in all its forms, particularly the armed struggle." That's not Martin Luther King. Sorry.</p><p end="3728" is_meta="true" speaker="Dore Gold" start="3667">applause</p><p end="3728" is_meta="false" speaker="Dore Gold" start="3667">And if I can just finish the sentence, it's not the UN charter which is our subject for tonight. And you can't embellish this. You can't somehow treat it as though it's not there, because you're asking these people to vote for admission of Palestine to the UN.</p><p end="3728" is_meta="false" speaker="Dore Gold" start="3667">If Palestine involves arms struggle, are you prepared to vote for arms struggle against my people, the people of Israel?</p><p end="3728" is_meta="false" speaker="Mustafa Barghouthi" start="3667">I can quote here --</p><p end="3728" is_meta="false" speaker="Mustafa Barghouthi" start="3667">-- many Israelis, including rabbis and Mr. Lieberman, your foreign minister, who described Palestinians as [unintelligible] crushers [phonetic].

The first is about the 10-month settlements. The 10-month settlement to me, it's -- actually, there was no freeze, because it did not include Jerusalem. It did not include what they call &#8220;natural growth.&#8221; So there wasn't freeze.</p><p end="4024" is_meta="false" speaker="Mustafa Barghouthi" start="3966">And Palestinians are trying their best, although I would agree with the tactics. But yesterday --</p><p end="4085" is_meta="false" speaker="Mustafa Barghouthi" start="4024">About the motion, yes. The second question is about the motion. And I want to say here that if we are admitted to the UN, the most important thing that will come out is that the illegal actions of settlements which are destroying the possibility of a two-state solution would be invalid. That means de facto creation of settlements on the ground does not undermine the right of the Palestinians to have a state. That will be good for peace and for two-state solution.</p><p end="4085" is_meta="false" speaker="Aaron David Miller" start="4024">Well, I think it --</p><p end="4085" is_meta="false" speaker="Mustafa Barghouthi" start="4024">It doesn't.</p><p end="4085" is_meta="false" speaker="Aaron David Miller" start="4024">It is -- admission to the UN will not stop Israeli settlement activity. I would argue actually it's going to accelerate it. And it will allow the Israelis to make it unmistakably clear to the Americans, who will, in fact, take their part in this, in large part because we -</p><p end="4085" is_meta="false" speaker="Aaron David Miller" start="4024">-</p><p end="4145" is_meta="false" speaker="Aaron David Miller" start="4085">The legal standing to do what? The day after you are admitted --</p><p end="4145" is_meta="false" speaker="Mustafa Barghouthi" start="4085">The fact --</p><p end="4145" is_meta="false" speaker="Aaron David Miller" start="4085">Mustafa, let me finish.</p><p end="4145" is_meta="false" speaker="Mustafa Barghouthi" start="4085">-- on the ground will not become fact --</p><p end="4145" is_meta="false" speaker="Aaron David Miller" start="4085">Mustafa, let me finish. The day after you are admitted into the UN, nothing will change.</p><p end="4145" is_meta="false" speaker="Aaron David Miller" start="4085">And arguably -- and we've been arguing about it. Nothing is going to change because neither -- you need two powers to support and make sovereignty meaningful to you.</p><p end="4145" is_meta="false" speaker="Aaron David Miller" start="4085">You may have given up on them. You may have convinced yourselves that their administrations are bankrupt, and they may offer you no hope. But it is a reality that unless you can take what you want by force, unless the international community is going to give it to you, which they will not. They will not. They have the Iranians, they have the Syrians. People are standing in line to sanction well ahead of what the international community would do with respect to the Israelis.</p><p end="4201" is_meta="false" speaker="Aaron David Miller" start="4145">Your ultimate objective is to create -- and I would agree with Daniel -- a different constellation of forces to support a negotiation, to end the conflict. But you cannotcreate that improved balance by seeking admission into the UN. It will not improve your standing. And I have heard nothing in the last hour --</p><p end="4201" is_meta="false" speaker="Aaron David Miller" start="4145">-- to suggest that it will.</p><p end="4201" is_meta="false" speaker="Mustafa Barghouthi" start="4145">But before that, one second, please. I didn't say that admission to the UN is the only factor that will change the balance. I said this is part of a bigger thing which is popular,</p><p end="4201" is_meta="false" speaker="Mustafa Barghouthi" start="4145">nonviolent resistance. It's diplomatic resistance within the context of something bigger.</p><p end="4201" is_meta="false" speaker="Mustafa Barghouthi" start="4145">This will change parameters.</p><p end="4201" is_meta="false" speaker="Aaron David Miller" start="4145">But you'll get the --</p><p end="4201" is_meta="false" speaker="Aaron David Miller" start="4145">You'll get the opposite reaction.</p><p end="4201" is_meta="false" speaker="Daniel Levy" start="4145">Two responses, Aaron. First, I really beg to differ with you on what looks different the morning after Palestine's admitted to the UN.</p><p end="4264" is_meta="false" speaker="Daniel Levy" start="4201">In the following way, and this isn't just about Prime Minister Netanyahu and his coalition, but I do think that when Prime Minister Netanyahu can strut his stuff and say,</p><p end="4264" is_meta="false" speaker="Daniel Levy" start="4201">"You see, the international community doesn't admit Palestine to the U.N.," I think that sends precisely the wrong signal to the Israeli public. I give credit to the Israeli public intelligence in knowing the cost benefit calculation of the signals they're receiving are not affirmative enough yet regarding two states, and I think it's that signal that matters,</p><p end="4264" is_meta="false" speaker="Daniel Levy" start="4201">and I do think it's not going to change everything but it would change something in thediscourse if Palestine is admitted to the U.N. And that's the kind of change that we need to begin to see happening.</p><p end="4322" is_meta="false" speaker="Mustafa Barghouthi" start="4264">There was once an Israeli prime minister by the name of Golda Meir.</p><p end="4382" is_meta="false" speaker="Mustafa Barghouthi" start="4322">She said, "Who are the Palestinians? They don't exist." Well, since then, Israel has been fighting with a non-existing people. And I feel -- I'm so sorry that you think --</p><p end="4382" is_meta="false" speaker="Mustafa Barghouthi" start="4322">I'm so sorry that you think this way, ma'am, because denying the presence of people is nothing but a reflection of racism.</p><p end="4382" is_meta="true" speaker="Mustafa Barghouthi" start="4322">applause</p><p end="4382" is_meta="false" speaker="Mustafa Barghouthi" start="4322">We are there. We are there. We have our history. We're 11 million people. Six million of us are in the Diaspora. You know what would surprise you most is how much Palestinians are similar to the Jewish people. The suffering you had, we have and we will get there one day. And you and us would be happy --</p><p end="4442" is_meta="false" speaker="Daniel Levy" start="4382">Well, Israel signs agreements with the PLO or the agreements that Prime Minister Netanyahu signed that were referred to earlier, those are signed with the PLO, the Palestinian Liberation Organization. There's negotiation right now as to whether on the conditions under which Hamas and other bodies will join the PLO. They're not in the PLO at the moment. The PNC is in the PLO. Every member of the Palestinianparliament, which means the gentleman sitting next to me is included in the PLO, that's who Israel --</p><p end="4573" is_meta="false" speaker="Daniel Levy" start="4501">I think you --</p><p end="4573" is_meta="false" speaker="Daniel Levy" start="4501">-- General Council with other U.N. bodies.</p><p end="4573" is_meta="false" speaker="Daniel Levy" start="4501">There are 41 U.N. vetoes against resolutions in the Security Council.</p><p end="4634" is_meta="false" speaker="Daniel Levy" start="4573">Yeah. I mean, as I&#8217;ve said, I think there are two ways of coming at this. First of all, call me curmudgeonly pessimist, but I don&#8217;t think the morning after Palestine&#8217;s admitted to the U.N., Israel is going to say, &#8220;Ah, game&#8217;s up. We&#8217;re withdrawing to the &#8217;67 lines now.&#8221;</p><p end="4686" is_meta="false" speaker="Daniel Levy" start="4634">So, in practical terms, you know, I believe that this is about what signals do we send,</p><p end="4686" is_meta="false" speaker="Daniel Levy" start="4634">even as an academic exercise. So in practical terms, I think it&#8217;s a crucial question, but it&#8217;s not the morning after we all vote tonight or you all vote tonight or Palestine is admitted to the U.N. What I do think is -- and you know, let&#8217;s be creative diplomatically here -- what I do think is you should be encouraging realistic terms for Palestinian reconciliation, for one authority with one gun. And I think part of the blend of how you do that could be using the very admission of Palestine to the U.N., the very signing of that U.N. charter to hold Hamas to a certain standard on violence. Personally, I think,</p><p end="4686" is_meta="false" speaker="Daniel Levy" start="4634">the --</p><p end="4745" is_meta="false" speaker="Daniel Levy" start="4686">-- condition were not a good idea. The violence one was.</p><p end="4801" is_meta="false" speaker="Aaron David Miller" start="4745">Daniel&#8217;s response to this --</p><p end="4801" is_meta="false" speaker="Aaron David Miller" start="4745">-- question, to me, is an indication of the fundamental problem. It isn&#8217;t thought through, Daniel. Your response to this young woman is simply not rigorously thought through. You're assuming that we can create --</p><p end="4801" is_meta="false" speaker="Daniel Levy" start="4745">Go on. Help me with my lack of rigorous thinking Aaron--</p><p end="4801" is_meta="false" speaker="Aaron David Miller" start="4745">No, no, that is not my -- I&#8217;m out of that business. I&#8217;m not here to help you think it through cleanly, but you are dispending a proposition that will in effect set into amotion a set of consequences over which you will have absolutely no control. This is the fundamental problem.</p><p end="4866" is_meta="false" speaker="Aaron David Miller" start="4801">Just because negotiations are stuck, and I am the first person to acknowledge just how stuck they really are -- doesn't mean that in an effort to maintain hope, to diffuse desperation and to accommodate some measure of urgency, we need to pursue an idea that I would argue to you -- and you've, in my judgment, failed to demonstrate where the real upsides are. The downsides of this are very, very real. In July 2000, we decided to recommend to Bill Clinton to go to Camp David to try to create a conflict-ending solution between Israelis and Palestinians. Do you realize that a dozen years after that summit, we are still paying for the lack of wisdom and the recklessness of that decision?</p><p end="4866" is_meta="false" speaker="Aaron David Miller" start="4801">Israelis and Palestinians have not yet recovered from the trauma of those ten years,</p><p end="4866" is_meta="false" speaker="Aaron David Miller" start="4801">because we believed in an effort to do something in the face of a desperate situation,</p><p end="4866" is_meta="false" speaker="Aaron David Miller" start="4801">that we could make it better. This notion --</p><p end="4925" is_meta="false" speaker="Aaron David Miller" start="4866">-- is reckless, and it's not well thought through.</p><p end="4925" is_meta="false" speaker="Daniel Levy" start="4866">With all due respect -- with all due respect, Aaron, to American omnipotence, I think we can allow Israelis and Palestinians just a little bit of agency for what happened --</p><p end="4925" is_meta="false" speaker="Aaron David Miller" start="4866">They can have all the agency they want.</p><p end="4925" is_meta="false" speaker="Daniel Levy" start="4866">-- in the last dozen years. And I'm sorry, Aaron. What you have failed to demonstrate is what is the negative impacts of having two states at the UN. What you've failed to --</p><p end="4925" is_meta="false" speaker="Daniel Levy" start="4866">what have you said?</p><p end="4925" is_meta="false" speaker="Aaron David Miller" start="4866">Because you --</p><p end="4925" is_meta="false" speaker="Aaron David Miller" start="4866">Daniel Levy:No, sorry. You've said this may harm Obama's re-election. Well, I don't think it's realistic --</p><p end="4925" is_meta="false" speaker="Aaron David Miller" start="4866">No, that's not the major point.</p><p end="4925" is_meta="false" speaker="Daniel Levy" start="4866">Okay. Let's go on then. You have said -- you have said that it might lead to more settlements. You know what? If the Israeli goal is to make this territory indivisible --</p><p end="4925" is_meta="false" speaker="Daniel Levy" start="4866">and I hope it's not, but if that's the goal, let's start dealing with that reality. I don't want to go there. You've said it would undermine negotiations. Negotiations have gone nowhere. You're the one who wrote that it was America acting as Israel's lawyer that undermined that very Camp David effort that you just reminded us about. So come on.</p><p end="4983" is_meta="false" speaker="Daniel Levy" start="4925">Give us a constructive proposal to move forward because we've explained why this helps, and you haven't explained why it doesn't.</p><p end="4983" is_meta="true" speaker="Daniel Levy" start="4925">applause</p><p end="4983" is_meta="false" speaker="Daniel Levy" start="4925">I do not think that the Palestinian right to self-determination, and therefore, by extension, Palestinian membership at the UN should be contingent on that. What I do think -- and I made clear here tonight -- I do not think that.</p><p end="5045" is_meta="false" speaker="Daniel Levy" start="4983">What I do think -- what I do think is we should use this, vis-a-vis Hamas. And I want to make another point here, because we've spoken an awful lot about Hamas. And anyway, as people have noticed, there's something going on in the Middle East. The Muslim Brotherhood, political Islam, of which Hamas is a part, is kind of popular when people get the chance to vote democratically. This is a reality we have to deal with.</p><p end="5045" is_meta="false" speaker="Daniel Levy" start="4983">Now, we can bury our heads in the sand and say, there's a charter, and you have to stand up and publicly disavow X, Y or zed, or we can work, work day in, day out, to try and create a new reality that Hamas relates to, to try and create a new reality that the Muslim Brotherhood relates to, to work with this new reality in the Middle East. And the more Israel buries its head in the sand and says, you have to tick boxes X, Y and zed before we do anything, the worst we are going to make are predicament.</p><p end="5105" is_meta="false" speaker="Mustafa Barghouthi" start="5045">But on one side, we are told we would not be able to progress because Palestinians are divided. But then the same people, Israel and Mr. Gold, are against Palestinian unity.</p><p end="5105" is_meta="false" speaker="Mustafa Barghouthi" start="5045">What we are working on, what we have achieved, actually, through the most recent negotiations is that Hamas officially declared, on the words of Khaled Meshal, that they are committing to nonviolence. I am trying to explain that to you, and you -- you don't want even to hear it, because if change is happening in the positive direction, what you see today is -- there is no violence in --</p><p end="5105" is_meta="false" speaker="Mustafa Barghouthi" start="5045">And -- no, no, but just one last point. If you -- what Mr. Miller is reporting is just specifically a continuation of the status quo. And we are saying this is dangerous,</p><p end="5105" is_meta="false" speaker="Mustafa Barghouthi" start="5045">because today you have the whole Palestinian camp ready to accept nonviolence.</p><p end="5161" is_meta="false" speaker="Mustafa Barghouthi" start="5105">If nothing changes, if a solution is not found, if we don't move forward, then things will get worse. Is that what we want? We want to find a solution. And when we say we are admitting -- we are committing to nonviolence, we are doing diplomatic resistance,</p><p end="5161" is_meta="false" speaker="Mustafa Barghouthi" start="5105">Israel should be happy about that, because that opens the road for a solution.</p><p end="5161" is_meta="false" speaker="Mustafa Barghouthi" start="5105">-- just staying on the same course means--</p><p end="5161" is_meta="false" speaker="Daniel Levy" start="5105">What did you do in Iraq? What did you do in Iraq? What was the Sunni awakening that you worked with? Were these people who were shooting Americans, did you ask them to make all kinds of pretty statements? You faced a tough situation.</p><p end="5228" is_meta="false" speaker="Daniel Levy" start="5161">What are you doing now with the Taliban? Sometimes you have to mix it with unpleasant, unsavory elements. This isn't a lesson in how to primly have nice tea parties. This is a hard reality --</p><p end="5228" is_meta="false" speaker="Aaron David Miller" start="5161">Daniel, if you -- if you --</p><p end="5228" is_meta="false" speaker="Mustafa Barghouthi" start="5161">The fact that Mr. Zahar and others came out against Meshal is proving my point,</p><p end="5228" is_meta="false" speaker="Mustafa Barghouthi" start="5161">because that means that a division is happening there. But the official spokesperson,</p><p end="5228" is_meta="false" speaker="Mustafa Barghouthi" start="5161">the leaders of this movement are admitting this. If this positive change is creating opposition within that organization, that is another proof that this is serious.</p><p end="5228" is_meta="false" speaker="Mustafa Barghouthi" start="5161">And at the end of the day, the Palestinians are coming to the United Nations and saying,</p><p end="5228" is_meta="false" speaker="Mustafa Barghouthi" start="5161">we are committed to nonviolence as the PLO and as Palestinians.</p><p end="5228" is_meta="false" speaker="Aaron David Miller" start="5161">Look, in a negotiation, at least this negotiation, even if you were admitted as a member state, the logic of your analysis just isn't good enough.</p><p end="5287" is_meta="false" speaker="Aaron David Miller" start="5228">You are going to need a monopoly over the organized forces of violence in your society,</p><p end="5287" is_meta="false" speaker="Aaron David Miller" start="5228">even to induce the Israelis or even by extension the Americans.</p><p end="5287" is_meta="false" speaker="Mustafa Barghouthi" start="5228">But isn't that what you praised in the West Bank today?</p><p end="5287" is_meta="false" speaker="Aaron David Miller" start="5228">To help broker a solution on --</p><p end="5287" is_meta="false" speaker="Mustafa Barghouthi" start="5228">Aren&#8217;t you praising the government in the West Bank for having done that.</p><p end="5287" is_meta="false" speaker="Aaron David Miller" start="5228">Can I finish? On the four core issues that drive the conflict, you will need one gun, one authority and one negotiating [unintelligible].</p><p end="5287" is_meta="false" speaker="Mustafa Barghouthi" start="5228">In the West Bank, and he is praising it. He is praising Mr. Fayyad on --</p><p end="5287" is_meta="true" speaker="Mustafa Barghouthi" start="5228">talking simultaneously</p><p end="5287" is_meta="false" speaker="Mustafa Barghouthi" start="5228">Isn't that the case today in the West Bank?</p><p end="5287" is_meta="false" speaker="Aaron David Miller" start="5228">Sadly, as a consequence of the Oslo process, the area that you do control, you've actually done it as a consequence of intimate security cooperation with the Israelis and assisted by the United States and the Jordanians quite a lot, yes.</p><p end="5345" is_meta="false" speaker="Mustafa Barghouthi" start="5287">So why are you unhappy?</p><p end="5345" is_meta="false" speaker="Aaron David Miller" start="5287">And you're building the institutions of statehood. But it's a far cry to assume that your national movement right now is unified and cohesive enough to warrant what it is you seek. Right now -- and I don't mean to trivialize this. The Palestinian national movement is literally like Noah's ark. There are two of everything. There are two Constitutions.</p><p end="5345" is_meta="false" speaker="Aaron David Miller" start="5287">There are two sets of security services. There are two polities. There are two independent entities --</p><p end="5345" is_meta="false" speaker="Mustafa Barghouthi" start="5287">At least we have a Constitution. Israel does not have a constitution.</p><p end="5345" is_meta="false" speaker="Dore Gold" start="5287">Neither does Great Britain.</p><p end="5345" is_meta="false" speaker="Dore Gold" start="5287">Aaron David Miller:On this narrow point -- on this narrow point --</p><p end="5345" is_meta="true" speaker="Dore Gold" start="5287">talking simultaneously</p><p end="5345" is_meta="false" speaker="Daniel Levy" start="5287">What I'm hearing is that a case has been made. What I'm hearing is a lot of obfuscation from the other side. What I'm not hearing is, how do we advance this in a different way? What I've not heard --</p><p end="5403" is_meta="false" speaker="Daniel Levy" start="5345">I know. I know. I know. But we're making a case. We're making a case for how you can begin to lay down a marker on a rapidly evaporating two-state prospect. And all we've heard -- and I thought we'd hear it. And even -- I do think there's some onus on the other side to do a little more than give us an hour and a half of nay saying. I'm sorry,</p><p end="5403" is_meta="false" speaker="Daniel Levy" start="5345">but I really --</p><p end="5403" is_meta="false" speaker="Aaron David Miller" start="5345">If the proposition -- John, can I -- can I respond?</p><p end="5403" is_meta="false" speaker="Aaron David Miller" start="5345">If the proposition that IQ2 US wanted to sponsor was, is Israeli-Palestinian peace possible, then we could have had a discussion. But the assertion that is made here --</p><p end="5403" is_meta="false" speaker="Aaron David Miller" start="5345">the motion is -- you are asserting that Palestine should be admitted as a member state.</p><p end="5403" is_meta="false" speaker="Aaron David Miller" start="5345">And it is our -- it was our objective -- we may not have succeeded to your satisfaction --</p><p end="5403" is_meta="false" speaker="Aaron David Miller" start="5345">-- perhaps even to the audience's, demonstrate why in fact that course of action--</p><p end="5403" is_meta="true" speaker="Aaron David Miller" start="5345">talking simultaneously</p><p end="5468" is_meta="false" speaker="Mustafa Barghouthi" start="5403">What you are suggesting, Mr. Miller, is that we give Israel the time to finish the settlement project.</p><p end="5468" is_meta="false" speaker="Aaron David Miller" start="5403">I'm not suggesting that at all.</p><p end="5468" is_meta="true" speaker="Aaron David Miller" start="5403">applause</p><p end="5525" is_meta="false" speaker="Mustafa Barghouthi" start="5468">You are a young man. You are a young man. And I think as a young person -- I'm responding to your question -- no, I'm saying as a young person, and I admire young people, you should look into the reality today, not keep talking about the past. What you are describing -- what you are describing is something that is a long time disappeared. And if we keep going back to the past, we will not find a way to the future.You're asking why Israel exchanged one prisoner for 1,000 Palestinian prisoners,</p><p end="5525" is_meta="false" speaker="Mustafa Barghouthi" start="5468">because Palestinians had only one prisoner.</p><p end="5582" is_meta="false" speaker="Mustafa Barghouthi" start="5525">And, by the way, by the way, by the way, there are still 5,000 Palestinian prisoners in Israeli jails. Do you know how it feels -- do you know how it feels -- what is strange to me is why when the Oslo agreement was signed, not all of the Palestinian prisoners were released, why did it take Hamas to capture an Israeli soldier so that [unintelligible]</p><p end="5582" is_meta="false" speaker="Mustafa Barghouthi" start="5525">spent 33 years in jail had to be released? Why couldn't they be released? Because of the peace agreement. This is the mistake.</p><p end="5701" is_meta="false" speaker="Mustafa Barghouthi" start="5642">Let me clarify one point here. When Hamas won election, they got 44 percent of the votes and Fata got 41 percent. It was the stupidity of Fatah, who did not accept full proportional system that led to Hamas getting a majority in the parliament. Today I assure you there is a growing number of Palestinians that want to see a third alternative, which I think we represent. And I do not think that either Hamas or Fatah will get an absolute majority in any future elections. What you should encourage is that Palestine becomes a full state democracy with pluralism. I always believed and I still believe that the only way to have a peaceful -- a lasting peace between both sides is if we have two democracies negotiating an agreement and not to have an agreement enforced from one side to another.</p><p end="5766" is_meta="false" speaker="Aaron David Miller" start="5701">Yeah, thank you very much. I realize that in the last 90 minutes that perhaps one of the most astute things that I&#8217;ve done, one of the best decisions I&#8217;ve made was to leave the Arab-Israeli negotiating process.</p><p end="5766" is_meta="true" speaker="Aaron David Miller" start="5701">laughter</p><p end="5766" is_meta="false" speaker="Aaron David Miller" start="5701">And I say that with tremendous respect and affection for everybody on this panel. If the goal is achieving statehood, if that is really the goal, then it seems to me that U.N.</p><p end="5766" is_meta="false" speaker="Aaron David Miller" start="5701">admission simply doesn&#8217;t make much sense.</p><p end="5832" is_meta="false" speaker="Aaron David Miller" start="5766">You alienate the two countries that Palestinians will need -- Israel and the United States -- to produce meaningful and legitimate Palestinian sovereignty. You will kill Salam Fayyad&#8217;s nation-state building effort. There&#8217;s no question about that. And you&#8217;re putting your hope in an international community that has never ever abandoned you,</p><p end="5832" is_meta="false" speaker="Aaron David Miller" start="5766">actually, but isn&#8217;t capable of delivering your sovereignty. And I would argue that even though, Dan, you persist in saying that we haven&#8217;t demonstrated what the downsides are, I think given, in my judgment, the risks of admission and the uncertainties that will certainly follow, other than hope, which is extremely important, and diffusing a measure of desperation, even more important, you haven&#8217;t demonstrated how in effect U.N.</p><p end="5832" is_meta="false" speaker="Aaron David Miller" start="5766">membership will bring Mustafa Barghouthi and his people any closer, any closer to negotiating Jerusalem borders, security, refugee into meaningful statehood.</p><p end="5883" is_meta="false" speaker="Aaron David Miller" start="5832">Maybe the strategy has more to do with internal Palestinian politics with Mahmoud Abbas&#8217;s exit strategy, with the Arab spring and the Arab winter, with a full reconciliation with Hamas. In effect, if that is your objective, well then maybe you should seek U.N.</p><p end="5883" is_meta="false" speaker="Aaron David Miller" start="5832">admission but not if you want to facilitate the negotiations. My good friend, Daniel Levy, wrote the day before yesterday, the PLO strategy -- the PLO has a bad case of strategic combobulation. And the U.N-Palestinian effort was a weak -- a damp squib, a damp squib -- damp squib --</p><p end="5883" is_meta="false" speaker="Aaron David Miller" start="5832">If Daniel Levy doesn&#8217;t believe it, which I don&#8217;t think he does, then why should --</p><p end="5883" is_meta="false" speaker="Aaron David Miller" start="5832">Then why should we believe it?</p><p end="5944" is_meta="false" speaker="Aaron David Miller" start="5883">John Donvan:Thank you, Aaron David Miller. Our motion is &#8220;The U.N. should admit Palestine as a full member state,&#8221; and here to summarize his position in support of this motion, Daniel Levy, former Israeli peace negotiator and senior fellow at the New America Foundation.</p><p end="5944" is_meta="false" speaker="Daniel Levy" start="5883">What I said was right. I think the Palestinians should pursue this in a different way, and it&#8217;s going to take time, but there&#8217;s a strategy for getting there. We&#8217;ve spoken a lot here about Hamas. But I think the way you further empower Hamas and discourage change in Hamas is to close all nonviolent diplomatic options in the face of the Palestinians. I know people here. And I also don&#8217;t like to hear the word &#8220;apartheid.&#8221; Here&#8217;s what the Israeli minister of defense, Ehud Barak, said in February 2010, &#8220;The simple truth, there is one state including Israel, the West Bank and Gaza. It&#8217;s either bi-national or undemocratic.&#8221; That will be an apartheid state. That&#8217;s the tragedy that we want to prevent.</p><p end="6006" is_meta="false" speaker="Daniel Levy" start="5944">And you know what? Our toolbox is an impoverished one because we have tried so much already. But sticking exclusively with negotiations really must be the dumbest idea. So what do we have left that&#8217;s nonviolent. Let&#8217;s use the international tools of diplomacy that are at our disposal to make a statement. We haven&#8217;t heard negative consequences that can come from this. And mostly we haven&#8217;t heard what else to do except to blindly continue to place our faith in negotiations or that the Palestinians somehow should only be ingratiating themselves without creating any leverage with Israel and America. It&#8217;s been tried. It hasn&#8217;t worked. The risk is the status quo. The risk is the continued dissent of Israeli democracy to a place where it will be unrecognizable and an inability to reach a two-state solution. We need to send a signal here from this room that Palestine should be admitted to the UN.</p><p end="6063" is_meta="false" speaker="Daniel Levy" start="6006">And the UN needs to send a signal to Israelis and Palestinians that there's going to be a two-state solution, otherwise the next debate will be about equal rights in one indivisible territorial unit. I'm not against equal rights in democracy, but I want an Israel,</p><p end="6063" is_meta="false" speaker="Daniel Levy" start="6006">an Israel that's different, that changes. But I want an Israel. And I'm sure Mustafa wants a Palestine. And we should have both of those as member states of the UN.</p><p end="6063" is_meta="false" speaker="Dore Gold" start="6006">These are -- this is a very important issue. And I am sorry that at certain points in this discussion we got heated. But the stakes are not just winning a debate in this very nice auditorium in NYU. This is about issues that relate to our very existence.</p><p end="6119" is_meta="false" speaker="Dore Gold" start="6063">I started, before I was cut off earlier on, telling you that when we withdrew from the Gaza strip in 2005, we had great hopes that we were removing a cause, an irritant, and therefore, Prime Minister Sharon, whom I knew very well, decided to take that risk and pulled out unilaterally. And instead of rocket fire dropping as a result, it increased between 2005 and 2006 by 500 percent. The state of Israel is obligated to make sure that whatever arrangement we make on the West Bank doesn't replicate the conditions in the Gaza Strip. Unfortunately, unfortunately, Mahmoud Abbas has decided on a course of action that he actually began at the end of the Olmert government. It's a course of unilateralism.</p><p end="6188" is_meta="false" speaker="Dore Gold" start="6119">And with this unilateralism is an effort to get recognized as a Palestinian state with UN membership, without having to address our concerns, without having to address the security of Israel, without having to recognize my people's right to a nation state, even though I'm being asked to recognize his people's right to a nation state. And finally, to predetermine the outcome of negotiations by going to the UN and saying, the borders will be June 4, even though the UN back in '67 said we weren't going back to the exact '67 lines. And therefore, I suggest to you, particularly in light of the fact that we're seeing an effort to sell you an unreformed Hamas, and unreformed Islamic Jihadist part of the Palestinian political community, to reject the notion that the Palestinians should be accepted as a member state until they change.</p><p end="6244" is_meta="false" speaker="Mustafa Barghouthi" start="6188">Thank you. Mr. Gold has repeated practically what Weisglass, who was an advisor to Mr. Sharon when he said that we withdraw from Gaza so that we can put peace in formaldehyde. We can put peace to sleep. Unfortunately, creating fear is not a solution. And everything that Mr. Miller and Gold have suggested today is nothing but wasting time and using time. And I am telling them, you can maybe afford to lose time because you haven't lived for 44 years under occupation. You haven't lived in this position for a long time. And you haven't been humiliated every day by occupying forces. You can maybe even afford to be sarcastic, gloomy, and even depressed.</p><p end="6304" is_meta="false" speaker="Mustafa Barghouthi" start="6244">But that will not bring change. Yes, the peace process has become a substitute to peace, and that's why we need to change the situation. I cannot afford to lose time because this is about my life, about my daughter's life, and it's about the lives of the Palestinians and Israelis. And the Israelis themselves cannot afford it. When I ask people, what do you want? They say we want jobs, we want education, and we want health care. We could not have had that -- we couldn't have that because we have occupation. And this needs to end. What the Israelis want is also security. But that also cannot be available as long as Palestinians are insulted and humiliated. Where Azizi in Tunisia created a revolution because he brought the issue of dignity to people's minds.</p><p end="6304" is_meta="false" speaker="Mustafa Barghouthi" start="6244">And every day, thousands of Palestinians dignity is harmed. What we are trying to say to bring light in the end of the tunnel.</p><p end="6364" is_meta="false" speaker="Mustafa Barghouthi" start="6304">When you vote today, don't take away hope. Don't take away light at the end of the tunnel. And let me remind you here with what Plato said. He said, &#8220;We can easily forgive children for being afraid of dark. The tragedy is when grown people are afraid of light."</p></transcript></debate>
