So that would be the right.</p><p end="359" is_meta="true" speaker="David Brooks" start="301">laughter</p><p end="359" is_meta="false" speaker="David Brooks" start="301">That's my last one I'm giving you, Laura.</p><p end="359" is_meta="true" speaker="David Brooks" start="301">laughter</p><p end="359" is_meta="false" speaker="David Brooks" start="301">The lovely and glamorous Mickey Edwards.</p><p end="419" is_meta="false" speaker="Mickey Edwards" start="359">Are you kidding? I wouldn't get 5 percent of the vote.</p><p end="479" is_meta="false" speaker="Laura Ingraham" start="419">Well, "shut down the party," as in, let's say a college basketball coach has a perpetually losing record. You don't then give the coach a raise. You get rid of the coach. So all of the people running the Republican Party, Reince Priebus, nice person. Why are they still employed? And all the people in leadership should be gone, and we should have a new crop of people running it.</p><p end="479" is_meta="false" speaker="Laura Ingraham" start="419">Thank you.</p><p end="479" is_meta="true" speaker="Laura Ingraham" start="419">applause</p><p end="479" is_meta="false" speaker="Laura Ingraham" start="419">The ever-cutting-edge Ralph Reed.</p><p end="539" is_meta="false" speaker="Ralph Reed" start="479">They apparently didn't know that that seat was taken.</p><p end="598" is_meta="false" speaker="David Brooks" start="539">Now, I did this once before, and the competitive juices got going, and I turned into an insufferable jerk attacking the other side. So before I do that, I want to just express my love and admiration for my opponents. We came into this business together, Laura, the slowly aging portrait of Ralph that he keeps in his attic, and I --</p><p end="598" is_meta="true" speaker="David Brooks" start="539">laughter</p><p end="656" is_meta="false" speaker="David Brooks" start="598">And just complete admiration for them, the fact that they -- the Democrats have hired them to burrow within the Republican Party and to destroy it from within, I do not hold against you.</p><p end="656" is_meta="true" speaker="David Brooks" start="598">laughter</p><p end="656" is_meta="false" speaker="David Brooks" start="598">Now, I admit I was on the left at one point. In the '60s, my parents took me to a "be in"</p><p end="656" is_meta="false" speaker="David Brooks" start="598">where hippies would go just to be. And to demonstrate their liberation from money and material things, they threw their wallets into a garbage can. I was five. I saw a five dollar bill on fire in the garbage can. I ran into the fire, grabbed the money and ranaway. And that was my first step over to the right in my life. Kept going. But we had one other influence in my family, which was my grandfather and his father, immigrants,</p><p end="656" is_meta="false" speaker="David Brooks" start="598">lower east side, a Jewish kid trying to make it in the city. We had the attitude, the think Yiddish act British attitude, "We'll fit in." We had the dream of making it in the city which meant making it in this neighborhood where we're standing, in the upper west side, the Upper East Side.</p><p end="720" is_meta="false" speaker="David Brooks" start="656">And that was the -- how the Republican Party was started. It was started by Abraham Lincoln, a poor boy in Illinois who wanted to make it. And he did it when he was in the state legislature, using government to give poor boys and girls the power to make it and achieve social mobility. He created it by creating a state bank to invest, building canals and railroads. He got to the presidency, created railroad legislation, Homestead Act,</p><p end="720" is_meta="false" speaker="David Brooks" start="656">Land-Grant College Act, even introduced the income tax. It was using government to give poor boys and girls a chance to succeed. And that was still around when I got there, when I got to Washington. Ronald Reagan, a much more pragmatic and flexible person than is now portrayed by many people on the right, it was about using government in limited but energetic ways to give poor people a chance to succeed.</p><p end="720" is_meta="false" speaker="David Brooks" start="656">Reagan did it. Is the Republican Party doing it now? I think they have not because they've been so hostile to government. Ronald Reagan was more pragmatic than the current Republican Party.</p><p end="779" is_meta="false" speaker="David Brooks" start="720">It's also no longer 1980. Now if you want to rise and succeed, it's not enough just to work hard and row a boat across the Ohio River like Lincoln. Think of a poor girl who wants to be like Lincoln today. She can't just work hard ferrying people across that river. She grows up probably without a father. She grows up in a chaotic community with low social trust, high economic pressure, few community bonds. To succeed, she's probably going to need some language instruction. She's probably going to need some early -- some protection from early childhood distresses that'll destroy her self-control.</p><p end="779" is_meta="false" speaker="David Brooks" start="720">She's going to need institutions that'll help her build relationships so she can use people as tools for learning throughout life. She's probably going to have to spend 21 years in education to qualify for a middle class job. And so what does the Republican Party today have to say to her? Almost nothing. This party is encased in a simplistic and archaic metric, government versus the market. Government bad, the market good.</p><p end="901" is_meta="false" speaker="David Brooks" start="779">If you're an energy executive or chemical executive, maybe the government is your central pain. If you're that little girl, the government is not your big problem. If you're that little girl, the government, through Pell grants is sometimes the solution at helping you work hard and becoming a better capitalist. Does the Republican Party offeranything? No, which is why Asian Americans, for example, voted against the Republican Party three times to one. The Republican Party has become so hostile to government that they find it very hard to have anything positive to offer. So hostile to government they can't really stand for social mobility, the cause they started with. And so this is a party that has lost the essence of having a positive agenda even in the cause that was its founding principle. And the country knows that. Republicans have lost five out of the last six popular votes in the elections. They've lost the Senate. They should have won.</p><p end="901" is_meta="false" speaker="David Brooks" start="779">They held onto the House by force of redistricting. The Republican party has a 33 percent overall approval rating when the Democrats have 47 percent. You take every rising group in America. The Republican Party is losing that group. Latinos, by 4 to 1.</p><p end="901" is_meta="false" speaker="David Brooks" start="779">Asian Americans, by 3 to 1. African Americans, by 9 to 1. People in single households by 2 to 1. They're getting slaughtered among young people. If this electorate, and the electorate of the 20th century, was made up of 85-year-old men -- white men, the party would be doing awesome.</p><p end="901" is_meta="true" speaker="David Brooks" start="779">laughter</p><p end="901" is_meta="false" speaker="David Brooks" start="779">This party is not that party. This party sometimes looks like the receding roar of a white America that's never coming back and has to move to recapture that. It has -- and what is the people's top criticism of the Republican Party? Recent Gallup poll this week, the top criticism is they do not compromise. So this is a party going down the drain. It's a party that's unwilling to compromise on budgets, unwilling to compromise on guns,</p><p end="901" is_meta="false" speaker="David Brooks" start="779">apparently unwilling to compromise on immigration.</p><p end="962" is_meta="false" speaker="David Brooks" start="901">Bob Bennett of Utah, a very conservative guy, thrown out of the Senate for working with a Democrat. I had lunch with the fourth most conservative member of the Senate -</p><p end="962" is_meta="false" speaker="David Brooks" start="901">- terrified of getting primaried from the right. Unwilling to have any flexibility.</p><p end="962" is_meta="false" speaker="David Brooks" start="901">Becoming an uncompromising party. To me, this is a party that has to tackle two big issues. The first issue is the welfare state, which is making us unsustainable. The second issue is that little girl and the social immobility, the social segmentation that Charles Murray writes about. And my advice to the Republican Party: don't move to the center for the sake of moving to the center. The center is nothing. Move to the center for the sake of that little girl, which is your founding principle, which is social mobility.</p><p end="962" is_meta="false" speaker="David Brooks" start="901">Do right by that little girl and you'll do right by yourself politically. And that means having a positive agenda. It means being more flexible. It means being prudent and sensible, not a party of a red rump of America.</p><p end="1020" is_meta="false" speaker="David Brooks" start="962">And so, I don't necessarily want to call the party to the center just for centrism. But I want to call them back to their essence as a party. And so, I ask you to vote for the proposition. Thank you.[applause]</p><p end="1020" is_meta="false" speaker="Ralph Reed" start="962">Thank you very much. It's great to be here on the Upper West Side of Manhattan, or as I like to refer to it, my mission field.</p><p end="1020" is_meta="true" speaker="Ralph Reed" start="962">laughter</p><p end="1020" is_meta="false" speaker="Ralph Reed" start="962">I feel a little bit more at home since I got to walk past Lincoln Center. Makes me feel a little more at home to know that a Republican president has something named after him in this part of town.</p><p end="1087" is_meta="false" speaker="Ralph Reed" start="1020">And you know, it's good to be here with Mickey Edwards and David Brooks, who was often referred to in Republican ranks as &#8220;Obama's favorite conservative.&#8221; And I'm looking forward to a very lively and spirited debate. You know, I think for those of us who grew up in this party -- and I knocked on doors and walked precincts in my first campaign for a Republican candidate, 35 years ago -- we've seen this movie before.</p><p end="1087" is_meta="false" speaker="Ralph Reed" start="1020">Virtually everything that David just said from that podium would have been said in 1949 after Dewey lost. It would have been said in 1965 after Barry Goldwater lost. It was said in 1977 after Ford lost. It's been said every time the Republicans lose a major election. And I would just say, paraphrasing Mark Twain, &#8220;When it comes to the Republican Party, the premature reports of its death are greatly exaggerated.&#8221;</p><p end="1141" is_meta="false" speaker="Ralph Reed" start="1087">And in fact, I would argue that in spite of a personal defeat for the party's presidential nominee, that in fact, if you look across the board, in spite of the polls that David cited,</p><p end="1141" is_meta="false" speaker="Ralph Reed" start="1087">the Republican Party is institutionally and demographically stronger than it's been in decades. And if you don't believe me, I'll walk you through the statistics. First of all,</p><p end="1141" is_meta="false" speaker="Ralph Reed" start="1087">look where the Republican Party was after Hoover and the Depression: 36 in the Senate,</p><p end="1141" is_meta="false" speaker="Ralph Reed" start="1087">117 in the House. Look where they were after Nixon and Watergate, after those devastating defeats following scandal and humiliation and national failure. And the party's brand then was even lower than it is now. 36 in the Senate, 144 in the House.</p><p end="1204" is_meta="false" speaker="Ralph Reed" start="1141">Even after George H.W. Bush, after his defeat by Bill Clinton, the worst defeat, by the way, for an incumbent president since Hoover in 1932. The Republicans at that point stood at 44 in the Senate and only 166 in the House. You compare that to today where they have 30 governors compared to the Democrats' 20, and there's no question that the Republican governors, whether it's Nikki Haley in South Carolina. or Scott Walker in Wisconsin, or Bobby Jindal in Louisiana, or Chris Christie in New Jersey are among the most popular reformist conservative forward looking governors in the country,</p><p end="1204" is_meta="false" speaker="Ralph Reed" start="1141">reforming education, reforming public sector unions, balancing budgets without raising taxes. The same policies that we're being told are repudiated and dead, and can't be sold anymore, are more popular than ever at the state level.</p><p end="1267" is_meta="false" speaker="Ralph Reed" start="1204">And the truth of the matter is that that's not just at the gubernatorial level. The Republicans elected over 700 state legislators in 2010. They controlled both Houses of 24 legislatures to only 13 for the Democrats. So I tell you what the Democrats are going to find out. They're going to find out that second terms of two-term presidents aren't a lot of fun. For Eisenhower, it was the recession, Sputnik, and a heart attack. For Nixon,</p><p end="1267" is_meta="false" speaker="Ralph Reed" start="1204">it was Watergate and Vietnam. For Clinton, it was impeachment. For Reagan, it was the loss of the Senate, and ideological control of the House in '86, and Iran Contra. And, of course, George W. Bush, Katrina, and Iraq. Second terms aren't a lot of fun, and there's only been one president in the post-World War II period who won House seats in his second off year election as a two-term president, and that was Bill Clinton in 1998.</p><p end="1321" is_meta="false" speaker="Ralph Reed" start="1267">So just keep that in mind when you listen to all these premature obituaries. I'll quote you one from 1993. This was by the then outgoing RNC chairman, and he said, "We should not cling to zealotry masquerading as principle and stale ideas of a dead and dying past." Sixteen months later, the Republicans gained control of the House and Senate for the first time in 40 years. My second point would be we've tried this before.</p><p end="1321" is_meta="false" speaker="Ralph Reed" start="1267">This formula's been applied. If you don't believe me, go to California, a state that once produced Nixon, Reagan, [unintelligible], and other great conservatives. They moved to the mushy middle. They nominated candidates for statewide office that were pro-</p><p end="1321" is_meta="false" speaker="Ralph Reed" start="1267">choice, pro-gay rights, and fiscally moderate.</p><p end="1387" is_meta="false" speaker="Ralph Reed" start="1321">And today it is fair to say that the Republican Party stands on the verge of extinction,</p><p end="1387" is_meta="false" speaker="Ralph Reed" start="1321">having followed these same policies that are being recommended now. Only 25 out of 80 in the California assembly are Republicans, only 11 of 40 in the state Senate,following this same playbook that's now being recommended nationally. And the other thing I would remind you is this is not going to be a freebie. If the Republican Party walks away from core conservative convictions -- remember that 27 percent of the electorate is self-identified evangelical Christian, 10 percent are frequently mass-</p><p end="1387" is_meta="false" speaker="Ralph Reed" start="1321">attending, pro-life, pro-family Catholics. They voted 75 to 25 percent for Mitt Romney.</p><p end="1387" is_meta="false" speaker="Ralph Reed" start="1321">That constituency is larger than the African-American vote, the Hispanic vote, and the Union vote combined. And if this party retreats from those core conservative principles,</p><p end="1387" is_meta="false" speaker="Ralph Reed" start="1321">those folks will stay home or support a third party, and then the Republican Party will become the Whig Party.</p><p end="1445" is_meta="false" speaker="Ralph Reed" start="1387">One last thing because I'm running out of time. I'm an old high school and collegiate debater. Defining terms really matters, and we're in a debate. And remember what this resolution says. It says the Republican Party must seize the center, that is to say become a party that splits the difference between where it is now and where the Democrats are, basically become a Democrat light, or it will die. It doesn't say, "lose elections.&#8221; It doesn't say, "under perform among minorities."</p><p end="1445" is_meta="true" speaker="Ralph Reed" start="1387">laughter</p><p end="1445" is_meta="false" speaker="Ralph Reed" start="1387">It says, "it will die." Now, based on what I have just told you about the state of the Republican Party today, there is no way, intellectually, to agree with that resolution.</p><p end="1445" is_meta="false" speaker="Ralph Reed" start="1387">Thank you very much.</p><p end="1505" is_meta="false" speaker="Mickey Edwards" start="1445">John, thank you.[applause]</p><p end="1505" is_meta="false" speaker="Mickey Edwards" start="1445">Well, it's a great privilege to be able to be here at Intelligence Squared. Thank you very much for doing this. It's great to be here with my friend, David Brooks, and also to be here with my friends Laura Ingraham and Ralph Reed who have devoted so much of their lives to fighting for principles they believe in. And I admire them both. I hope they lose badly, but I admire them both. I think the question here tonight is -- to put it even more bluntly: do the positions that they are speaking in behalf of serve this country well?</p><p end="1574" is_meta="false" speaker="Mickey Edwards" start="1505">And if they do not, if they do not stand for where America is and where America is going, what claim can they make for support from the American people who find a party that is increasingly at odds with the new, more tolerant, more diverse population that is going to elect America's political leaders for years to come? The fact is, Ralph, this is not the country of 1964 that the party recovered from. It's going to be much harder to recover in a society that looks like the one we have become. Let me be clear. I do not think the problem is that the Republican Party is conservative. The problem is that what it advocates -- what they advocate very sincerely is not at all consistent with what American conservatives have traditionally stood for, certainly not in the days of Ronald Reagan, who almost definitely could not win a Republican primary today.</p><p end="1620" is_meta="false" speaker="Mickey Edwards" start="1574">It's not consistent with the days when the Republican Party stood for things like prudence and responsibility and they did not attempt to dictate to the people how they were supposed to live and what their values were supposed to be. I spent a good many years championing the Republican Party and conservatism. Among the other things,</p><p end="1620" is_meta="false" speaker="Mickey Edwards" start="1574">besides chairing the American Conservative Union and the Conservative Political Action Conference, I chaired Ronald Reagan's 1980 policy task forces for his election. And I have watched this country change, and I have watched the Republican Party also change in the opposite direction. Americans still agree with conservative principles.</p><p end="1677" is_meta="false" speaker="Mickey Edwards" start="1620">They defend the right of citizens to own guns. But they don't applaud a party that supports people being able to carry loaded guns across state lines and into restaurants and schools and churches. The people support conservatism, but they don't support a political party that can't refrain from carrying every sound and defensible principle to its unacceptable extremes. You know, Ralph quoted people like Bobby Jindal, who has been giving speeches saying that what you're advocating will destroy the RepublicanParty. The people will support a political party that wants a smaller deficit and lower taxes and small government, but they're not going to support a party that draws the line, and when they're offered a chance to have lower taxes and smaller government,</p><p end="1677" is_meta="false" speaker="Mickey Edwards" start="1620">they say, &#8220;No, we're unwilling to compromise, accept any kind of a tax increase,&#8221; who are willing to say that compromise is bad, compromise is evil.</p><p end="1742" is_meta="false" speaker="Mickey Edwards" start="1677">You know, I'll tell you, compromise is what makes a nation of 300 million people work.</p><p end="1742" is_meta="false" speaker="Mickey Edwards" start="1677">And without compromise, drawing a line in the sand, you can't make it.</p><p end="1742" is_meta="true" speaker="Mickey Edwards" start="1677">applause</p><p end="1742" is_meta="false" speaker="Mickey Edwards" start="1677">Real conservatives support free enterprise and small business but not giant corporations with giant tax loopholes. And yet today's Republican Party would fight to the death to protect every single tax advantage of the wealthy, so they leave it to the middle class to pay for the wars and the roads and keeping the drinking water safe. So we have two questions, and one of them goes directly to a point that Ralph made. What does it mean to move to the center? I would not suggest that moving to the center means finding some precise magical spot on the 50-yard line of public opinion, but engaging in a rational politics that is within the range of reasonable and thoughtful discourse, a politics that stands for principle, as Ralph and Laura do, but also stands for the principle that self-government, government of the people, works.</p><p end="1804" is_meta="false" speaker="Mickey Edwards" start="1742">And in a nation of 300 million people, that means not just drawing a line in the sand, but fighting for what you believe, make your case, argue for it, get as much as you can and then find the common ground so that we can move together as one people, as one America. That's what the American people don't see.</p><p end="1804" is_meta="true" speaker="Mickey Edwards" start="1742">applause</p><p end="1804" is_meta="false" speaker="Mickey Edwards" start="1742">That's what the American people do not see in today's Republican Party. So people are fleeing from the political parties largely because of the dysfunction in Washington that traces back in large part to the kinds of people the Republican Party attracts and nominates for office. Will it doom the Republican Party? You saw Barack Obama with his numbers down and the economy in a mess get reelected. Laura has written that it's Mitt Romney's fault. Why did Mitt Romney do things that alienated the people? It's the only way you can win a Republican primary today, is to say the kinds of things that he did.</p><p end="1804" is_meta="true" speaker="Mickey Edwards" start="1742">applause</p><p end="1860" is_meta="false" speaker="Mickey Edwards" start="1804">So the -- and in terms of the other things, the nonpresidential races, we had this great chance in the Republican Party to win control of the Senate. Everybody thought we would win control. Democrats were going to lose control of the Senate. In fact, they gained seats. Why did they gain seats? Because Republicans put up candidates that allowed Democrats to win the Senate seats in Delaware, Nevada, Missouri, Indiana, who -- those were states where people were inclined to think good of Republicans, but they just could not go there. So the other question is what it means to be a political party.</p><p end="1860" is_meta="false" speaker="Mickey Edwards" start="1804">And it's not just about catering to whatever part of the population one agrees with, but being a serious contributor to the governance of America. So what's really at stake here are two things: Whether a hardcore, unyielding, uncompromising Republican Party can survive, and second, whether it should.</p><p end="1921" is_meta="false" speaker="Mickey Edwards" start="1860">The Republican Party must come back to the conversation, to the deliberation, to the search for common ground, to that broad range that makes up the rational center, or it,</p><p end="1921" is_meta="false" speaker="Mickey Edwards" start="1860">my party, will disappear, and it should. Please vote for the proposition.</p><p end="1921" is_meta="true" speaker="Mickey Edwards" start="1860">applause</p><p end="1921" is_meta="false" speaker="Laura Ingraham" start="1860">Great to be here. And I have deep admiration for all of my co-panelist debaters. No snarky comments. All of them contribute to the dialogue, and I really appreciate the opportunity to be here. Last -- on Saturday, I was at the NRA 500. Do you guys know what that is?</p><p end="1981" is_meta="false" speaker="Laura Ingraham" start="1921">Anyone in Manhattan know -- it was a NASCAR race in Dallas. What a great country it is.</p><p end="1981" is_meta="false" speaker="Laura Ingraham" start="1921">I could be at the NRA 500, be here with you today. Is there any crossover audience, any people -- oh, none. Darn. I'm totally losing already. I'm a duck out of -- I'm a duck out of water, okay? I'm really a duck out of water here because for me, a centrist is someone who owns only two guns.[laughter]</p><p end="1981" is_meta="false" speaker="Laura Ingraham" start="1921">Oh, come on. I have a question, if this thing is tied by the end, does the Supreme Court actually pick the winner like in 2000? Can we actually get Justice Scalia to write the opinion? I have to say that debating with David Brooks and Mickey Edwards, the politics -- David Brooks, an esteemed columnist for the New York Times, in New York is like -- it's like Barack Obama debating Wayne LaPierre about gun control at a gun show, okay?</p><p end="1981" is_meta="false" speaker="Laura Ingraham" start="1921">The odds are definitely stacked against us. But you must vote against this proposition.</p><p end="1981" is_meta="false" speaker="Laura Ingraham" start="1921">A couple of points first to Mickey's argument.</p><p end="2041" is_meta="false" speaker="Laura Ingraham" start="1981">If Mickey's argument is correct, then one would think that in the bluest of states, which would be very hospitable to moderate Republican views, quote, "centrist views," people like Scott Brown would be victorious. Scott Brown obviously went down in flames. One would think that someone like the very centrist Tommy Thompson of Wisconsin would have won his Senate seat. Unfortunately Tommy Thompson, thought of as a middle-of-</p><p end="2041" is_meta="false" speaker="Laura Ingraham" start="1981">the-road Republican, went down in flames. Republicans had their issues, but for every Todd Aiken and Richard Murdoch, I can cite a Republican moderate who could not make the grade. The proposition should be rejected because moderate Republicanism, going to this mythical center, has been tried, and it has failed repeatedly. Last two elections.</p><p end="2041" is_meta="false" speaker="Laura Ingraham" start="1981">The Republican Party already died. It died in 2000 with the elite's choice, which was John McCain. Remember, back then, Mitt Romney was the insurgent candidate. I supported Mitt Romney in 2008.</p><p end="2107" is_meta="false" speaker="Laura Ingraham" start="2041">He was going up against John McCain, who was for immigration reform. He worked for Ted Kennedy on a bunch of issues. He was for McCain-Feingold. John McCain was the media's favorite Republican. John McCain went down in flames. Move forward to the last election. Everyone said, &#8220;The only guy who could beat Barack Obama would be Mitt Romney. Couldn't be that Rick Santorum. Certainly couldn't be Newt Gingrich.&#8221; Gosh,</p><p end="2107" is_meta="false" speaker="Laura Ingraham" start="2041">Jon Huntsman, the other moderate Republican, he got no traction. Lo and behold, Mitt Romney ran. Mitt Romney lost. Moderates usually lose elections with few exceptions.</p><p end="2107" is_meta="false" speaker="Laura Ingraham" start="2041">And before you pull out the &#8220;Chris Christie is a moderate and everybody loves him&#8221;</p><p end="2339" is_meta="false" speaker="Laura Ingraham" start="2286">You must resist -- thank you.</p><p end="2524" is_meta="false" speaker="Laura Ingraham" start="2464">Yeah, well, I -- again, I think that the center is a moving target. When you say "seize the center," which is the proposition of the debate, what does that mean? I'm looking at the [unintelligible] hole that --</p><p end="2524" is_meta="false" speaker="Laura Ingraham" start="2464">Well, a compromise over what? If you compromise over the core principles of your party, then you are ultimately representing nothing, and you might as well just be a shimmer or a figurehead, representing nothing. So compromise on, "Well, we're going to spend X amount of money versus Y amount of money," oh, that's compromise, I understand what you're saying. But when you say "seizing the center," that stands for a set of principles. In the liberal lexicon, seizing the center for Barack Obama never meant, "Okay, I'm going to actually now look at the way we spend our military money or the way we run our foreign policy differently."</p><p end="2583" is_meta="false" speaker="Laura Ingraham" start="2524">He doesn't believe that's seizing the center. Compromise only exists when it sets about to erode conservative principles.</p><p end="2583" is_meta="false" speaker="Laura Ingraham" start="2524">John Donvan:So you're saying there are situations where there cannot be compromise, where --</p><p end="2583" is_meta="false" speaker="Laura Ingraham" start="2524">Well, yes. Yes, I am.</p><p end="2583" is_meta="false" speaker="David Brooks" start="2524">Well, I guess the first thing I've noticed about this debate so far is our esteemed opponents are mostly talking tactics and we're mostly talking substance.</p><p end="2583" is_meta="true" speaker="David Brooks" start="2524">applause</p><p end="2583" is_meta="false" speaker="Laura Ingraham" start="2524">No, actually not.</p><p end="2583" is_meta="false" speaker="David Brooks" start="2524">So they've talked about how to win elections. Mickey and I have talked about how to solve problems. Mickey talked about the problems of political dysfunction in Washington, and that's to start with a position and then behave in a prudential manner to try to ease political dysfunction in politics, and that's a centrist position, which involves the practice of patriotic service to the country, understanding there are two sides and both sides contain some truth. I talked about social segmentation, a problem that Charles Murray has talked about, a problem that I think can be addressed with limited but energetic government.</p><p end="2641" is_meta="false" speaker="David Brooks" start="2583">We've talked about how to solve those two problems, so neither of us has talked about moving to the center --</p><p end="2641" is_meta="false" speaker="Mickey Edwards" start="2583">You know, it's not about the party standing for itself. It's about the party standing for the country. You know --[applause]</p><p end="2641" is_meta="false" speaker="Mickey Edwards" start="2583">-- James Madison is my hero. I love Madison, the champion of limited government. But he was also for government. The Constitution was not just to put constraints on government but to empower government to act in a reasonable, rational way as a nation. This is not a collection of disparate ideas. This is a full-fledged nation of people who must come together if they're going to do anything worthwhile. Government doesn't have all the power.</p><p end="2704" is_meta="false" speaker="Mickey Edwards" start="2641">Government doesn't have all the responsibility, but government does have some responsibility. And that's where the Republican Party is copping out.</p><p end="2704" is_meta="false" speaker="Ralph Reed" start="2641">Well, I would say, first of all, to David's point, David, what we've been debating is the resolution. And what the resolution says is that the Republican Party must move to the center or die. Now, I haven't heard the other side define these terms. I offered my definition. I'll give you a further definition from Merriam&#8217;s, which is &#8220;The center is the middle point that is equidistant to both end points on a sphere,&#8221; okay?</p><p end="2704" is_meta="true" speaker="Ralph Reed" start="2641">laughter</p><p end="2704" is_meta="false" speaker="Ralph Reed" start="2641">That's what the center is. So we're not going to let you off the hook by saying, you can be a conservative, but you've got to compromise. The resolution makes it very clear that the point to which you must compromise is the point that is equidistant between Democrats and Republicans.</p><p end="2762" is_meta="false" speaker="Ralph Reed" start="2704">The resolution further says that if the Republican Party doesn't do that, that it will die.</p><p end="2762" is_meta="false" speaker="Laura Ingraham" start="2704">I want to add to that. I mean, the argument that Mickey and David are making -- and that I would say it's not a substantive argument.</p><p end="2823" is_meta="false" speaker="Laura Ingraham" start="2762">I would say American greatness conservatism, which was at the crux of much of what David Brooks argued for during the Bush years, supporting a larger, more energetic federal government, supporting not only the war in Iraq, but the war in Afghanistan. It was an utter failure. It grew the deficit. It ended up losing the Republicans, their hard-</p><p end="2823" is_meta="false" speaker="Laura Ingraham" start="2762">fought gains in the Senate and the House of Representatives. And by the end of this moving to the center of the Bush administration, the Republicans had lost the House,</p><p end="2823" is_meta="false" speaker="Laura Ingraham" start="2762">the Senate and turned the White House over to the most liberal president ever to step foot in 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue. So the Republican Party moved to the center, David Brooks -- I like you very much -- and it got clobbered. And only when it moved away from the --</p><p end="2823" is_meta="false" speaker="Laura Ingraham" start="2762">-- center did it win in 2010.</p><p end="2823" is_meta="false" speaker="David Brooks" start="2762">Let me think about the --</p><p end="2823" is_meta="false" speaker="David Brooks" start="2762">-- the centrist Republican Party we've seen over the last ten years. The centrism of Tom Delay, the centrism of Newt Gingrich.</p><p end="2823" is_meta="false" speaker="Laura Ingraham" start="2762">George Bush.</p><p end="2823" is_meta="false" speaker="David Brooks" start="2762">The centrism of Mitt Romney. We talked about makers versus takers who had a deportationist immigration policy.</p><p end="2880" is_meta="false" speaker="David Brooks" start="2823">We have not seen a centrist Republican party.</p><p end="2880" is_meta="false" speaker="Laura Ingraham" start="2823">Was Bush centrist?</p><p end="2880" is_meta="false" speaker="David Brooks" start="2823">No. He was --</p><p end="2880" is_meta="false" speaker="Laura Ingraham" start="2823">He wasn't?</p><p end="2880" is_meta="false" speaker="David Brooks" start="2823">No.</p><p end="2880" is_meta="false" speaker="Laura Ingraham" start="2823">Okay. Well, I haven't seen that column written by you.</p><p end="2880" is_meta="false" speaker="David Brooks" start="2823">I don't write about Bush so much anymore.</p><p end="2880" is_meta="false" speaker="Laura Ingraham" start="2823">Last time I checked, you were defending the surge in 2008 when the country, the center was against the surge. You wrote a column, June 24, 2008, defending the surge as the right thing to do against the center of the country that was against the war in Iraq. You wrote that column, I didn't.</p><p end="2880" is_meta="false" speaker="David Brooks" start="2823">Wait, did --</p><p end="2880" is_meta="true" speaker="David Brooks" start="2823">applause</p><p end="2880" is_meta="false" speaker="David Brooks" start="2823">I support the surge, and I supported the surge. The surge is not exactly the crucial issue in 21st century American policy.</p><p end="2880" is_meta="false" speaker="Laura Ingraham" start="2823">Iraq is pretty important to me.</p><p end="2880" is_meta="false" speaker="Laura Ingraham" start="2823">Well, we're talking about the center.</p><p end="2945" is_meta="false" speaker="Ralph Reed" start="2880">Yeah, I mean, here, again, those who counsel moderation, trimming your sails, moving to the, quote, "middle," never succeed in winning minority votes. The candidates who do well among minority voters -- and, Mickey, I know when you were one of the most conservative members of the House, serving in the '80s, you regularly won large percentage of the African-American vote in your district.</p><p end="3000" is_meta="false" speaker="Ralph Reed" start="2945">Conservatism is not anathema to minority voters. And in fact the high water mark in the post-World War II period for a Republican presidential candidate in winning Hispanic votes was George W. Bush in 2004. And if you look at that, he won 44 percent of the Hispanic vote. You look at the Hispanics he did well among, he over-performed among self-identified conservatives. 40 percent of Hispanics self-identify as conservatives, 22percent are Evangelical, another 25 percent are faithful Catholics, 2 million of them are small business owners. And that's how you win their votes. Bush won 75 percent of Evangelical Hispanics. They're pro-life, they're pro-marriage, they're for lower taxes.</p><p end="3000" is_meta="false" speaker="Ralph Reed" start="2945">These are conservatives. So you don't -- it's not an either/or.</p><p end="3062" is_meta="false" speaker="Ralph Reed" start="3000">You know, Mike Huckabee who is a pro-life, pro-marriage conservative, won 60 percent of the African-American vote in Arkansas.</p><p end="3062" is_meta="false" speaker="David Brooks" start="3000">There's a lot of chum being thrown in the air, a lot of tracers flying up. The idea we should be debating the surge, that's a little bizarre.</p><p end="3062" is_meta="false" speaker="Laura Ingraham" start="3000">The center -- the center of the country was wrong.</p><p end="3062" is_meta="false" speaker="David Brooks" start="3000">The idea that Republicans did well among Hispanics, it's bizarre. They did not do well among Hispanics.</p><p end="3062" is_meta="false" speaker="Ralph Reed" start="3000">I said when George W. Bush ran, and you said he was a conservative.</p><p end="3062" is_meta="false" speaker="David Brooks" start="3000">Well, he had a much better immigration policy than the current Republican Party does,</p><p end="3062" is_meta="false" speaker="David Brooks" start="3000">I'll grant you that. And he had an immigration policy which involved comprehensive immigration reform. So that's the kind of centrism I can support.</p><p end="3121" is_meta="false" speaker="David Brooks" start="3062">It's an immigration reform that includes something for Democrats, something for Republicans and most of all a lot for the country. It's the sort of immigration reform --</p><p end="3121" is_meta="false" speaker="David Brooks" start="3062">Ralph -- Ralph, come on. Let me finish.</p><p end="3121" is_meta="false" speaker="Ralph Reed" start="3062">Okay.</p><p end="3121" is_meta="false" speaker="David Brooks" start="3062">It's the kind of immigration reform that includes getting new skilled workers into this country. It's the kind of immigration reform that involves increasing economic growth,</p><p end="3121" is_meta="false" speaker="David Brooks" start="3062">welcoming the sort of people into this country who pay taxes over their lifetime and create the country. It's the kind of immigration reform that George Bush supported,</p><p end="3121" is_meta="false" speaker="David Brooks" start="3062">that&#8217;s centrist --</p><p end="3121" is_meta="false" speaker="Ralph Reed" start="3062">Okay.</p><p end="3121" is_meta="false" speaker="David Brooks" start="3062">-- if you want to call that -- let me finish that. It&#8217;s centrist Republican supported, it's the kind of immigration reform that is now in mortal peril because of a Republican Party that has gone to the red rump. And if they defeat this immigration reform in this election --</p><p end="3121" is_meta="false" speaker="David Brooks" start="3062">-- they might as well write a suicide note.</p><p end="3121" is_meta="false" speaker="Laura Ingraham" start="3062">Let me -- let me --</p><p end="3121" is_meta="false" speaker="Laura Ingraham" start="3062">I happen to have a Latina daughter, okay? She's almost eight years old. And I take this issue very seriously.</p><p end="3181" is_meta="false" speaker="Laura Ingraham" start="3121">And I take the issue of immigration seriously. I believe in it. I believe it adds enormously to the fabric of our society. But the resolution on the table is the Republican Party must move to the center or die. And we are arguing about George W.</p><p end="3181" is_meta="false" speaker="Laura Ingraham" start="3121">Bush only because George W. Bush is the most recent national example of a Republican that all the individuals under the age of 35 remember. If you're under 35, the only national Republican you really have any experience with is George W. Bush. And the last time I checked, George W. Bush drove up the deficit, got us involved in two wars that ended up being either badly explained or just wildly unpopular because they didn't seem like they were helping Americans at home and were not all that successful. And I will say that when he left office, he had -- I believe, the last approval rating he had was about 32 percent.</p><p end="3243" is_meta="false" speaker="Laura Ingraham" start="3181">The Republican Party was decimated between 2005 and 2008. And during those years,</p><p end="3243" is_meta="false" speaker="Laura Ingraham" start="3181">there was not a Tea Party. There was no Sarah Palin. This was no issue with the Tea Party influence. It was because we had an abysmally centrist and out of touch George W. Bush in the White House that the Republican Party has still not come to terms with.</p><p end="3243" is_meta="false" speaker="Laura Ingraham" start="3181">And I believe he was in many ways the centrist dream that David Brooks loves.</p><p end="3243" is_meta="false" speaker="Mickey Edwards" start="3181">You know, I feel like I'm watching one of those games where you try to see which shell the pea is under. So, I mean, you guys keep talking about the definitional problem,</p><p end="3243" is_meta="false" speaker="Mickey Edwards" start="3181">we're not defining the issue right, and yet you keep redefining conservatism. I mean,</p><p end="3243" is_meta="false" speaker="Mickey Edwards" start="3181">Ralph, I appreciate the fact that you pointed out that when I was running for Congress,</p><p end="3243" is_meta="false" speaker="Mickey Edwards" start="3181">and when I was there, I routinely carried the African-American vote by good margins.</p><p end="3243" is_meta="false" speaker="Mickey Edwards" start="3181">But, you know, a very interesting thing happened.</p><p end="3303" is_meta="false" speaker="Mickey Edwards" start="3243">There was a political scientist who did a study of me. I can't imagine why he would do that, but he looked -- and he compared my voting record with what it would be today.</p><p end="3303" is_meta="false" speaker="Mickey Edwards" start="3243">And he said, &#8220;Holding things steady&#8221; -- when I was in Congress, you're absolutely right. I was one of the most conservative members of Congress. And if I were in Congress today, voting exactly the same way on exactly the same issues, I would be one of themost liberal Republicans in Congress. It's the party that has changed. That's not the party of Reagan. It's not the party of Barry Goldwater. You know, it's -- this is a party that has become something different and unrecognizable, something that is at war with the American people, that's at war with people's rights --</p><p end="3303" is_meta="false" speaker="Laura Ingraham" start="3243">I don't think that's true --</p><p end="3303" is_meta="false" speaker="Mickey Edwards" start="3243">-- to make their own choices.</p><p end="3303" is_meta="false" speaker="Laura Ingraham" start="3243">If the Republican Party is as out of touch as you claim it to be, how do we have a -- how do we have people like Nikki Haley, Susana Martinez, Ted Cruz?</p><p end="3360" is_meta="false" speaker="Laura Ingraham" start="3303">We have incredible people across this country -- Scott Walker and --</p><p end="3360" is_meta="false" speaker="Mickey Edwards" start="3303">Marco Rubio.</p><p end="3360" is_meta="false" speaker="Laura Ingraham" start="3303">-- Marco Rubio and all these other people.

I mean --</p><p end="3360" is_meta="false" speaker="Laura Ingraham" start="3303">What?</p><p end="3360" is_meta="false" speaker="Mickey Edwards" start="3303">I agree with you on those points.

No. No.</p><p end="3360" is_meta="false" speaker="Laura Ingraham" start="3303">So, first of all -- I want to know --</p><p end="3360" is_meta="false" speaker="Ralph Reed" start="3303">Can I --</p><p end="3360" is_meta="false" speaker="Ralph Reed" start="3303">-- respond to that?</p><p end="3360" is_meta="false" speaker="Ralph Reed" start="3303">I helped them during their campaigns, Mickey.</p><p end="3360" is_meta="false" speaker="Laura Ingraham" start="3303">As did I.</p><p end="3360" is_meta="false" speaker="Ralph Reed" start="3303">I assure you, they agree with me. I don't know about this resolution, but let me say this.</p><p end="3360" is_meta="false" speaker="Ralph Reed" start="3303">I think Laura and I -- I'm not sure, but we -- I don't want to get too down the rabbit trail of immigration. But I think that it elucidates the disagreement we're having. They seem to be saying, or at least Mickey is, that it's okay to be a conservative, you just have to bewilling to compromise. Well, as I understand it, that's not really the resolution. It goes without saying that in the legislative process, you have give-or-take.</p><p end="3424" is_meta="false" speaker="Ralph Reed" start="3360">I mean, if you read this comprehensive immigration proposal that was released this morning, it has the toughest enforcement and border security measures in U.S. history.</p><p end="3424" is_meta="false" speaker="Ralph Reed" start="3360">If you entered this country illegally, the soonest you can get a green card is 13 years.</p><p end="3424" is_meta="false" speaker="Ralph Reed" start="3360">The soonest. For many, it'll be 20 years. And nobody -- but nobody under this bill moved ahead of the 4.7 million people who have played by the rules, obeyed the law,</p><p end="3424" is_meta="false" speaker="Ralph Reed" start="3360">and are waiting in line right now. Not one. Now, that is not amnesty. And I -- even if you don't agree with the bill, I defy anybody to say that what Marco Rubio has done is seize the center. What he has done is he has -- as a brilliant legislator and he's very gifted -- and this is not just me talking. The president has said he's been a positive influence. Chuck Schumer called him a &#8220;game-changer.&#8221; He brought conservative principles to bear, okay?</p><p end="3424" is_meta="false" speaker="David Brooks" start="3360">Okay.

I posited immigration reform, which Marco Rubio --</p><p end="3489" is_meta="false" speaker="David Brooks" start="3424">this gang put together as a perfect model, not some abstraction of George Bush as a centrist, which I do not remember really, but a concrete thing we can argue about as an example of the sort of governance I think Mickey and I agree with.

Do not interrupt me, please. Charlie Crist, who is now a Democrat. Charlie Crist's positions in Florida were widely hailed by liberal Republicans and liberals, period. He also happened to be unseated by the Tea Party. I had Marco Rubio on my radio show in February of 2009. He was 23 points behind. I saw in Marco Rubio someone different from the Republican dinosaur establishment, the same people who had driven the party, from Bush on down, into almost oblivion. All the gains we won during Gingrich were lost almost under George W.</p><p end="3543" is_meta="false" speaker="Laura Ingraham" start="3489">Bush. Marco Rubio is a different type of legislator. It doesn't mean I'm going to agree with him on everything.</p><p end="3611" is_meta="false" speaker="Laura Ingraham" start="3543">But I like what he&#8217;s trying to do with the national conversation.</p><p end="3611" is_meta="false" speaker="Laura Ingraham" start="3543">I don't think he's -- I think he's -- he had the idea of immigration reform seven years ago.</p><p end="3611" is_meta="false" speaker="Ralph Reed" start="3543">Not by any -- no.</p><p end="3611" is_meta="false" speaker="Laura Ingraham" start="3543">Seven years ago.</p><p end="3611" is_meta="false" speaker="Ralph Reed" start="3543">You cannot say that Marco Rubio is a moderate by any intellectually defensible analysis -</p><p end="3611" is_meta="false" speaker="Ralph Reed" start="3543">-</p><p end="3611" is_meta="false" speaker="Laura Ingraham" start="3543">Pro-life, pro-traditional marriage, against [unintelligible] --</p><p end="3611" is_meta="false" speaker="Ralph Reed" start="3543">-- of America's political --</p><p end="3611" is_meta="true" speaker="Ralph Reed" start="3543">talking simultaneously</p><p end="3611" is_meta="false" speaker="Ralph Reed" start="3543">Well, and I would go further and say that, you know -- again, to point out what Laura was saying, if you think Marco Rubio's a moderate, I urge you to go home after tonight's session and read his speech to CPAC a couple of weeks ago, where he began his speech by defending the definition of traditional marriage, where he began by defending the sanctity of innocent human life.</p><p end="3658" is_meta="false" speaker="Laura Ingraham" start="3611">Last few days.</p><p end="3658" is_meta="false" speaker="Ralph Reed" start="3611">-- that shows that 53 percent of the American people favor restrictions on abortion or having it banned entirely.

My point is if we had had this debate at an earlier time, they would've been saying, "You need to moderate your stance on that issue." We didn&#8217;t. We've done fine without moderating it.

What happened with Marco Rubio was he got elected, and he became a member of the United States Senate, and he said, "I've taken an oath of office for the Constitution, and my job is to help govern America."

Is that centrist?</p><p end="3720" is_meta="false" speaker="Mickey Edwards" start="3658">-- cannot be that you never compromise on anything, you know? And that's the reputation the Republican Party is getting, the party of "No." You don't say, "No," to America. You say, "I've taken an oath of office. I'm a member of government. I have to try to make something happen." And that's what Marco Rubio has done.</p><p end="3720" is_meta="true" speaker="Mickey Edwards" start="3658">applause</p><p end="3720" is_meta="false" speaker="David Brooks" start="3658">I really think -- I --</p><p end="3720" is_meta="false" speaker="David Brooks" start="3658">John Donvan:David Brooks.</p><p end="3720" is_meta="true" speaker="David Brooks" start="3658">talking simultaneously</p><p end="3720" is_meta="false" speaker="David Brooks" start="3658">David Brooks. I -- let me come back to you guys after this.</p><p end="3720" is_meta="false" speaker="David Brooks" start="3658">I mean, I just think you guys aren't listening to us.</p><p end="3720" is_meta="true" speaker="David Brooks" start="3658">laughter</p><p end="3720" is_meta="false" speaker="David Brooks" start="3658">When we are talking about --</p><p end="3720" is_meta="false" speaker="Laura Ingraham" start="3658">Where's Dr. Phil?</p><p end="3720" is_meta="false" speaker="David Brooks" start="3658">-- in moderation -- we're not talking about being --</p><p end="3720" is_meta="false" speaker="Laura Ingraham" start="3658">We need Dr. Phil here.</p><p end="3720" is_meta="true" speaker="Laura Ingraham" start="3658">laughter</p><p end="3720" is_meta="false" speaker="David Brooks" start="3658">Hear me.</p><p end="3787" is_meta="false" speaker="David Brooks" start="3720">So -- Mickey and I have consistently -- when we talked about moderation, we have not said, "You have to be without principles." We have not said, "You have to be some invisible squish." We say, "You start with your principles. First, you address your real principles to real problems like the economy and immigration. And then you try to work with the people on the other side who contain some piece of the truth." Now, what's happened to the Republican Party is that it shifted, and people who used to be thought of as "conservatives" are now thought of as "moderates." First there was Mickey. Now there's Ralph.[laughter]</p><p end="3787" is_meta="false" speaker="David Brooks" start="3720">You&#8217;ve turned Ralph -- you, with your immigration position, you've turned Ralph into a squish.</p><p end="3787" is_meta="true" speaker="David Brooks" start="3720">laughter</p><p end="3787" is_meta="false" speaker="Ralph Reed" start="3720">David, David, nice try. I don't think anybody's buying that I'm a moderate.</p><p end="3787" is_meta="false" speaker="Laura Ingraham" start="3720">John, John --</p><p end="3787" is_meta="false" speaker="Ralph Reed" start="3720">Can I just say this --</p><p end="3787" is_meta="false" speaker="Ralph Reed" start="3720">I think this is a part of the false premise of the other side. We have never taken the position nor does the resolution require us to take the position that in the give and take of a legislative process or a negotiation between a governor and legislature that you compromise.</p><p end="3840" is_meta="false" speaker="Ralph Reed" start="3787">You don't get off that easy. That's not what this resolution says. What this resolution says is that the Republican Party should cease to be the party of unalloyed, authentic,</p><p end="3840" is_meta="false" speaker="Ralph Reed" start="3787">unapologetic conservatism and should instead try to split the difference between where it is and where the Democrats are. Let me just let you in on a little secret, A, that won't work politically; and, B, it ain't happening.</p><p end="3840" is_meta="false" speaker="Ralph Reed" start="3787">It's not going to happen.</p><p end="3840" is_meta="false" speaker="Ralph Reed" start="3787">John Donvan:Ralph --</p><p end="3840" is_meta="false" speaker="Ralph Reed" start="3787">The Democrats are on the left. The Republicans are on the right. And there are lots of reasons for that that we could get into.</p><p end="3917" is_meta="false" speaker="Ralph Reed" start="3840">Well, I think conservatism in a nutshell is a philosophy that argues that as government gets bigger, that freedom necessarily constricts. And we believe people are best able to rise as high and as far as their God-given talents, abilities, ambitions, and desires will carry them when government gets out of the way and allows free men and women to do those things that are best left to them. Government should be small. It should be limited, and it should be confined to specific enumerated purposes.</p><p end="3917" is_meta="false" speaker="Ralph Reed" start="3840">Well, I'm happy --</p><p end="3917" is_meta="false" speaker="Laura Ingraham" start="3840">Media -- well, I'll chime in here.</p><p end="3980" is_meta="false" speaker="Laura Ingraham" start="3917">-- government has no role in it. But reality actually matters.</p><p end="3980" is_meta="false" speaker="Ralph Reed" start="3917">By the way, it fits in in the same place that the Civil Rights Act of 1964 fits in, okay? I'm not allowed to deny you the right to sit at a lunch counter simply because of the color of your skin. And we believe that if you take, for example, the issue of abortion, that an unborn child is a person for purposes of the 14th amendment of the Constitution;</p><p end="3980" is_meta="false" speaker="Ralph Reed" start="3917">therefore, to take their life without due process, as we're seeing unfold in this gruesome trial in Pennsylvania, with this doctor who systemically executed children who could perform outside the womb, violated their God-given right, and by the way, their Constitutional right to life and liberty and the pursuit of happiness.</p><p end="4022" is_meta="false" speaker="Mickey Edwards" start="3980">Yeah, I have some thoughts here, but I kind of got stunned here by this definition of liberty. So in the case of the civil rights and you cannot deny African-Americans,</p><p end="4022" is_meta="false" speaker="Mickey Edwards" start="3980">obviously you shouldn't, these rights, you know, that's a good thing. But denying gays rights, that's different, right?</p><p end="4022" is_meta="false" speaker="Mickey Edwards" start="3980">[applause]So, I mean, there&#8217;s a point where you're not being consistent, are you for liberty, or are you for restrictions on liberty? Are you for a workable government, or are you against it?</p><p end="4085" is_meta="false" speaker="Mickey Edwards" start="4022">Are you for limited government or not? I mean, you're on every side of everything.</p><p end="4085" is_meta="false" speaker="Mickey Edwards" start="4022">That doesn't work.</p><p end="4085" is_meta="false" speaker="Ralph Reed" start="4022">Can I respond to that?</p><p end="4085" is_meta="false" speaker="Ralph Reed" start="4022">Well, I would say, first of all, gays and lesbians have not experienced the same level of Jim Crow-like invidious historic discrimination that African-Americans did.</p><p end="4143" is_meta="false" speaker="Ralph Reed" start="4085">They've not -- wait a minute. They've not been denied the right to vote. They've not been prevented to run for political office. If you believe that gays and lesbians were subjected to slavery and segregation and denied the right to vote for over 100 years after the 13th amendment granted them the right to vote, that has never happened in American history. So they are free in a free society to make moral choices with which I may disagree. Just by the way straights are. There are straight men and women who live together outside of wedlock, do so every day, and they're free to do so in a free society. I'm not going in there to try to interfere with their personal decision. The issue before the country is whether or not that relationship should be defined as the institution of marriage.</p><p end="4206" is_meta="false" speaker="Laura Ingraham" start="4143">I'm not married, but I'm glad -- is there a husband out there -- oh, great.</p><p end="4206" is_meta="false" speaker="Laura Ingraham" start="4143">"Ms." is fine. I'm bought into that now.</p><p end="4206" is_meta="false" speaker="Laura Ingraham" start="4143">Yeah, I've evolved.</p><p end="4206" is_meta="false" speaker="Laura Ingraham" start="4143">I'm centrist, David.</p><p end="4206" is_meta="false" speaker="David Brooks" start="4143">Centrist, yeah, like Bush.</p><p end="4206" is_meta="false" speaker="Laura Ingraham" start="4143">What can I say?</p><p end="4206" is_meta="false" speaker="Ralph Reed" start="4143">So now it's all four on one side.</p><p end="4260" is_meta="false" speaker="Laura Ingraham" start="4206">I was a -- very briefly, I was a kid growing up in Connecticut. My mom was a waitress. I had a middle class lifestyle. I kind of gravitated toward Reagan. I didn't really have any reason to be political. But this guy was kind of an older guy, but he seemed to love America, and he thought government was kind of out of control. I saw my parents in these gas lines, and interest rates are really high. Parents couldn't make much more money. Listened to him and thought that message made sense. The Reagan experience was not without its pitfalls. Reagan did compromise on some issues. But that vision of conservatism, which was a happy warrior conservatism, which was unyielding in the face of the Soviet threat, which understood that the power of the individual, individual prosperity, was best achieved with a government that didn't get in the way. Those messages were clearly stated, mostly optimistically stated. But he could throw the punches when necessary.</p><p end="4320" is_meta="false" speaker="Laura Ingraham" start="4260">Reagan was a great example for me as a young person. I think as time went on, they had some successes obviously in the '90s. Republicans took the House of Representatives for the first time in 50 years in 1994. Seemed like we were back on track. And George Bush -- I mean, I sound like I'm beating up on George Bush, but George Bush comes along, I like him very much. We had an idea that Republicanism --</p><p end="4320" is_meta="false" speaker="Laura Ingraham" start="4260">-- needed to expanded.</p><p end="4320" is_meta="false" speaker="Laura Ingraham" start="4260">John Donvan:Laura, just in terms of --</p><p end="4320" is_meta="false" speaker="Laura Ingraham" start="4260">The Republican Party turned its back on core conservative principles. Conservatism was never about remaking the world in its image. Conservatism was not about starting wars that we didn't have clear exit paths with. And it wasn't about running up big deficits.</p><p end="4320" is_meta="false" speaker="Laura Ingraham" start="4260">Conservatism became that sadly during the Bush years. And it nearly destroyed the Republican Party. It wasn't the Tea Party in 2010. It was Bush from 2004 to 2008.</p><p end="4320" is_meta="false" speaker="David Brooks" start="4260">I just want to respond to the Reagan revisionism which I knew would come up. It took a lot longer than I thought. So Reagan raised taxes 14 times. He included the biggest tax hike in American history to that point.</p><p end="4381" is_meta="false" speaker="David Brooks" start="4320">Reagan signed the Therapeutic Abortion Act, which was one of the bigger liberalizations of abortion laws. That didn't make him a moderate. It made him someone who was practical politician. And he fought for what he could and tried to get things done, but he was willing to address real problems and not govern on the basis of a prefab ideology.</p><p end="4381" is_meta="false" speaker="Laura Ingraham" start="4320">Was he a centrist?</p><p end="4381" is_meta="false" speaker="David Brooks" start="4320">No. But he was someone who was willing to govern.</p><p end="4381" is_meta="false" speaker="Laura Ingraham" start="4320">He took on the Republican orthodoxy which was made up of centrists. From 1976 onward and years before that, he debated everybody from RFK to Republican --</p><p end="4381" is_meta="false" speaker="Laura Ingraham" start="4320">Rockefeller Republicans, many of whom would probably agree with a lot of the points you're making and you're making well.</p><p end="4381" is_meta="false" speaker="David Brooks" start="4320">Right. So, well, maybe two ways. Ronald Reagan adjusted to the problems of his day.</p><p end="4381" is_meta="false" speaker="David Brooks" start="4320">In the late 1970s, there was a stagflation. There was a global shift of overregulation.</p><p end="4381" is_meta="false" speaker="David Brooks" start="4320">There was a global shift of government which really did stagnate the country.</p><p end="4439" is_meta="false" speaker="David Brooks" start="4381">And Ronald Reagan, I think, responded very intelligently, along with Margaret Thatcher,</p><p end="4439" is_meta="false" speaker="David Brooks" start="4381">to the problems of those days. The problem is the problem of 2013, it's not 1980, and the problems are different. And if you stay with some mythical, pure Reaganism, which includes no tax increases ever, small government all the way, which is mythical, then you are not responding to the problems of today.</p><p end="4439" is_meta="false" speaker="Laura Ingraham" start="4381">Where are the centrists winning, and where are there centrists making a difference in government today? What centrist Republican has won and changed the face of the Republican Party? Where? Where is it happening? It didn't happen in California.</p><p end="4439" is_meta="false" speaker="David Brooks" start="4381">Okay. Well, we're sitting in New York City.</p><p end="4439" is_meta="false" speaker="Laura Ingraham" start="4381">At the Bloomberg?</p><p end="4439" is_meta="false" speaker="David Brooks" start="4381">We just had a couple of mayors of New York City who were, I would say, moderate Republicans, probably pretty good for New York. I'd say Governor Chris Christie would be good for New Jersey.</p><p end="4439" is_meta="false" speaker="Laura Ingraham" start="4381">He won with the Tea Party, David.</p><p end="4439" is_meta="false" speaker="David Brooks" start="4381">I would say outside the Washington, D.C. and some of the red states, it's impossible to become a centrist because --</p><p end="4439" is_meta="false" speaker="Laura Ingraham" start="4381">They're not winning. That's the whole point.</p><p end="4497" is_meta="false" speaker="Ralph Reed" start="4439">Can I -- can I quickly --</p><p end="4497" is_meta="false" speaker="Ralph Reed" start="4439">Okay. All right.</p><p end="4497" is_meta="false" speaker="Ralph Reed" start="4439">Right.</p><p end="4576" is_meta="false" speaker="Laura Ingraham" start="4497">Yeah.</p><p end="4576" is_meta="false" speaker="Ralph Reed" start="4497">Yeah.</p><p end="4576" is_meta="false" speaker="Laura Ingraham" start="4497">Yeah.</p><p end="4576" is_meta="true" speaker="Laura Ingraham" start="4497">taking simultaneously</p><p end="4576" is_meta="false" speaker="Ralph Reed" start="4497">If I can respond -- the Party does have that reputation. It is an undeserved reputation,</p><p end="4576" is_meta="false" speaker="Ralph Reed" start="4497">but it nonetheless is the case. But the fact of the matter is that what the Republican Party stands for, what it fights for and what it seeks to advance, is policies that will strengthen marriage, family, childbearing and rearing, so that young people are not left behind in circumstances where this young girl could end up finding herself. We seek policies that strengthen the family, because we know that if somebody gets married and stays married, bears children within the institution of marriage, and gets a job, any job,</p><p end="4576" is_meta="false" speaker="Ralph Reed" start="4497">and graduates from high school -- that person that I just described, in the United States of America, you know what that -- what chance that person has of living in poverty?</p><p end="4621" is_meta="false" speaker="Ralph Reed" start="4576">Two percent. You do the opposite of those four behaviors, you don't graduate from high school, you don't get your first job, you bear children outside the institution of marriage, you have an 85 percent chance of living in poverty. And I read &#8220;Losing Ground.&#8221; And Charles Murray's exactly right. But the sociology and pathology of poverty in America today is largely as a result of government policies that don't strengthen those institutions.</p><p end="4621" is_meta="false" speaker="David Brooks" start="4576">Can I just ask for detail? You mentioned you support --</p><p end="4621" is_meta="false" speaker="David Brooks" start="4576">-- policies that support child-rearing. What exactly are those policies?</p><p end="4621" is_meta="false" speaker="Ralph Reed" start="4576">Well, I can give you a number of examples. Number one, school choice, which we know dramatically increases parental involvement in a child's education, David.</p><p end="4682" is_meta="false" speaker="Ralph Reed" start="4621">All the social science shows that if a parent can choose the school, that they're going to be more involved in that child's education. Secondly, we supported the $500 per child tax credit, which became $1,000 per child tax credit, which we made fully refundable.</p><p end="4682" is_meta="false" speaker="Ralph Reed" start="4621">David, that is the most successful anti-poverty program in the last 30 years. It lifted 9 million people out of poverty last year. That was in the Contract With America.</p><p end="4682" is_meta="false" speaker="Ralph Reed" start="4621">So, the idea --</p><p end="4682" is_meta="false" speaker="Ralph Reed" start="4621">-- can I -- let me give you one more. [inaudible] -- let me give you one more --</p><p end="4682" is_meta="false" speaker="Ralph Reed" start="4621">I've been trying to give an example --</p><p end="4682" is_meta="false" speaker="Ralph Reed" start="4621">What?</p><p end="4682" is_meta="false" speaker="Ralph Reed" start="4621">Yes.</p><p end="4682" is_meta="false" speaker="Ralph Reed" start="4621">If you think that -- I will tell you this. I mean, Bill Clinton vetoed our budget with the child tax credit in it two times. Do you think welfare reform was a moderate idea?</p><p end="4745" is_meta="false" speaker="Laura Ingraham" start="4682">It's not -- the --</p><p end="4745" is_meta="false" speaker="Ralph Reed" start="4682">-- that lift people out of poverty --</p><p end="4745" is_meta="false" speaker="Laura Ingraham" start="4682">And Washington --</p><p end="4745" is_meta="false" speaker="Ralph Reed" start="4682">-- and give them hope. And instead of their hope being in government dependency, it allows them to move to dignity and self-reliance, work, stronger marriages, and families.</p><p end="4745" is_meta="false" speaker="Ralph Reed" start="4682">And that's what's going to lift people out of party, not government programs out of Washington, D.C.</p><p end="4801" is_meta="false" speaker="Mickey Edwards" start="4745">You know, I -- first of all, yes, but here's -- I mean, I agree with a lot of what Ralph said about the positions that he was advocating. You know, those are conservative. But I --</p><p end="4801" is_meta="false" speaker="Mickey Edwards" start="4745">we used to call -- people used to call the Republican Party the "dumb party," and I tried to think, "Why is that? Why is it the dumb party?" So what happens when you have good ideas like the ones you just talked about, and you have the president of the other party and the Senate of the other party, and you want to advance toward what you say,but if they say, "Okay, let's find a compromise," you say, "No," and, therefore, you get nothing, instead of moving in the direction you're advocating, you get nothing. That's dumb. That's really dumb, and that's the reputation the Republican Party is getting.</p><p end="4801" is_meta="true" speaker="Mickey Edwards" start="4745">applause</p><p end="4863" is_meta="false" speaker="Laura Ingraham" start="4801">Well, on the issue of compromise, Barack Obama brooks no compromise on certain issues. Number one, on D.C. Opportunity Scholarships, I don't know if you guys know what that is, but that was a school choice initiative, wildly popular in my hometown of the District of Columbia. African-Americans, Latinos line up around blocks to get their kids enrolled in the D.C. Opportunity Scholarship. The centrist, Barack Obama, zeroed out -- approved the zeroing out of the money, pittance, I think it was $13 million, a drop in the bucket in our budget, for those families. Okay, so the idea that somehow that's compromise or that's -- there's all sorts of compromise going on, on the other side, not when it brooks the teacher's union, not when they're up against their people, so Republicans need to compromise and move to the center, but Democrats on issues like the unions and opportunity scholarships, there's no way they're going to do that. And on the point about the -- about the African-American point, I think it's an important one,</p><p end="4863" is_meta="false" speaker="Laura Ingraham" start="4801">I'd just like to say one brief thing, you're absolutely right.</p><p end="4920" is_meta="false" speaker="Laura Ingraham" start="4863">Republicans have been abysmal, from Romney, to McCain, and to pretty much everybody in between, about talking to people as people. They have different views.</p><p end="4920" is_meta="false" speaker="Laura Ingraham" start="4863">They have different values. That's okay. Rand Paul, Tea Party, not centrist Republican,</p><p end="4920" is_meta="false" speaker="Laura Ingraham" start="4863">is the first Republican to actually really go speak to African-Americans in a meaningful way. He did that last week at Howard University. He was booed for having done so, but I give him great credit for doing that. He began the conversation. I hope it continues,</p><p end="4920" is_meta="false" speaker="Laura Ingraham" start="4863">but you're making an absolutely important and valid point, and we have been terrible at that.</p><p end="4983" is_meta="false" speaker="Ralph Reed" start="4920">Well, the --</p><p end="4983" is_meta="false" speaker="Ralph Reed" start="4920">-- the short answer is, "neither," because there're two rules in American politics. The first is you can be asked any question that the questioner wants to ask you. The second is you can answer it any way you want.</p><p end="5041" is_meta="false" speaker="Ralph Reed" start="4983">And our candidates just didn&#8217;t seem to fully grasp that second rule.</p><p end="5041" is_meta="true" speaker="Ralph Reed" start="4983">laughter</p><p end="5041" is_meta="false" speaker="Ralph Reed" start="4983">They were given a choice of raise your hand. What they should have said was -- and I can't remember who the moderator was, you know, doesn't matter -- but you should say, "That offer will never come. There has never been a time in modern American political history where a Republican president has been offered a deal of a dollar in tax revenue -- new tax revenue for $10 in spending cuts, and it never will happen.&#8221; And, bythe way, you know, David was talking about the tax increase that Reagan signed in 1982,</p><p end="5041" is_meta="false" speaker="Ralph Reed" start="4983">which was then the largest tax increase in American history. I was there. I was working in the U.S. Senate at the time. It was supposed to be $3 in spending cuts for every dollar in tax increases. Reagan signed it. All the taxes went up. The spending never got cut.</p><p end="5102" is_meta="false" speaker="Ralph Reed" start="5041">He never got the spending. He went on to say it was one of the biggest mistakes he made as president. And that's why. If you look at what Obama's proposed, it's basically dollar for dollar. Now at a time when we're spending a trillion dollars a year that we don't have, Republicans are not going to agree to that kind of ratio.</p><p end="5102" is_meta="false" speaker="Mickey Edwards" start="5041">I just wanted to respond to the point in the gentleman's question. What shows you where the Republican Party is, it is -- you mentioned the primaries. It's the primary system where the Republican activist, the true believers, people like you show up. And what happens is you end up with nominees like Christine O'Donnell and Sharon Engel and Richard Murdoch and Denny Rehberg. That's what has to come out of a Republican primary, and that's what's killing the party. It's not some magical moderate or not moderate.</p><p end="5165" is_meta="false" speaker="Mickey Edwards" start="5102">It's that the Republican Party continues to put, on the ballot as its champions saying,</p><p end="5165" is_meta="false" speaker="Mickey Edwards" start="5102">&#8220;This is what we believe,&#8221; people who are so far out of the acceptable mainstream that people just can't accept it.</p><p end="5165" is_meta="false" speaker="David Brooks" start="5102">You know, Ralph's a good consultant. If he had consulted -- if they had asked him before they raised the hand question, he would have given that good advice of how to dodge it. But they didn't just dodge that. They didn't just answer that question. They raised their hand, and then they defended it for the rest of the campaign. They defended the position that $10 in spending was not worth $1 in tax increases. They support that. They believe in that, they talked about it. It was a perfect example of the sort of absolutist position; a position of preference that a lot of us have that taxes shouldn't go up turned into an absolute fetish. And as a result, this party is incapable of reaching a budget deal. Now, I don't support all the budget deals that were out there,but a couple years ago, they were given a budget deal of $3 to one, $3 of spending cuts to $1 of tax increase.</p><p end="5220" is_meta="false" speaker="David Brooks" start="5165">That, to me, was the no-brainer of the century. Take that deal. They didn't take the deal. They lost the election. Now we're down to maybe one to one. This is a party that's incapable of getting to yes.</p><p end="5220" is_meta="false" speaker="Laura Ingraham" start="5165">The centrist president --</p><p end="5220" is_meta="false" speaker="Laura Ingraham" start="5165">-- Barack Obama has produced two budgets, I guess, right? Is that right, two budgets in five years. The last one late. I think it's the first time a president delivered a budget that late in modern history, or maybe ever. And the president's first budget got a total of zero votes for his budget, which apparently would be filled with compromise and moving to the middle and understanding governance and all of that. Got no support.</p><p end="5220" is_meta="false" speaker="Laura Ingraham" start="5165">And it doesn't look like his current budget is getting any support either. So the idea that the Republicans are sitting there as this -- as this buoy in the water, and it will not tact to one direction or the other. It's ridiculous.</p><p end="5283" is_meta="false" speaker="Laura Ingraham" start="5220">The Republicans have tons of problems, believe me. But the idea that if they -- again,</p><p end="5283" is_meta="false" speaker="Laura Ingraham" start="5220">the proposition on the table, they have to move to the center or die. They are alive and well in blue state Wisconsin. They are alive and well in blue state New Mexico where representative Steve Pierce, Republican, anti-immigration reform, just won 41 percent of the Hispanic vote in southern New Mexico by actually, as our --</p><p end="5283" is_meta="false" speaker="Laura Ingraham" start="5220">-- questioner said, talking to the people there, including Latino voters.</p><p end="5283" is_meta="false" speaker="Laura Ingraham" start="5220">No. A centrist, according to your -- no, no, centrist according to your definition, because he is moving with the times.</p><p end="5283" is_meta="false" speaker="Laura Ingraham" start="5220">I don't think he's centrist at all, my gosh. I mean --</p><p end="5283" is_meta="false" speaker="Laura Ingraham" start="5220">He's left the stage he's so left. I mean, come on.</p><p end="5339" is_meta="false" speaker="Mickey Edwards" start="5283">I don't know what you mean.</p><p end="5339" is_meta="false" speaker="Mickey Edwards" start="5283">One of the things that was always very interesting was that during the Bush and Cheney years, when you were talking about the chance that a terrorist threat might be 1 percent real, that you had to take an action because you couldn't afford the chance it was real.</p><p end="5413" is_meta="false" speaker="Mickey Edwards" start="5339">Believe me, the environmental threat today is more than 1 percent possible. And I think it's an obligation of the Republican Party, of conservatives, to recognize that if you're going to fight against things that might do harm, might do danger, you know, that one of the things you have to look at is what's happening in the environment and what you need to do to secure our safety in that regard, too.</p><p end="5413" is_meta="false" speaker="Mickey Edwards" start="5339">Well, I don't -- I mean, should I quote Senator Inhofe that -- I don't want to say deniers,</p><p end="5413" is_meta="false" speaker="Mickey Edwards" start="5339">but they're deniers.</p><p end="5413" is_meta="true" speaker="Mickey Edwards" start="5339">laughter</p><p end="5413" is_meta="false" speaker="Ralph Reed" start="5339">Look, the Republican Party takes the position that the science on climate change is not sufficiently settled. Let me -- let me --</p><p end="5413" is_meta="false" speaker="Laura Ingraham" start="5339">That's an easy way to get a "boo" in this audience, Ralph.</p><p end="5413" is_meta="false" speaker="Ralph Reed" start="5339">Let me finish the sentence.</p><p end="5413" is_meta="false" speaker="Ralph Reed" start="5339">It&#8217;s not sufficiently --</p><p end="5413" is_meta="false" speaker="Laura Ingraham" start="5339">I'm very hot.</p><p end="5413" is_meta="false" speaker="Ralph Reed" start="5339">-- settled to justify a federally run cap in tax, cap and trade system which has been an unmitigated disaster in the Eurozone.</p><p end="5474" is_meta="false" speaker="Ralph Reed" start="5413">You should know that the Eurozone has adopted what this administration has proposed;</p><p end="5474" is_meta="false" speaker="Ralph Reed" start="5413">a cap and trade system where you have permits that trade carbon emissions back and forth across industries and factories and even across country lines. What are their CO2,</p><p end="5474" is_meta="false" speaker="Ralph Reed" start="5413">emissions up roughly over the last two years? 4 percent. We don't have a cap and trade system. Our carbon emissions have fallen by about 1 percent per year without it.</p><p end="5474" is_meta="false" speaker="Ralph Reed" start="5413">You know why? Because we've incentivized corporations to adopt cleaner technology without going to that system. So we clearly oppose a cap in tax system which one study would show, through higher utility bills, higher gasoline, and higher built-in energy prices for everything from keeping your home warm to running a factory or a manufacturing establishment, will be a $1,800 tax on every family of four in America.</p><p end="5520" is_meta="false" speaker="Ralph Reed" start="5474">We're not for that.</p><p end="5520" is_meta="false" speaker="Ralph Reed" start="5474">And by the way, neither are a lot of Democrats.</p><p end="5520" is_meta="false" speaker="Ralph Reed" start="5474">Yeah, I -- look.</p><p end="5584" is_meta="false" speaker="Ralph Reed" start="5520">Well, let me put it to you this way: If Ronald Reagan got the same share of vote among every voter group that he got in '80s, in the 2012 electorate, he would have lost. The electorate in '80 was 88 percent white. Today it's 73 percent white. I think we've already stipulated that we need to do better among minority voters, younger voters,</p><p end="5584" is_meta="false" speaker="Ralph Reed" start="5520">single voters. We can do that with conservative policies. That's the disagreement. We all agree we need to do better among minority voters. You can do it by talking about conservative policies.</p><p end="5584" is_meta="false" speaker="David Brooks" start="5520">I'll go. Ralph -- I think Ralph or Laura, I can't remember which, mentioned how the Republican party has collapsed in California. And apparently it was because of the mushy moderate policies of Pete Wilson and others. What I don't remember is Pete Wilson proposing a restrictionist immigration reform and destroying the Republican Party&#8217;s chances among Latino voters in California. And that's what destroyed theRepublican Party in California. I sit here this week, and I watch the Republican Party learning from the lesson of California and trying to do the same thing nationally.</p><p end="5704" is_meta="false" speaker="David Brooks" start="5584">And I think that's about to happen to --</p><p end="5704" is_meta="false" speaker="Laura Ingraham" start="5584">We're going back to Pete Wilson.</p><p end="5704" is_meta="false" speaker="Ralph Reed" start="5584">Well, I want you to remember when you vote tonight, that we're not voting on whether or not Republicans ought to compromise more, whether or not they ought to work with members of the other party to find common sense solutions. That's not what we're debating. We're debating whether or not the Republican Party philosophically should move from where it is to a point equidistant the two parties. And if it does not do so, it will die. Now, we have lots of data to demonstrate that that's not true. I've mentioned some of it tonight. Look at the exit polls in 2012. People asked whether or not they thought government was too big and was doing too much or whether or not they thought was government was too small and was doing too little. And a majority of Americans said government was too big and was doing too much. 41 percent of the electorate was conservative, only 23 percent liberal. I mentioned earlier that a plurality of Hispanics are conservatives. Only 23 percent of Hispanics are self-identified liberals.</p><p end="5704" is_meta="false" speaker="Ralph Reed" start="5584">Now, the Republican Party may need to talk about these issues more effectively. You know, I think about what Oscar Wilde said. You know, sometimes you can tell somebody they're going to hell in such a way that they want to get there as rapidly as possible.</p><p end="5704" is_meta="true" speaker="Ralph Reed" start="5584">laughter</p><p end="5762" is_meta="false" speaker="Ralph Reed" start="5704">And sometimes the Republicans have done that. But we're not talking here tonight about better candidates, better candidate performance. The gentleman who asked the question about engaging and connecting with minority communities, you can do all those things and remain an authentic, genuine, Reagan-style conservative. And if the Republican Party doesn't do that, if it moves to the mushy middle, if it tries to trim its ideological sails and tries to be simply a Democrat-lite, then the tens of millions of people who lick the envelopes, and knock on the doors, and make the phone calls, the volunteers who turn out on the -- on these primaries -- they will walk away from this party because it walked away from them.</p><p end="5762" is_meta="false" speaker="Ralph Reed" start="5704">Vote against this resolution.</p><p end="5824" is_meta="false" speaker="David Brooks" start="5762">We've had a lot of politics and some references to the dictionary tonight. Ralph has his [unintelligible]. Laura has her animus to George Bush. I want to go back to the little girl I mentioned. I want to go back to the high-tech entrepreneurs looking for a worker. I want to go back to the young person saddled with debt, the gay or lesbian person in a relationship who wants to solidify that relationship within the covenant of marriage.</p><p end="5824" is_meta="false" speaker="David Brooks" start="5762">The party that doesn't serve the people is going to die. The party that doesn't serve the contemporary problems of the age is going to die. Those are some of the people who have to be served by a party in order for it to survive. I'm a conservative. I have some doubts. I have a lot of skepticism about government. But you have to use government in limited and energetic ways to serve those people that I've mentioned. You have to be willing to compromise to get a budget deal so the young person is not saddled with millions of dollars of debt.</p><p end="5881" is_meta="false" speaker="David Brooks" start="5824">You have to be able to work for a comprehensive immigration reform so that the high-</p><p end="5881" is_meta="false" speaker="David Brooks" start="5824">tech worker can get a job, so the young people living in the shadows have some chance of dignity in their lives. You have to be willing to use government in limited but energetic ways to re-weave the social fabric so the young girl living a few miles from here can grow up in a neighborhood that's orderly, so that people can have jobs with earnable wages, so that people have an incentive to marry, some of them men who are now drifting through society. And that takes more government than I would have thought 10 years ago. But that is the problem that's out there. And that's the problem we have to deal with. So, I may have moved more toward the center since I worked at the Wall Street Journal editorial page or the National Review. But I think I've done it because the problems have changed. And some of those problems demand a little more government action. And if you're stuck, unwilling to use government in any of those problems, then your party will die.</p><p end="5958" is_meta="false" speaker="Laura Ingraham" start="5881">This proposition I hope you will reject, because I'm going to buy you all after margaritas afterward if you vote with me. And it's the top shelf stuff, not the stuff they were --</p><p end="5958" is_meta="true" speaker="Laura Ingraham" start="5881">laughter</p><p end="5958" is_meta="false" speaker="Laura Ingraham" start="5881">I want to start by saying -- you're not going to believe I'm saying this. But I'm going to say you should reject this proposition that the Republican Party should seize the center or die because I have a lot of faith and respect in the decision-making that Barack Obama made when he could have gone that way. He could have, himself, seized the center. He could have seized it in 1985 when it looked like liberalism was on the run.</p><p end="5958" is_meta="false" speaker="Laura Ingraham" start="5881">He could have seized in 1994, when this Newt Gingrich guy just took the country by storm, love him or hate him, but changed the face of politics. He could have given up hope in 2001 and 2002 when the whole country was rallying toward this war in Iraq, and he decided, "You know something? It's -- in my view, it's the wrong thing to do.</p><p end="5958" is_meta="false" speaker="Laura Ingraham" start="5881">Because the establishment and everyone around him was probably telling him, "The center has moved. You've got to go that way."</p><p end="6058" is_meta="false" speaker="Laura Ingraham" start="5958">He didn't go that way. He had a certain set of principles. I disagree with him deeply, but he had a certain sense of himself and sense of principles that he decided to follow, and he followed in a new way by reaching out to all those disaffected Democrats who were kind of tired of the old way and Republicans who were kind of sick of where the Republicans were falling down. And, lo and behold, Barack Obama, by not seizing the center, unseated the establishment candidate of, of course, Hillary Clinton, decided,</p><p end="6058" is_meta="false" speaker="Laura Ingraham" start="5958">"Guess what? Liberalism is back. I never let it go. I never moved to the center, and I'm going to bring along constituency after constituency in looking at the world and the country in a new way." He found his center. Republicans, guess what? They know where they -- what they believe and how they believe it. Seizing the new center is political death. Please reject the proposition.</p><p end="6058" is_meta="false" speaker="Mickey Edwards" start="5958">I should support the other side so that Laura will buy the margaritas.</p><p end="6058" is_meta="true" speaker="Mickey Edwards" start="5958">laughter</p><p end="6058" is_meta="false" speaker="Mickey Edwards" start="5958">Look, there's just one simple question on the table. It's not whether Ralph and Laura are good people, which they are, who believe strongly in their positions or whether those positions are defensible. I'm a conservative, too. I agree with a lot of the positions they've taken. But it's whether or not they are positions that can gain in total the support of a very diverse nation.</p><p end="6125" is_meta="false" speaker="Mickey Edwards" start="6058">The Republican Party we have today could disappear and be replaced by a range of its little subsets, all these other -- a Christian right party, a libertarian party, a no government, no tax party, a gun owner's party, a no gays and no immigrants party, each one with its own small niche of true believers, but America would no longer be a single nation of people standing together, and for the purposes of this discussion, then you will have lost. The Republican Party that once served as a viable noble alternative, a serious part of the national conversation will be, like the Federalists, the Whigs, and the know-nothings, irrelevant and disappeared. That is not an end that we should embrace,but as long as the Republican Party remains a coalition of extremes outside the broad range of reasonable discourse, that's precisely what will happen. We political people are kind of self-referential; we like to think of ourselves as thinking it's all about us, but it's not about us alone.</p><p end="6242" is_meta="false" speaker="Mickey Edwards" start="6125">It's not about just what we think. This is a big diverse nation, and a political party that gets smaller and narrower as the country gets larger and broader is a party that is doomed.</p></transcript></debate>
