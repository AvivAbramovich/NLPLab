They call me up usually to tell me they saw me --you know, cheer me on for brawling with Bill O'Reilly . And they always claim that they accidentally saw Fox News when they were flipping through the channels.</p><p end="420" is_meta="true" speaker="Kirsten Powers" start="359">laughter</p><p end="420" is_meta="false" speaker="Angus Johnston" start="359">Actually, I was sitting quietly in a stude nt lounge discussing blood donation policy.</p><p end="483" is_meta="false" speaker="Angus Johnston" start="420">The incredibly erudite Jeremy Mayer.</p><p end="483" is_meta="false" speaker="Jeremy Mayer" start="420">Hey, it makes me feel pretty good . A college professor shou ld not tell you what to think .</p><p end="483" is_meta="false" speaker="Jeremy Mayer" start="420">He should give you -- he or she should give you the tools to think for yourself.</p><p end="608" is_meta="false" speaker="Greg Lukianoff" start="549">Let me start by whisking you back to a magical time -- 2001. A conservative would have dismissed me as a liberal clich&#233; . I was a floppy-haired, Burning Man regular, San Francisc -ite who turned down big law salaries to work for social justice .</p><p end="658" is_meta="false" speaker="Greg Lukianoff" start="608">I had worked in refugee camps in Eastern Europe, for an environmental justice mentoring program in D.C., and for the ACLU of Northern California. And most of all, I loved the First Amendment, the quintessential liberal cause -- or so I thought. 2001 was also the year I started working at FIRE, which proudly defends speech and academic</p><p end="658" is_meta="false" speaker="Greg Lukianoff" start="608">freedom for speakers of any political stripe . As soon as I started at FIRE, however, I was inundated with hundreds of pleas for help. It wasn't long before I learned this unfortunate truth : if you're going to be censored on the modern college campus for your opinion, chances ar e you're going to be censored by the Left. And this is what we mean by the Left, and most Americans mean when we say "Liberal" these days, either people on the left side of the political spectrum or people who self- identify as liberals,</p><p end="658" is_meta="false" speaker="Greg Lukianoff" start="608">and people to thei r left. I have been -- I have seen so many crazy examples of politically -</p><p end="658" is_meta="false" speaker="Greg Lukianoff" start="608">correct censorship.</p><p end="724" is_meta="false" speaker="Greg Lukianoff" start="658">A student at Indiana punished just for publicly reading a book, a sorority sister forced to publicly repent for insensitivity for a Taco Tuesday event, and Yale students banned from calling Harvard students "sissies" on a t -shirt, which was a quote from F. Scott Fitzgerald by the way . This is heartbreaking to me and my teammate, since both of us consider ourselves liberals . Of course there are many, q uote, good liberals out there who still support free speech, both on and off campus . These include former ACLU President Nadine Strossen, The Nation's Michelle Goldberg, renowned First Amendment attorney Floyd Abrams, and many more . But one thing all of these liberals have in common is that they also believe that the campus liberals have become distressingly intolerant of dissent. Take any hot topic in America today and I can point you to examples of students and faculty members getting in trouble for being on the conservative side of the issue . Take abortion. While FIRE has proudly supported the free speech rights of pro -choice students, we are far more likely to have to come to the defense of pro -life students . How bad is it ? At Northern Kentucky University, a professor actually led her students to destroy a pro -life display .</p><p end="782" is_meta="false" speaker="Greg Lukianoff" start="724">The display was only dozens of little white crosses to protest Roe V . Wade. At Dartmouth, a similar pro -life display -- this time involving tiny American flags , was considered so offensive that another student ran it over with his car . That reckless censor -- have you any guess about what his politics were ? He had a COEXIST sticker on the back of his car .</p><p end="966" is_meta="false" speaker="Jeremy Mayer" start="906">Thank you. The picture that Greg drew is a common one . It is the conservative picture of the modern university . Perhaps best summarized by former Pennsylvania senator Rick Santorum who called universities "indoctrination mills." In this picture, we are --</p><p end="966" is_meta="false" speaker="Jeremy Mayer" start="906">higher education is infused with an overly liberal professoriate, biased classrooms and stifled campus debate.</p><p end="1028" is_meta="false" speaker="Jeremy Mayer" start="966">If this picture is true, it is indeed very serious . If it is an accurate portrait of higher education in America, then we should all be alarmed, and we should all donate money to Greg's group . Is it, though? I will handle those first two, are professors liberal? And why ? Is the classroom a biased place ? And mostly leave the third to Angus . So, are professors liberal? Well, yes. When we did the research, a national random sample survey for our book, we found that 61 percent of college professors are left or liberal.</p><p end="1324" is_meta="false" speaker="Jeremy Mayer" start="1267">Yep.</p><p end="1324" is_meta="false" speaker="Jeremy Mayer" start="1267">Thank you.</p><p end="1324" is_meta="true" speaker="Jeremy Mayer" start="1267">a pplause</p><p end="1386" is_meta="false" speaker="Kirsten Powers" start="1324">Thank you. Thanks to Intelligence Squared for doing a debate on such an important topic . And I'm always happy t o be anywhere where Bill O'Reilly can't interrupt me, so I'm happy to be here . Our opponents are telling you that liberals are not stifling intellectual diversity on campuses . Sadly, this could not be further from the truth. A perfect example of this is a 2013 case that happened at the University of Alaska,</p><p end="1386" is_meta="false" speaker="Kirsten Powers" start="1324">Fairbanks, where I'm from. My parents were professors there . A feminist professor filed multiple sexual harassment complaints against the student university -- the campus university there -- because of an April Fool&#8217;s Day issue of an article that was mildly mocking feminism. The professor filed another complaint after the newspaper published an article that was critical of hate speech.</p><p end="1439" is_meta="false" speaker="Kirsten Powers" start="1386">The university's repeated investigations dragged on for almost nine months and -- and it only really ended when FIRE had intervened an d informed them they were violating the First Amendment . Ironically, the editor- in-chief, who wrote this article, was herself a feminist and thought she was doing a very mild , mocking , April Fool&#8217;s Day story . And she told F IRE that the chilling investigation that was launched by the University of Alaska prevented her from publishing stories on important issues, including sexual assault .</p><p end="1439" is_meta="false" speaker="Kirsten Powers" start="1386">Recently, at Milwaukee's Marquette University, a political science professor t here, John McAdams, blogged about an exchange where a Marquette philosophy professor had told a student that debating gay marriage in class was, quote, "not appropriate and homophobic."</p><p end="1504" is_meta="false" speaker="Kirsten Powers" start="1439">For this, Marquette suspended the professor, McAdams , who blogged about it, banned him from campus, and they are now in the process of trying to revoke his tenure . Greg and I both support gay marriage, but this is an extremely chilling way for Marquette to handle this issue . As Jeremy acknowledged, the decks are stacked against those who express non -liberal views on campuses . And I would just point out, to the point that campuses have always been liberal, liberals are very -- liberals -- the liberals in the past actually supported free speech, and I think that would be the big difference of today, is that the liberals that we're talking about today are enacting very hostile policies against free speech . And so there's a big difference . They may be voting for the same people,</p><p end="1504" is_meta="false" speaker="Kirsten Powers" start="1439">but they are behaving in a very different way . And many studies will back up the fact that there are vastly more liberals on campuses . There was one study that found that 72 percent of college professors identify as liberal , while only 15 percent identify as conservative .</p><p end="1559" is_meta="false" speaker="Kirsten Powers" start="1504">It's gotten so bad that several prominent social psychologists have written an article recently arguing that the field of psychology is being badly hurt by the lack of political diversity . One of the papers -- and, by the way, none of them are conservatives who wrote this -- one of the paper's authors is NYU Professor Jonathan Haidt. At a 2011 social psychologist symposium, he asked the audience to show hands for their political leanings . Out of a thousand people only three rai sed their hands to say that they were conservative . And Haidt points out that, of course, there were more conservatives in the audience -- that can't be the actual ratio -- but they were too afraid to identify themselves, which speaks for itself. He expl ained that this gross political and ideological disparity is evidence of a, quote, "tribal moral community that actively discourages conservatives from entering."</p><p end="1624" is_meta="false" speaker="Kirsten Powers" start="1559">He explained that there were -- in preparing for his speech, he wanted to talk to some non -liberal graduate students . He was able to only identify two in the -- of social psychology graduate students, and that he said that he -- they reminded him of closeted gays from the 1980s . And he referred to them as "closeted conservatives" because they were -- they felt that they were forced to hide their identities and -- from their colleagues and from their professors, and it really affected the research that they did .</p><p end="1624" is_meta="false" speaker="Kirsten Powers" start="1559">And so Haidt argued that more ideological diversity would lead to, quo te, "better science and freer thinking." The ideological slant, it's not just a passive preference .</p><p end="1624" is_meta="false" speaker="Kirsten Powers" start="1559">During the 2012 election, 96 percent, which is almost 100 percent as we all know, of political contributions from Ivy League faculty and staff went to the Obama campaign .</p><p end="1624" is_meta="false" speaker="Kirsten Powers" start="1559">And during the 2004 election, professors donated $19 to John Kerry's campaign for every dollar that went to George Bush.</p><p end="1681" is_meta="false" speaker="Kirsten Powers" start="1624">And as sociologist Neil Gross has pointed out, o ur colleges and our universities are one -</p><p end="1681" is_meta="false" speaker="Kirsten Powers" start="1624">party campuses. Last year at the University of California at Santa Barbara, one of the worst cases probably that we'll talk about tonight, a feminist professor's study -- she was found guilty of grand theft, vandali sm, and battery after a physical altercation in which she stole and destroyed a 16 -year -old pro -life demonstrator's sign . The professor claimed she was triggered by the poster's graphic images, called the demonstrators</p><p end="1681" is_meta="false" speaker="Kirsten Powers" start="1624">"terrorists," and told police she had a moral right to her behavior and was just setting a good example . She still has a job and was basically defended by scores of professors.</p><p end="1681" is_meta="false" speaker="Kirsten Powers" start="1624">We've also seen discrimination against Christian groups on campuses &#8211; it&#8217;s getting much worse at Vanderbilt . Fourteen campus groups lost their organizational status in 2012 because they wanted to choose their own leaders based on religious belief.</p><p end="1746" is_meta="false" speaker="Kirsten Powers" start="1681">A nd there are just many more campus fellowship groups from University of -- State University of New York or the Cal State system who've lost -- have been driven off campus . And, you know, Harvard Professor and former Obama administration appointee Cass Sunstein has warned that when a group becomes ideologically homogenous, it tends to drift farther and farther in that direction and become more hostile to outsiders.</p><p end="1746" is_meta="false" speaker="Kirsten Powers" start="1681">But it's reason [inaudible].</p><p end="1746" is_meta="false" speaker="Kirsten Powers" start="1681">Yep.</p><p end="1746" is_meta="false" speaker="Angus Johnston" start="1681">Thank you. My adversaries have made some really cogent points this evening, and so as an actual campus Leftist, I look forward to denouncing them as bigots .</p><p end="1746" is_meta="true" speaker="Angus Johnston" start="1681">laughter</p><p end="1746" is_meta="false" speaker="Angus Johnston" start="1681">But before I do that, I'd like to take a step back and talk a little bit about the campus .</p><p end="1811" is_meta="false" speaker="Angus Johnston" start="1746">What the actual, average American campus is like today . The American campus today,</p><p end="1811" is_meta="false" speaker="Angus Johnston" start="1746">as it has been in the past, is a site of robust and passionate debate . And that's true not only because it's a place of learning, but also because it is a haven for young people .</p><p end="1811" is_meta="false" speaker="Angus Johnston" start="1746">And the reality is that most of us, a t some point in our lives, give up on debating people we profoundly disagree with . We decide that it's too hard, it's too uncomfortable, it doesn't usually work. And so, we give up . But college students haven't given up yet.</p><p end="1811" is_meta="false" speaker="Angus Johnston" start="1746">And so, they argue, incessantly and angrily . But here's the thing. In my experience, on campuses across the country -- and this is backed up by my opponent's o wn data --</p><p end="1811" is_meta="false" speaker="Angus Johnston" start="1746">where free speech is curtailed on campus, it's overwhelmingly not by students or campus liberals, but by administrators who are motivated not by ideology, but by opposition to disruptiveness and clamor.</p><p end="1862" is_meta="false" speaker="Angus Johnston" start="1811">A perfect example of this is a case that many critics of campus leftism and campus liberalism have talked abo ut -- the case of Robert Birgeneau , the former chancellor of the University of California Berkeley, who, as Berkeley chancellor, presided over the arrests of dozens of peaceful, non- violent student protestors on multiple occasions,</p><p end="1862" is_meta="false" speaker="Angus Johnston" start="1811">including one occasion in 2011, where students who were demonstrating peacefully were beaten viciously by campus police with batons . After he stepped down as Berkeley's chancellor, Birgeneau was invited to give a commencement address at Haverford College in Pennsylvania. And some Haverford students were understandably not so happy about this . So, what did they do ? Did they burn down the building ? Did they lock him out?</p><p end="1920" is_meta="false" speaker="Angus Johnston" start="1862">Did they beat him with batons ? No . They did none of those things . What they did is write a letter. They wrote a long letter expressing their concerns in which they offered</p><p end="1920" is_meta="false" speaker="Angus Johnston" start="1862">suggestions for how he could repair the harm that he had done to civil liberties at Berkley . And they urged -- that was their word -- "urged" him -- to -- as they put it,</p><p end="1920" is_meta="false" speaker="Angus Johnston" start="1862">"confront the issues be fore you." If he didn't do that, they said, they would ask the college to withdraw his invitation, a request that they had no power to enfor ce. In a two -line reply, Birgeneau said that he would not respond to what he called their &#8220;violent verbal attacks. " Period . He wouldn't meet with them . He wouldn't respond to the claims that they had made . He wouldn't debate them . And in fact, he wouldn't even come to their campus . He withdrew his decision to come and speak at their commencement.</p><p end="1981" is_meta="false" speaker="Angus Johnston" start="1920">Now, FIRE has written about this incident many times . Op-ed writers all over the country have written about this incident. And every time they do, Birgeneau -- an administrator who presided over the beating and arrest of student protestors -- isportraye d as a free speech martyr. Well, the students who had just wanted to talk to him about that -- are portrayed as his oppressors . And I say that that is absolutely wrong . I say that is absolutely backwards . Now, I'm not asking you to embrace every argume nt made by every member of the campus Left, because frankly, some of their arguments are really bad arguments . But speech that nobody opposes is not speech that needs protecting . And there's a recurring tactic that we see in critics of the campus Left in which students who are engaging in free speech are condemned as violent or condemned as censors .</p><p end="2039" is_meta="false" speaker="Angus Johnston" start="1981">And you know, hyperbole is free speech, whether it's the hyperbole of students calling a speaker who said something unfortunate a racist or the hyperbole of an administrator calling a polite letter a violent attack . Demonizing your opponents is free speech . But so is refusing to demonize them . And that's what I'm asking you to do today . I want you to vote against this motion, because it's not liberals who are stifling free speech on the American campus, but bureaucrats . Bureaucrats who are scared by the rowdy, messy vitality of the marketplace of ideals -- ideas . So, what I'm asking you to do here is to stand up for free speech on campus -- the freedom of speech of the Left and the Right and the Center by voting against this ill -conceived and prejudicial motion . And I'd just like to close by saying one thing .</p><p end="2106" is_meta="false" speaker="Angus Johnston" start="2039">A few days ago we lost a champion of speech and debate and dialogue in this country,</p><p end="2106" is_meta="false" speaker="Angus Johnston" start="2039">David Carr, who wrote for the New York Times. And on the stage at the Intelligence Squared debate s a couple years ago, he said something that I would just like to quote to you now . He said, "I urge you to vote against, against, against this motion which is per se dumb." Thank you.</p><p end="2290" is_meta="false" speaker="Angus Johnston" start="2219">Yeah . I think there are a few things that need to be said in response to that. First is, the folks who draw up these speech codes are not intending to impose ideological conformity.</p><p end="2290" is_meta="false" speaker="Angus Johnston" start="2219">Oh, yeah, sorry.</p><p end="2290" is_meta="false" speaker="Angus Johnston" start="2219">I will do that . That's right, you are -- you are my actual audience as well as "the"</p><p end="2290" is_meta="false" speaker="Angus Johnston" start="2219">audience . So, okay, so the folks who have drawn up these speech codes are for the most part not intending to impose ideological conformity .</p><p end="2348" is_meta="false" speaker="Angus Johnston" start="2290">They are trying to keep trustees happy, they are trying to keep alumni happy . They are trying to avoid having parents feel like their kids who they think of as still children are living in a den of iniquity . And so there is certainly a tremendous amount of pressure from the top to keep things calm on the campus . But that's a very different thing than an attempt to impose ideological conformity . And in fact, in the 2015 speech code report that Fire just produced, they cite that the setting aside speech c odes which are not currently being enforced, they cite 15 examples of freedom of speech violations and 12 of those are nonideological, things like people getting -- students getti ng written up for passing out constitutions on campus .</p><p end="2401" is_meta="false" speaker="Angus Johnston" start="2348">That's not anti - conservative.</p><p end="2401" is_meta="false" speaker="Greg Lukianoff" start="2348">I'll -- I think I can start with that.</p><p end="2401" is_meta="false" speaker="Greg Lukianoff" start="2348">I mean, it was interesting to have your own research sort of cited, because when we watch how these codes are written, you know, as I said, they came from liberal thinkers,</p><p end="2401" is_meta="false" speaker="Greg Lukianoff" start="2348">they came from the C atherine MacKinnons. They are used disproportionally against conservative points of view consistently . And the idea that, yes, absolutely,</p><p end="2401" is_meta="false" speaker="Greg Lukianoff" start="2348">administrators are largely the big problem, and they have been, and I'd be willing to say that. But the administrators themselves lean overwhelmingly left . It's 96 percent donations to the Obama campaign came from --when you take staff and faculty together . So, they're using the same tools . And just -- and I really have to say, the -- I have seen genuinely heartbreaking case of things that you should never do to people coming from administrators that are very much left.</p><p end="2464" is_meta="false" speaker="Greg Lukianoff" start="2401">There was the University of Wisconsin case where they were telling a student he couldn't have a Bible study meeting in his own room on his own time because people knew he wa s an Evangelical Christian . They might find that offensive . Again, I'm an atheist, but that's wrong.</p><p end="2464" is_meta="false" speaker="Angus Johnston" start="2401">Okay . Well, I thin k one of the things that we need to look at here is what are the circumstances in which students who are not conservatives, who are being caught up in these . And I think honestly, I think, yes, you can say that they were probably liberal in their political views, but they were centrist in their views about what is appropriate discussion and debate on campus .</p><p end="2525" is_meta="false" speaker="Angus Johnston" start="2464">And here's an example of it . There was a case recently where two students who were joking around with each other and one of them was whi te, and one of them was black,</p><p end="2525" is_meta="false" speaker="Angus Johnston" start="2464">and one of them -- the white said to the black one, "Can I get a white power?" And this was a joke that they had between themselves . And neither one of them was offended by it . And they were both brought up on charges beca use the kind of humor that they were engaging was found offensive by the administration. Now, is that suppression of conservative speech ? Is it suppression of liberal speech ? No . It's just a jerk administrator being a jerk.</p><p end="2525" is_meta="false" speaker="Kirsten Powers" start="2464">Yeah.</p><p end="2525" is_meta="false" speaker="Kirsten Powers" start="2464">The point isn't that it's always conservatives . I don't -- that's not actually our position .</p><p end="2525" is_meta="false" speaker="Kirsten Powers" start="2464">The position is that it has overwhelmingly been used against conservatives, but liberals absolutely are affected by it as well, and that's a good example of it by liberals . And,</p><p end="2525" is_meta="false" speaker="Kirsten Powers" start="2464">you know, what we're talking about is liberals stifling intellectual diversity . And that kind of behavior is extre mely chilling.</p><p end="2584" is_meta="false" speaker="Kirsten Powers" start="2525">So, if you're those students that you just described, and you're on a campus where you think you're going to get in trouble for a private conversation which we have a lot of --</p><p end="2584" is_meta="false" speaker="Kirsten Powers" start="2525">you know the stories too . There are a lot of storie s like this. You are going to be very careful about what you say . And that is going to stifle intellectual diversity if people feel like I can't say something . At Marquette University, there was another case where -- in their training of the professors, they had a slide that said to the professors -- it was an example of something that they might have to respond to . Two students are talking .</p><p end="2584" is_meta="false" speaker="Kirsten Powers" start="2525">They oppose same -sex marriage . They're talking about how they oppose same -sex marriage . A third student overhe ars them and reports them to the administration .</p><p end="2584" is_meta="false" speaker="Kirsten Powers" start="2525">They were told this was the proper handling of this incident. They're turning -- they're turning students into informants on each other for having a conversation. And what even the conversation had become very heated and even they said things that were bigoted?</p><p end="2646" is_meta="false" speaker="Kirsten Powers" start="2584">I mean, people are supposed to, on campuses, be able to debate things and say offensive things . And in that case, it's not even offensive.</p><p end="2646" is_meta="false" speaker="Jeremy Mayer" start="2584">I couldn't agree with you more . And I was meeting with some of the students who are here in the audience before this began, and they were Libertarians . And I said, "Have you been stifled on campus?" And one of them from James Madison said, "Yes, because J ames Madison has a policy that you cannot as a student group have anything about drugs or alcohol on your posters . And we wanted to have a debate about drug legalization, and we felt clamped down." Well, trust me, that is not a liberal policy . That is y our generation of young people have been wrapped in bubble wrap all your lives .</p><p end="2646" is_meta="false" speaker="Jeremy Mayer" start="2584">And when I was in college, if they'd even tried to do that, liberals, conservatives,</p><p end="2646" is_meta="false" speaker="Jeremy Mayer" start="2584">moderates and the crew team would have been out there fighting this . So, it is --</p><p end="2646" is_meta="false" speaker="Jeremy Mayer" start="2584">It is what Angus said is that it is conservative, small C, administrators who don't want trouble with donors and press, it is not liberals .</p><p end="2704" is_meta="false" speaker="Jeremy Mayer" start="2646">Liberals don't lik e bans on what can appear on student posters any more than you do.</p><p end="2704" is_meta="false" speaker="Kirsten Powers" start="2646">Are you saying administrators are conservative?</p><p end="2704" is_meta="false" speaker="Jeremy Mayer" start="2646">Am I saying administrators?</p><p end="2704" is_meta="false" speaker="Kirsten Powers" start="2646">Yes.</p><p end="2704" is_meta="false" speaker="Angus Johnston" start="2646">Okay, but -- okay, so --</p><p end="2704" is_meta="false" speaker="Angus Johnston" start="2646">-- thank you. So, I think that --</p><p end="2704" is_meta="true" speaker="Angus Johnston" start="2646">laughter</p><p end="2704" is_meta="false" speaker="Angus Johnston" start="2646">-- oh, so the -- right.</p><p end="2704" is_meta="false" speaker="Angus Johnston" start="2646">Oh.</p><p end="2704" is_meta="false" speaker="Angus Johnston" start="2646">Where was I?</p><p end="2704" is_meta="true" speaker="Angus Johnston" start="2646">laughter</p><p end="2704" is_meta="false" speaker="Angus Johnston" start="2646">Are most administrators liberal? Absolutely. Are most -- is most of the suppression of speech that oc curs on campuses directed at conservatives ? Absolutely not. The majority of the suppression of speech that occurs on campuses is non- ideological.</p><p end="2764" is_meta="false" speaker="Angus Johnston" start="2704">It is not directed at conservatives or liberals . And I'd also like to take this conversation a slightly different direction, if I may, and say the most -- the most chilling examples of suppression of free expression occur when students are beaten and when they are arrested for engaging in free speech . And the students who are on the receiving end of that are overwhelmingly liberal and left students.</p><p end="2764" is_meta="false" speaker="Greg Lukianoff" start="2704">And --</p><p end="2764" is_meta="false" speaker="Greg Lukianoff" start="2704">-- there's something really important that I want to say, is that we're talking about how,</p><p end="2764" is_meta="false" speaker="Greg Lukianoff" start="2704">you know, Jeremy was talking about the consistency of liberals . And the kind of liberal that I grew up with and was one that adamantly believed in freedom of speech. And Ang us is good on freedom of speech, and we have a lot of cases on which we agree, but if the administration -- which overwhelmingly leans left -- if modern liberals were as good on free speech as the old '60s and '70s liberals were, as me and Angus are on the se issues, these administrative overreach things, as I said in my s tatement, would be impossible . Sometimes it's active, sometimes it's just complicit, but it's allowing the stifling of intellectual diversity.</p><p end="2824" is_meta="false" speaker="Jeremy Mayer" start="2764">But you don't ever c omplain about the real stifling of intellectual diversity, which happens at hundreds of campuses across this country that are conservative, and explicitly --</p><p end="2824" is_meta="false" speaker="Greg Lukianoff" start="2764">Oh, yes, we do.</p><p end="2824" is_meta="false" speaker="Jeremy Mayer" start="2764">-- no, I've read -- you have this whole statement on your website that says, "We will not take on Liberty University, and stop asking us to --</p><p end="2824" is_meta="false" speaker="Greg Lukianoff" start="2764">Oh, Liberty, yeah.</p><p end="2824" is_meta="false" speaker="Greg Lukianoff" start="2764">Jeremy Mayer:-- because they are open about their stifling, so it's okay.</p><p end="2824" is_meta="false" speaker="Greg Lukianoff" start="2764">Yeah, so --</p><p end="2824" is_meta="false" speaker="Jeremy Mayer" start="2764">I'm sor ry. If you care about free speech, care about the kids at Liberty, care about the kids at Catholic, care about the kids at BYU, care about the BYU professor who was fired for saying he was in favor of gay marriage.</p><p end="2824" is_meta="false" speaker="Greg Lukianoff" start="2764">-- we have taken on religious university after religious university, but I like how people kind of play dumb on this particular issue, where it's kin d of -- Liberty University makes you sign a contract saying you essentially give up all your rights at the door. What are we s upposed to argue, that you don't know -- or that you don't know that you're going to BYU and suddenly you're like, "Oh, my God, it's Mormon . It's super Mormon."</p><p end="2824" is_meta="true" speaker="Greg Lukianoff" start="2764">laughter</p><p end="2824" is_meta="false" speaker="Greg Lukianoff" start="2764">You have the right to give up some free -- to agree to that .</p><p end="2883" is_meta="false" speaker="Greg Lukianoff" start="2824">I would never attend any of these schools . But I want to point out we take on religious schools all the time and for that matter we're coming out with a list of worst schools for freedom of speech. One of the schools that we're going to be listing -- and I'll -- and you'll have to wait to see why -- is Georgetown University, a Catholic university in D.C .</p><p end="2883" is_meta="false" speaker="Greg Lukianoff" start="2824">Wait a week to see the article, but, yes, we take on religious schools all the time . But,</p><p end="2883" is_meta="false" speaker="Greg Lukianoff" start="2824">yes, if you tell people, you give up your rights on the door and you agree to that, then you have the right to do that. Meanwhile, at Yale and Harvard and Princeton, the big schools that people would mean when they're talking about higher education, they all promise free speech to high heaven, and they should be held to those promises.</p><p end="2883" is_meta="false" speaker="Jeremy Mayer" start="2824">But when Harvard had a civility --</p><p end="2883" is_meta="true" speaker="Jeremy Mayer" start="2824">applause</p><p end="2883" is_meta="false" speaker="Greg Lukianoff" start="2824">Basically what we said is if they want to go to their donors and go to their students and say, "Sorry, you know those glowing promises of free speech that we make ? Eh, we don 't really mean them. We're going with the civility idea," they are actually free to do that.</p><p end="2941" is_meta="false" speaker="Greg Lukianoff" start="2883">And I -- and, you know, it'd be interesting to watch them try it, but they would start losing those professors and those donors in a heartbeat. But they absolutely are free to do that.</p><p end="2941" is_meta="false" speaker="Jeremy Mayer" start="2883">But they weren't keeping it a secret.</p><p end="2941" is_meta="false" speaker="Angus Johnston" start="2883">Well, I think that -- I absolutely respect the position that you all take on this issue of saying that these conservative campuses are in another category, these particular ones are in another category, and as a matter of law and as a matter of their legal right to repress free speech, yes, they have the right under the Constitution of the Unite d States, but I think it's also important to note that they are repressing free speech. And it's also really important to note that, no, you don't go, "Oh, my God, BYU is really, really Mormon," when you arrive, but you might go, "Oh, my God, I'm gay." A nd so the repression that students are facing in these campuses is real, and I think you and I agree on that. I think that the disagreement is you don't think that that's something for FIRE to take on. I suspect that personally you find it as repugnant a s I do.</p><p end="3002" is_meta="false" speaker="Kirsten Powers" start="2941">No . And no -- there is no role for speech codes . And I think especially on a campus . A campus is -- we hear a lot about how campuses are now supposed to be these safe spaces . They should be physically safe . But they should be places that you go and you feel challenged . And you might feel angry, and you might feel upset, and you might read things and hear things that are -- that are intellectually diverse, and that yo u would actually encounter people who think differently than you. And I think that a speech code just creates an extremely chilling environment -- especially because these speech codes are so arbitrary . So, there -- it's left to the administrators to dec ide what violates the speech code . And it's -- they're too -- they're overly broad .</p><p end="3061" is_meta="false" speaker="Kirsten Powers" start="3002">A nd they are sort of disproportionately used, I think, against --</p><p end="3061" is_meta="false" speaker="Kirsten Powers" start="3002">-- people who are expressing so -called wrong views.</p><p end="3061" is_meta="false" speaker="Kirsten Powers" start="3002">Civility to a point, but I think that that is overstressed, honestly . I think that it should be robust debate in people . It should be a place where students are allowed to make mistake s, you know, to say something that is offensive.</p><p end="3061" is_meta="false" speaker="Jeremy Mayer" start="3002">I couldn't agree more.</p><p end="3122" is_meta="false" speaker="Greg Lukianoff" start="3061">Just a simple sort of basic philosophical point. John Stuart Mill, in his wonderful 1859 book "On Liberty," talks about civility . And this is why you should always be concerned about calls for civility . He points out that civility ends up getting defined by the people who are in charge . And you'll notice that when people argue for civility, they tend to actually believe that whatever they say is civil. And if they' re angry about it, it's righteous rage .</p><p end="3185" is_meta="false" speaker="Greg Lukianoff" start="3122">But if you say it and it's kind of sharp or mean, then it's incivil [spelled phonetically] .</p><p end="3185" is_meta="false" speaker="Greg Lukianoff" start="3122">And this -- this is the one of the reasons why it is a problem that you have this incredible sort of liberal d ominance on campus, is that you end up actually seeing, in some cases,</p><p end="3185" is_meta="false" speaker="Greg Lukianoff" start="3122">what your point of view is as a -- and anybody opposing as being fundamentally uncivil .</p><p end="3185" is_meta="false" speaker="Greg Lukianoff" start="3122">And sometimes, disagreement -- to be productive -- can't be all that civil.</p><p end="3250" is_meta="false" speaker="Angus Johnston" start="3185">-- made an attempt to fight.</p><p end="3250" is_meta="false" speaker="Kirsten Powers" start="3185">Yeah.</p><p end="3250" is_meta="false" speaker="Angus Johnston" start="3185">What --</p><p end="3250" is_meta="false" speaker="Angus Johnston" start="3185">No -- no -- no --</p><p end="3250" is_meta="false" speaker="Angus Johnston" start="3185">-- no it was prepared by an individual student, a recent alum. It wasn't at a formal [unintelligible].</p><p end="3306" is_meta="false" speaker="Kirsten Powers" start="3250">Yeah, I --</p><p end="3306" is_meta="true" speaker="Kirsten Powers" start="3250">l aughter</p><p end="3420" is_meta="false" speaker="Angus Johnston" start="3362">Overwhelmingly liberal students.</p><p end="3420" is_meta="false" speaker="Angus Johnston" start="3362">No -- liberal students are the victims of the --</p><p end="3420" is_meta="false" speaker="Angus Johnston" start="3362">I guess I -- well, so I thi nk the question is, if -- if the answer -- if the premise of this question is, if any time an administrator who is a liberal in their personal life is violating free speech rights of somebody else, then -- then the answer is that, yes that is a liberal,</p><p end="3420" is_meta="false" speaker="Angus Johnston" start="3362">stifling intellectual diversity on campus.</p><p end="3485" is_meta="true" speaker="Angus Johnston" start="3420">l aughter</p><p end="3485" is_meta="false" speaker="Angus Johnston" start="3420">But, any time a liberal -- any time a campus does anything, i t's usually liberals doing it.</p><p end="3485" is_meta="false" speaker="Angus Johnston" start="3420">And so the -- I think that the question of whether it is an ideological stifli ng of primarily conservatives, I think that that's the more interesting question.</p><p end="3485" is_meta="false" speaker="Kirsten Powers" start="3420">And I should like to point out in --</p><p end="3539" is_meta="false" speaker="Kirsten Powers" start="3485">No.</p><p end="3539" is_meta="false" speaker="Kirsten Powers" start="3485">Right . I think -- I me an, we haven't talked about a lot of cases where it actually doesn't have anything to do with the administr ators. It has the -- the Kaminer, that was derived completely from students . In fact, the administrator that the president of Smith was there when it happened and -- and it really wasn't that much of an incident. It was something that came from students, and students who then started protesting and demanding, you kno w, that the president of Smith condemn this and all these other things. So, I think you see it with Bill Maher, same thing .</p><p end="3603" is_meta="false" speaker="Kirsten Powers" start="3539">You know, it was a student -led revolt against him for his comments about Islam. These were, again, from the left . But it all has the same effect of making people feel that they can't -- they cannot say how they think because they don't know what kind of retribution [unintelligible].</p><p end="3603" is_meta="false" speaker="Angus Johnston" start="3539">I thi nk it's pretty clear that Wendy Kaminer is not afraid of saying what she thinks because she said it in The Washington Post again.</p><p end="3603" is_meta="false" speaker="Kirsten Powers" start="3539">[unintelligible] called a racist [unintelligible].</p><p end="3603" is_meta="false" speaker="Angus Johnston" start="3539">That's fine.</p><p end="3603" is_meta="true" speaker="Angus Johnston" start="3539">talking simultaneously</p><p end="3603" is_meta="false" speaker="Kirsten Powers" start="3539">You even mis -rep -- you've done exactly what they did. You've misrepresented what she did . She was actually trying to explain free speech to people, and she was actually arguing against censorship on campuses, and she was trying to make the point, youknow, that we actually can handle hearing certain words . Now, would I have done what she did? No, I don't think so . It was provocative . But for her to be tarred as a racist the way that she was and accused of making racist comments when you know perfectly well --</p><p end="3603" is_meta="false" speaker="Angus Johnston" start="3539">I s what?</p><p end="3603" is_meta="false" speaker="Kirsten Powers" start="3539">-- she did not say something racist . It's chilling.</p><p end="3603" is_meta="false" speaker="Kirsten Powers" start="3539">It's a mess to make people feel that they can't -- they can't criticize censorship in the way that she did.</p><p end="3662" is_meta="false" speaker="Angus Johnston" start="3603">I think that what you are left with then is saying that if something thinks that somebody is a racist, they shouldn't say so.</p><p end="3662" is_meta="false" speaker="Kirsten Powers" start="3603">No, that's not what I said.</p><p end="3662" is_meta="false" speaker="Angus Johnston" start="3603">Because -- well --</p><p end="3662" is_meta="false" speaker="Kirsten Powers" start="3603">But that's not what they did. You're saying that they said they was a racist . You know that's not what happened.</p><p end="3662" is_meta="false" speaker="Kirsten Powers" start="3603">No . What happened -- what I mean is she was tarred -- I mean, yeah, they shouldn't say she is a racist . They can say, "We don 't think she should have said that." That's not what happened.</p><p end="3662" is_meta="false" speaker="Kirsten Powers" start="3603">John Donvan:Are you saying there are certain words that are silencing in their effect. "Racist" would be one of them.</p><p end="3662" is_meta="false" speaker="Kirsten Powers" start="3603">I think the -- I think the reaction to what she did wa s -- has a silencing impact in the sense that it misrepresented in the same way I that you, frankly, misrepresented wha t she did. She was saying -- she was talking specifically about how they are trying to censor certain works of literature on campuses be cause of words that are offensive to people . And she was making t he point that this is not something we should do.</p><p end="3662" is_meta="false" speaker="Kirsten Powers" start="3603">Yeah, Huck Finn specifically . And then to have her now portray it as like the -- you know, like Bull Connor.</p><p end="3720" is_meta="false" speaker="Kirsten Powers" start="3662">You know what I mean ? It's not -- that people know what happened --</p><p end="3785" is_meta="false" speaker="Jeremy Mayer" start="3720">Sure . I think it -- I think it is a very important question as --</p><p end="3785" is_meta="false" speaker="Jeremy Mayer" start="3720">-- I understand it, it has to do with leadership roles . So, certain campuses have a rule that says, any student organization has to have an open membership and open leadership voting which produces the odd outcome that you could have a Christian group of a small group of st udents that a group of malicious 19 years old, who were really jerky atheists could join the group and take it over. And so some campus groups have said, "We'd like to have our bylaws that said the leader of the campus Christian crusade needs to be an Eva ngelical Christian," right? How do we resolve that ? I don't know, but I would not be in favor of booting Christian groups off campus .</p><p end="3846" is_meta="false" speaker="Jeremy Mayer" start="3785">I think that is a violation of free speech as well.</p><p end="3846" is_meta="false" speaker="Jeremy Mayer" start="3785">It's because the campus has an organization that -- campuses are trying to keep the student KKK group from founding . So, in order to keep white Aryan groups from forming that would not admit black students, they try to write campus rules that would make every student group open to members of all races and religions and beliefs . But when you do that, you create a problem for some Christian groups if an angry group of other believing students want to join their group [unintelligible].</p><p end="3846" is_meta="false" speaker="Greg Lukianoff" start="3785">But I want to be serious for a momen t in addressing that. Again, let's talk about Emily Brooker . She's an evangelical Christian student trying to get her degree in social work at Missouri State University.</p><p end="3902" is_meta="false" speaker="Greg Lukianoff" start="3846">She's an evangelical, and she doesn't believe in gay marriage, and she doesn't believe in gay adoption . She was told to do an activity where she would actually act gay in public,</p><p end="3902" is_meta="false" speaker="Greg Lukianoff" start="3846">which she pretended she did, as part of her degree, and then she said, "I'm never doing this again." She put on her big boy pants, as it were, when she was asked to sign a petition as part of her class supporting gay adoption. She fundamentally did not believe this was right . She said she wouldn't, and they brought h er into the room, and they threatened her basically with being kicked out of the program unless she actually changed her point of view, unless she decreased the distance -- the difference between her and the administration. There was a full investigation of this . It was absolutely horrible, the extent to which they were intolerant of an evangelical Christian's belief .</p><p end="3902" is_meta="false" speaker="Greg Lukianoff" start="3846">But she did fight. Then there's also E d Felkner, who was told he had to -- he actually had to -- he had to lobby for liberal causes at Rhode Island College or else not graduate .</p><p end="3963" is_meta="false" speaker="Greg Lukianoff" start="3902">And what he -- when he actually said, "Wait, I'm not a -- but I want to be in this field, but I don't actually believe in any of these things," he was not given the option to actually lobby for causes he believed in . The -- you've got to be really far gone if you think you have the power to compel people to take political stances they don't actually believe in.</p><p end="3963" is_meta="false" speaker="Jeremy Mayer" start="3902">Unless it's at Liberty University, then it's okay.</p><p end="3963" is_meta="false" speaker="Jeremy Mayer" start="3902">G reg Lukianoff :I wouldn't go to Liberty University.</p><p end="3963" is_meta="false" speaker="Jeremy Mayer" start="3902">[inaudible] student here tonight. We talked about date rape statistics --</p><p end="3963" is_meta="false" speaker="Jeremy Mayer" start="3902">-- without trigger warnings just last week.</p><p end="4020" is_meta="false" speaker="Jeremy Mayer" start="3963">No, it shouldn't be . It's a ridiculous --</p><p end="4020" is_meta="false" speaker="Jeremy Mayer" start="3963">-- perversion of --</p><p end="4143" is_meta="false" speaker="Angus Johnston" start="4083">Yeah, no . I think that I -- what I call it is a "content note," and I -- it's a way of --</p><p end="4201" is_meta="false" speaker="Kirsten Powers" start="4143">-- of living in fear that they're going to trigger anybody?</p><p end="4201" is_meta="false" speaker="Kirsten Powers" start="4143">Yeah.</p><p end="4201" is_meta="false" speaker="Angus Johnston" start="4143">I guess, two things -- first of all, in terms of the idea that this is infantilizing people -- the person who did the most to make me think about the importance of trigger warnings is actually in the audience here tonight. And she's a combat veteran. So, I don't believe that it's infantilizing.</p><p end="4259" is_meta="false" speaker="Angus Johnston" start="4201">Secondly, I would say that in Oberlin, there was never a -- it was never proposed as mandatory . Yes, students at Santa Barbara suggested that it should be mandatory, but students suggest things that are not that great of an idea all the time .</p><p end="4259" is_meta="true" speaker="Angus Johnston" start="4201">laughter</p><p end="4259" is_meta="false" speaker="Angus Johnston" start="4201">And in fact, in fact, the student who was behind -- one of the students who was behind the proposal at Santa Barbara wrote to me privately much later, saying that she thought that my solution was an excellent one, and she thought that the way that I had approac hed it, which was not mandatory, had advanced the debate in exactly the way she wanted it to be.</p><p end="4322" is_meta="false" speaker="Angus Johnston" start="4259">Heckl ers vet o is a horrible thing, and it shouldn't happen, and frankly, it's pretty rare . I would also note, though, if we're talking about the Hecklers Veto, that one of the situations that springs to my mind is an Israeli ambassador a few years ago, at UC Irvine,</p><p end="4322" is_meta="false" speaker="Angus Johnston" start="4259">who was not actually prevented from speaking . Students heckled him, but they didn't actually succeed in creating a veto . 11 students were arrested and charged with misdemeanors for engaging in free speech in that incident.</p><p end="4384" is_meta="false" speaker="Greg Lukianoff" start="4322">Oh, they absolutely do.</p><p end="4384" is_meta="false" speaker="Greg Lukianoff" start="4322">They absolutely do . They're a liberal idea based on sensitivity . I think they're well-</p><p end="4384" is_meta="false" speaker="Greg Lukianoff" start="4322">intentioned. I think a lot of speech codes ideas are well -intentioned. But here's my problem with trigger warnings . I wrote a short book called "Freedom from Speech," and I'm afraid that's kind of where we're headed . And but -- and here's -- and I can go to philosophical reasons why I think trigger warnings are dangerous . But here's the practical reason . Because seven humanities professors wrote Inside Highe r Education,</p><p end="4384" is_meta="false" speaker="Greg Lukianoff" start="4322">saying, "Oh, my God . These are becoming expectations . They're not mandatory yet, but because they're becoming expectations, I am receiving angry e -mails and angry letters from students and from administrators saying I better provide these." But guess what ?</p><p end="4384" is_meta="false" speaker="Greg Lukianoff" start="4322">It's impossible to know what actually might trigger them --</p><p end="4384" is_meta="false" speaker="Greg Lukianoff" start="4322">Because it's sensitivity -based -- it's a sensitivity -based warning idea that is absolutely in line with all of the speech codes we've been talking about --</p><p end="4384" is_meta="false" speaker="Greg Lukianoff" start="4322">-- the entire time.</p><p end="4440" is_meta="false" speaker="Kirsten Powers" start="4384">Yeah . Well, there was also a New Yorker article that was written by a Harvard Law professor, about the fac t that she -- she teaches rape law . And she has been -- had students demand that there be trigger warnings --</p><p end="4440" is_meta="false" speaker="Kirsten Powers" start="4384">And -- well, and the -- and has ultimately sort of culminated with the idea . And she says specifically that this is, you know, perpetrated by left- wing groups who are advising the students, to tell them that they shouldn't have to sit in a rape law class if it's upsetting to them, to the point that she said, surveying various professors a cross the country, that they are now giving up teaching rape law because of the fear --</p><p end="4440" is_meta="false" speaker="Kirsten Powers" start="4384">-- of the backlash from --</p><p end="4440" is_meta="false" speaker="Kirsten Powers" start="4384">-- the students.</p><p end="4440" is_meta="false" speaker="Jeremy Mayer" start="4384">But could I ask her a question?</p><p end="4440" is_meta="false" speaker="Jeremy Mayer" start="4384">If a campus said, "We are going to be the campus of sensitivity" --</p><p end="4440" is_meta="false" speaker="Jeremy Mayer" start="4384">-- "because of the danger" -- you'd be fine with that, right, because we have, again, in this town Catholic University, where students are so sensitive to prochoice .</p><p end="4500" is_meta="false" speaker="Jeremy Mayer" start="4440">-- that if anyone goes there, even if they're there to talk about acting or cooking have they ever been publicly prochoice ? That speech is ban ned.</p><p end="4500" is_meta="false" speaker="Greg Lukianoff" start="4440">And what was really ironic about Catholic is that they actually used to have relatively good policies on freedom of association . And they tried to start an NAACP chapter there, and Fire came in trying to -- defending the NAACP and holding them to their promises, and then they rescinded all those promises. So it was one of the times where it actually ended up backfiring.</p><p end="4500" is_meta="false" speaker="Jeremy Mayer" start="4440">But by your own principles, if a campus said we are sensitive to university PC plays,</p><p end="4500" is_meta="false" speaker="Jeremy Mayer" start="4440">you'd allegedly be okay with that because you're okay when right wing groups s et up a campus and say, all right, no pro choice can say --</p><p end="4500" is_meta="false" speaker="Greg Lukianoff" start="4440">They can . But if you really take this to its logical extreme, then they couldn't be universities because they literally couldn't talk about anything.</p><p end="4562" is_meta="false" speaker="Greg Lukianoff" start="4500">This evening, Kirsten and I have provided data and real examples demonstrating how liberals are stifling intellectual diversity on campus . But you don't have to take it from us . Just ask the professors themselves . In a 2012 study, a representative sample of about 300 social psychologists were asked if two job candidates with equal qualifications were to apply for an opening in your department, and you knew one was politically conservative, would you be inclined to vote for the more liberal one ? 82 percent of liberal social psychologists said they would at least be a little bit prejudice against the conservative applicant . This is shocking, especially when you consider that social psychologists are so o ften concerned about the harm of unconscious bias . It can be very hard to get respondents to concede that they might be prejudice . Not -- not so apparently with conservatives and Christians .</p><p end="4684" is_meta="false" speaker="Greg Lukianoff" start="4562">It's a well -known rule of social science that the more politically homogenous a group is,</p><p end="4684" is_meta="false" speaker="Greg Lukianoff" start="4562">the more radical in that direction it tends to become and the more the group begins to act as a tribe that sees outsiders as enemies who are either stupid or simply bad or greedy . Unfortunately, we're seeing this pl ay out within our colleges and universities .</p><p end="4684" is_meta="false" speaker="Greg Lukianoff" start="4562">Too many liberals are stifling intellectual diversity on campus and in doing so, they are encouraging people just to talk with those who they already agreed . There are endless rules for collect speech -- corre ct speech are encouraging people to keep their opinions to themselves . This only makes the tribalism problem worse and the walls of the echo chamber thicker. It's not supposed to be this way, and it doesn't have to be this way .</p><p end="4684" is_meta="false" speaker="Greg Lukianoff" start="4562">But the first step toward s recovery is admitting you have a problem. And on our campuses, we have a problem. And I hope you will all recognize tonight that liberals sadly are stifling intellectual diversity . Thank you.</p><p end="4684" is_meta="false" speaker="Jeremy Mayer" start="4562">A long time ago, I was a Republican at Brown University . And that was a tough gig.</p><p end="4684" is_meta="false" speaker="Jeremy Mayer" start="4562">There was social ostracism sometimes . People called me a racist . There are things that you go through with a Libertarian -minded Republican that I sympat hize with. But I don't believe, overall, that liberals are stifling intellectual kinds of diversity . I think a lot of these ideas, even the idea of trigger warning s are creating discussions about trauma and how we talk about it. When I was at college, my first month, a gay student group had a kiss -in in the mailroom. And back in -- '80 -- and today that's pretty normal at GW . That happens a lot of -- Thursd ay I think is the gay kiss -in .</p><p end="4684" is_meta="true" speaker="Jeremy Mayer" start="4562">laughter</p><p end="4684" is_meta="false" speaker="Jeremy Mayer" start="4562">But in '86, that was revolutionary to see boys or men and men and women and women kissing deeply . It really created a discussion . That's free speech.</p><p end="4743" is_meta="false" speaker="Jeremy Mayer" start="4684">And was it offensive, was it dangerous ? Did people -- yeah . But that's what a campus should be . A lot of the things we've heard tonight are anecdotes . The plural of anecdote is not data . There are things that happen on college campus es that I don't approve of, that I don't think a good liberal or for someone committed to free speech should a pprove of. But you know what ? That's what happens when 18 and 21 -year -</p><p end="4743" is_meta="false" speaker="Jeremy Mayer" start="4684">olds are passionate about their beliefs and they engage in a debate that we must desperately have . So , at the end of the day, I think a lot of conservatives are worried that their children are g oing to change to the left. And I have good news, we don't change children to the left. Jennings and Stoker in a longitudinal study found that college had absolutely no effect on political views of college students . Mariani and Hewitt found a small leftw ard change over time in college students that was exactly mirrored by what happened with the same age group that didn't go to college .</p><p end="4809" is_meta="false" speaker="Kirsten Powers" start="4743">If you're part of the dominant culture, which, on university campuses -- as we've established -- is primarily liberal -- it's easy to mistake your beliefs for objective truth .</p><p end="4809" is_meta="false" speaker="Kirsten Powers" start="4743">It's also easy to imagine there are no reasonable or intelligent people who think differently on important topics, because you're not encountering them . I know this because I've lived most of my life in the liberal bubble . There were two experiences that took me out of this . One was becoming a contributor at Fox News . And the other was a later in life conversion to Christianity . I can remember actually saying to somebody that I was debating at Fox that Harriet Miers -- who George Bush was -- had nominated for the Supreme Court -- didn't count as a female appointment, because she was a conservative and an evangelical Christian .</p><p end="4859" is_meta="false" speaker="Kirsten Powers" start="4809">I'm embarrassed, frankly, that I ever thought that . It was a prejudiced view, and unfortunately, I wasn't alone in my prejudice . A 2007 study of faculty on college campuses found that 53 percent had cool or negative feelings towards evangelical Christians . These levels of disapproval raise curious questions about how evangelical students are treated on campus . The onl y way that one could believe that liberals aren't stifling intellectual diversity on campuses is if they never visit FIRE's website and if they don't have any friendships with non- liberals. At a dinner party a couple weeks ago, I met a retired Stanford pr ofessor and a Harvard Law School student -- both evangelicals -</p><p end="4859" is_meta="false" speaker="Kirsten Powers" start="4809">- who described to me how they felt they had to hide their beliefs, lest they be ostracized or punished.</p><p end="4923" is_meta="false" speaker="Angus Johnston" start="4859">When I was an undergraduate s tudent, involved in various student organizations, I remember feeling afraid to talk about certain issues . I remember feeling like if I said the wrong thing, that I might get yelled at, or maybe somebody would even stop liking me.</p><p end="4982" is_meta="false" speaker="Angus Johnston" start="4923">I remember th at that scared me . And I remember that what it did sometimes is make me keep my mouth shut -- which, as a 19, 20, 21 -year -old white guy , was maybe not the worst thing that could happen to a person. But the other thing that it did is it made me think more seriously about what I was going to say . It made me chew on the stuff. And sometimes I did think seriously about what I was going to say, and I still said something that offended somebody else . And they let me know it. And here I am today, still alive ,</p><p end="4982" is_meta="false" speaker="Angus Johnston" start="4923">still doing okay . Part of free speech on campus is people being passionate about the degree to which they abhor what you say . I absolutely think that we need more free speech on campus when we're talking about administrators, and faculty imposing their</p><p end="4982" is_meta="false" speaker="Angus Johnston" start="4923">own values, whether ideological or not .</p><p end="5046" is_meta="false" speaker="Angus Johnston" start="4982">But I also absolutely think that we need to stand up for the right for people to engage in rowdy, obnoxious debate, because rowdy, obnoxious debate is what made me what I am and it's what made a lot of you what you are . So, in standing up for free speech, and standing up for rowdy, obnoxious debate, I would encourage you all to avoid stereotyping who are the people who are censoring and who are the people who are silencing . And the best way -- I was going to say the best way you could do that is vote against this motion, but I don't want to pressure you. I don't want you to feel silenced.</p><p end="5046" is_meta="false" speaker="Angus Johnston" start="4982">So , --</p><p end="5046" is_meta="true" speaker="Angus Johnston" start="4982">laughter</p></transcript></debate>
