No, I mean -- I'm not going to pick on the millennials. I think they're great. I think I've certainly gained more from mentoring any of them than I have contributed to any of their lives.</p><p end="426" is_meta="false" speaker="Binta Niambi Brown" start="365">My partner is Keith Campbell.</p><p end="488" is_meta="false" speaker="W. Keith Campbell" start="426">Yeah. I mean, people wrung their hands about me. Some still do.</p><p end="488" is_meta="false" speaker="W. Keith Campbell" start="426">I think the thing to keep in mind, there's a lot of positive you see in millennials;</p><p end="488" is_meta="false" speaker="W. Keith Campbell" start="426">tolerance for other people being a big one. But there are some down sides I'm going to talk about.</p><p end="488" is_meta="false" speaker="W. Keith Campbell" start="426">Yes.</p><p end="616" is_meta="false" speaker="Jessica Grose" start="555">Well, I mean, I couldn't just sit home and listen to my generation be maligned by people who don't understand us. So, you know, I had to come defend our honor.</p><p end="744" is_meta="false" speaker="W. Keith Campbell" start="673">Thanks. It's always nice when people mention "narcissism" and then they start laughing. I never know why, but it's always like a bad ex-relationship or something.</p><p end="744" is_meta="false" speaker="W. Keith Campbell" start="673">What I'm here to argue for is that "Millennials Don't Stand A Chance.&#8221; What I'm not here to do is malign millennials or bash millennials. That's fun. I just don't want to do it.</p><p end="744" is_meta="false" speaker="W. Keith Campbell" start="673">I don't want them to fail. I don't want my kids to fail either who are going to be the next generation. But, that said, I think there's a lot of problems. And to sum it up easily as I can I'd say there is a major disconnect or major gap between how young people were raised in the '80s and '90s, they're born in -- people born in the '80s and '90s, the millennials, and the world they're facing today. Think about it this way, they were raised with a very inflated optimistic view of themselves and the world. And they're --</p><p end="744" is_meta="false" speaker="W. Keith Campbell" start="673">we've given them a really terrible place to get a start. Let me just expand on this a little bit. If you think about the millennial self, these are kids that started -- that were born in the '80s, they started school right when the self-esteem movement hit. This was brought to us by the good people in California in 1982, started going through schools --</p><p end="744" is_meta="false" speaker="W. Keith Campbell" start="673">the idea was if we can give kids self-esteem they'll do better in life.</p><p end="817" is_meta="false" speaker="W. Keith Campbell" start="744">And the way to give kids self-esteem is not to have them succeed at optimal challenges or have strong relationships, which actually works, it was to tell them they're special and unique and give them lots of awards and trophies as people sort of lament. So we set people off that way. And we do have a generation with very high self-esteem, especially college students. Self-esteem is near the top of the scales we measure. We also see some of the darker side of self-esteem with that. We do see increasing narcissism. It wasn't like it was flat with Gen X and then jumped up, but it just keeps going up and up.</p><p end="817" is_meta="false" speaker="W. Keith Campbell" start="744">We see increasing uniqueness. We see this with the names we've given kids, and this is the millennials, but we're still doing this. I mean, now with our children born today we don't even give them names. If we're celebrities we name them directions on a compass so our --</p><p end="817" is_meta="false" speaker="W. Keith Campbell" start="744">[laughter]-- name them after fruit --</p><p end="817" is_meta="true" speaker="W. Keith Campbell" start="744">laughter</p><p end="817" is_meta="false" speaker="W. Keith Campbell" start="744">-- so these kids are given a sense of specialness, they think they're better than others.</p><p end="817" is_meta="false" speaker="W. Keith Campbell" start="744">We've raised expectations in young people dramatically, where they have high expectations about professional careers, they have high expectations about going to graduate school, and, again, it's great to raise expectations if you can provide a reality for that.</p><p end="874" is_meta="false" speaker="W. Keith Campbell" start="817">And finally there's been this big shift in values. There's been a switch from what we call "intrinsic values," which the baby boomers tended to have, to much more extrinsic values. To give you an example of the biggest change would be something like in the baby boom people said, "I want a meaningful philosophy of life.&#8221; People don't say that anymore. People aren't looking for their true self. What they're looking for now is a job to make lots of money. Again, that's fine, it just doesn't fit with our world. So if you take that inflated psychology the millennials were raised with and you look at reality right now, we have very high youth unemployment, we're talking about 12 -- a little over 12 percent for people in the young 20s with very liberal numbers of unemployment. We have a trillion dollars in student loan debt. And student loan debt is horrible. I mean, this isn't like, "Gee, I bought a McMansion . Oh, I can't afford it. I can live in it for three years and send the keys back."</p><p end="938" is_meta="false" speaker="W. Keith Campbell" start="874">And this is like "I can't get rid of this stuff because the government says, 'You can't get rid of it.'" You have massive levels of competition for jobs. You have massive levels of competition for those elite education tracks. I mean, people are hiring people to write college essays now, it's -- I mean, like paying to make 30 grand to get into college. The millennials are having to put off marriage. The average marriage age now for women is 27, 29 for men. You have over a third of young people 18 to 30 -- living back at home with their parents. Not necessarily in a basement. Lots of homes don't have basements, but maybe over the garage. Maybe someplace else. And yet -- I mean, even now, sociologists talk about this period of emerging adulthood -- age 20 to 24 -- which is something we didn't talk about 20 years ago. These people are in a cocoon and they're going to butterfly out as adults. And they might. We have decrease in civic engagements. Most measures we look at -- millennials volunteer more than any generation we've studied. So, that number has gone up.</p><p end="999" is_meta="false" speaker="W. Keith Campbell" start="938">They voted a lot for Obama's first term. But other than that, civic engagement has dropped. And generally, the sense of trust we have in the country for each other and for our major institutions -- our journalists, our government, our religion -- is at the lowest point we've ever measured. I mean, the country in terms of just our basic civil institutions is collapsing. Bottom line, and people grown up, raised by us -- they don't raise themselves. They're raised to have a very positive view and a very optimistic view.</p><p end="999" is_meta="false" speaker="W. Keith Campbell" start="938">And they're put in a reality that is incredibly challenging, incredibly negative. Some are making it. Some are doing great stuff in entrepreneurship. They're creating their own jobs. Other people are part of what I think of as the great fantasy migration. They're dressed up as Wookies or Stormtoopers, or they're living in their mom's basement,</p><p end="999" is_meta="false" speaker="W. Keith Campbell" start="938">playing World of Warcraft. And you get a lot of ego needs met that way and have a lot of good relationships. But that aside, it's very tough. And I apologize for being so negative on such a nice evening. Thank you.</p><p end="999" is_meta="true" speaker="W. Keith Campbell" start="938">laughter</p><p end="1056" is_meta="false" speaker="Jessica Grose" start="999">So, like John said, I call myself an "ancient millennial.&#8221; I was born in 1982, which is the first year in a lot of definitions of millennial. I have a baby, and a husband, and a mortgage, and all those things that Keith worries millennials will never have. We are the most racially diverse. We are the most educated generation of adults today. We've got the lowest amount of debt in 15 years. And that, you know, in part because we've seen what's happened to the world and we have decided to pull back on buying frivolous things.</p><p end="1118" is_meta="false" speaker="Jessica Grose" start="1056">We have healthy relationships with our parents, reported highest levels of healthiness among all adults today. And we have a deep entrepreneurial spirit, as the [unintelligible] mentioned. So, why do our detractors say that we're doomed? They saywe're immature, immoral narcissists who want to live in our parent's basement. It's always the basement. Or maybe the attic.</p><p end="1118" is_meta="true" speaker="Jessica Grose" start="1056">laughter</p><p end="1118" is_meta="false" speaker="Jessica Grose" start="1056">So, these stereotypes are based on false media narratives. And I am urging you to vote against the proposition because I'm going to dispel those falsehoods. And my partner,</p><p end="1118" is_meta="false" speaker="Jessica Grose" start="1056">David, he's going to tell you about some of the under reported truths about millennials.</p><p end="1118" is_meta="false" speaker="Jessica Grose" start="1056">So, let's start with that first myth, that basement myth. So, it's true that a greater percentage of millennials live at home than previous generations. But the degree to which that's true has been completely exaggerated. Keith said a third. That's not the numbers I've read. The numbers from Pew are that 15 percent of millennials live at home, compared to 12 percent of boomers and 13 percent of GenX. So, I don't know where they're getting that.</p><p end="1179" is_meta="false" speaker="Jessica Grose" start="1118">And the second part of the myth is that it's necessarily a bad thing. Half of the millennials who live at home are in college. And so, I think it's better for them to be living with their parents while they get an education than to be wasting money they don't have on dorms and apartments. So, the second part of the myth is that the people who aren't in college are just sponging and they're playing video games all day.</p><p end="1179" is_meta="false" speaker="Jessica Grose" start="1118">So, I have two examples here. One is Lena Dunham, because you cannot have a debate about millennials without mentioning Lena Dunham.</p><p end="1179" is_meta="true" speaker="Jessica Grose" start="1118">laughter</p><p end="1179" is_meta="false" speaker="Jessica Grose" start="1118">She is the creator of HBO's "Girls.&#8221; If you don't know who she is. She lived at home after graduating from college to make her first feature film, which went to South by Southwest and led directly to her being the creator, star, and writer of her own HBO show, which is the most zeitgeist-y show in generations. So, maybe you think, "Dunham is privileged. She's not a good example.&#8221; So, how about Sophia Amoruso? She was making $13 an hour. She was a community college dropout when she was living at --</p><p end="1179" is_meta="false" speaker="Jessica Grose" start="1118">with a family member in their cottage.</p><p end="1239" is_meta="false" speaker="Jessica Grose" start="1179">She started an online business, selling vintage clothing on eBay. That online business has turned into a multi-million dollar organization called "Nasty Gal Clothing.&#8221; She employs 300 people. So, I don't think she would have been able to do that if she had to pay rent on some bad apartment. Really having that support allowed her to launch herself into the world. So, the second myth is that we're immature. And some of this immaturity is said because we're not buying cars and we're not buying homes like the people in generations before us did. And that's not because we don't have the maturity.It's because we prefer to live sustainably, not just financially sustainably, but environmentally sustainably. We want to live in close communities. We use public transportation. And I think that that's all to the good. With the age of the McMansion and the SUV, the ginormous SUV, that's over, and good riddens to that. So the third myth is that we're immoral, and, as Keith mentioned, we're less religious.</p><p end="1298" is_meta="false" speaker="Jessica Grose" start="1239">But if you actually ask millennials why they've left the church or temple that they were raised in, a full third of them say that it's because of their church's values about the LGBT community. So I think that actually shows a huge amount of moral backbone to be able to question what you were raised in and to be able to say that you want to be on the right side of history. So the fourth myth, and it's the most pervasive myth, is that we are narcissists. And what galls me is that it's always the boomers saying this. And they were the original narcissists. I mean, I think they forget that Tom Wolfe called them "the me generation" in 1976. But -- so Keith has told you that we have this inflated, overoptimistic sense of the world. But that's not my impression at all. If you went back to 2000, David Brooks wrote an article in the Atlantic called "the organization kit.&#8221; It might have been 2001. I was either a freshman or sophomore in college. And that was a much more accurate picture of how we were raised.</p><p end="1365" is_meta="false" speaker="Jessica Grose" start="1298">We were raised to know that we are competing in a global world. Remember,</p><p end="1365" is_meta="false" speaker="Jessica Grose" start="1298">everybody had to learn Japanese in the '80s and '90s, because they wanted us to -- our parents wanted us to compete the same way that kids are learning Mandarin today.</p><p end="1365" is_meta="false" speaker="Jessica Grose" start="1298">And he says, you know, we are more narcissistic because we agree with statements like,</p><p end="1365" is_meta="false" speaker="Jessica Grose" start="1298">"I will be a success.&#8221; You know, those are just statements. You know, it's just words.</p><p end="1365" is_meta="false" speaker="Jessica Grose" start="1298">And I think actions speak so much stronger than that. As has been said, we volunteer more than any generation. 73 percent of millennials volunteered for a nonprofit in 2012. And the percentage of college freshman believing that it's essential or for very important to help people in need is the highest level it's been at in 40 years. There are the lowest levels of drug use, teen pregnancy and youth crime. That speaks louder than any multiple choice test to me. So I'm not going to stand here and say we weren't dealt a bad hand. Like it's been said, we graduated into a recession. The jobs are scarce, and that there are systemic problems in America with poverty and income inequality that plagues all generations, not just us.</p><p end="1422" is_meta="false" speaker="Jessica Grose" start="1365">But I think that millennials are uniquely qualified to solve these problems because we're committed to social justice, we're committed to sustainability, and we have this entrepreneurial spirit. So I really urge you to vote against the proposition because we are so far from doomed. We're just getting started.[applause]</p><p end="1481" is_meta="false" speaker="Binta Niambi Brown" start="1422">Good evening, everybody. So I'm a lover, I'm not a fighter. I'm not here to fight, I'm not here to bash, I'm not here to talk about all of the reasons why millennials are horrible people and are going to fail of their own doing because I don't believe that. I mentor millennials, and I educate them. And I am a firm believer in their capacity. With that said, the picture is not nearly as rosy as it's been painted by my esteemed opponent,</p><p end="1481" is_meta="false" speaker="Binta Niambi Brown" start="1422">Jessica. So a couple of things that I'd like to unpack. First, the notion that millennials are the most educated generation in the history of humanity, ever. We can look at that from a quantitative perspective, and we can also look at that from a qualitative perspective. Let's talk about it first quantitatively.</p><p end="1541" is_meta="false" speaker="Binta Niambi Brown" start="1481">My generation, generation X, the forgotten generation. Everybody likes to skip over us.</p><p end="1541" is_meta="false" speaker="Binta Niambi Brown" start="1481">We don't have complexes. We invent companies like Google, actually. It was X that invented Google, not Y. Correction from earlier tonight. So my generation, at this point,</p><p end="1541" is_meta="false" speaker="Binta Niambi Brown" start="1481">depending on the study you look at, we range in education from 30 to 45 percent having completed the equivalent of a four-year college degree. If you look at the Boomer Generation, between the ages of 55 to 64 -- and again, I'm reminding you of the quantitative versus the qualitative assessment. If you look at the boomer generation,</p><p end="1541" is_meta="false" speaker="Binta Niambi Brown" start="1481">the boomer generation is now around 32 percent. The very wonderful cohort that comes up behind me, they are currently at or estimated to be around 33 percent. So this notion that they have more education at this point in time than anybody else is actually not true from a quantitative perspective.</p><p end="1599" is_meta="false" speaker="Binta Niambi Brown" start="1541">It's also not true qualitatively. And what do I mean by that? The quality of education in the United States as we all know and have been reading about over and over and over again has been declining precipitously over the course of the last several decades, in particular as concerns science and mathematics. That people are taking tests, that they are taking APs, that they are going to college does not mean that they are learning any better, particularly in an environment where our government has insisted on teachers teaching to the test instead of developing deep critical analytical thinking skills that are absolutely and unequivocally necessary in our workplace. So qualitatively is not quite there either. Let's also discuss this notion of what a millennial is. I think far too often,</p><p end="1599" is_meta="false" speaker="Binta Niambi Brown" start="1541">when we're having conversations about when a millennial is and what a millennial isn't,</p><p end="1599" is_meta="false" speaker="Binta Niambi Brown" start="1541">we do talk about Lena Dunham, and we talk about Mark Zuckerberg. But I think that they are far and away the exceptions for the millennial population.</p><p end="1663" is_meta="false" speaker="Binta Niambi Brown" start="1599">As noted, the millennial group is the most diverse in the history of humanity. 43 percent are nonwhite. Of that 43 percent who are nonwhite, 35 percent of them are black and Hispanic. The black and Hispanic millennials are in primarily underperforming schools,</p><p end="1663" is_meta="false" speaker="Binta Niambi Brown" start="1599">they are mostly unemployed, they are not receiving college degrees at the same rate.</p><p end="1663" is_meta="false" speaker="Binta Niambi Brown" start="1599">And the situation for them is particularly bleak and really, really bad. I'm going to keep going with this theme a little bit further because we can't just talk about the exceptions.</p><p end="1663" is_meta="false" speaker="Binta Niambi Brown" start="1599">We have to talk about the whole. So when we say on our side that millennials don't stand a chance, we're not talking about Jess, we're not talking about David, we're not talking about a couple of my millennial mentees who are here tonight, we're not talking about the millennial entrepreneur whom I have given some advice to. We're talking about all of the rest of them. We can't focus on just 1 percent or 5 percent or 10 percent of the stars. So even with that, 66 percent of millennials are not earning college degrees, right?</p><p end="1724" is_meta="false" speaker="Binta Niambi Brown" start="1663">That sounds like it's a high number, and it's not when you think about the number of people who have actually earned their college degrees. But in an economy that is a knowledge-based economy, where increasingly we need people with these computer science and engineering degrees, it's pretty bad, right? And it's bad because, as was alluded to earlier tonight, we're entering into the age of artificial intelligence. We're entering into the age of machine learning. The kinds of jobs that we've prepared millennials to take, right, are not going to exist. And so then what do they do? They're going to end up in jobs and careers unless there is a dramatic intervention, which I will argue we need to have a dramatic intervention, then will end up in the kind of jobs and the kinds of careers where they are overeducated and underpaid. And that's not particularly good, particularly for a generation, as Keith has already said, which has $1.1 trillion worth of student debt, which, by the way, Jessica, is the reason many analysts are saying millennials are staying home.</p><p end="1782" is_meta="false" speaker="Binta Niambi Brown" start="1724">So I'm sure it's very nice to have anecdotal evidence suggesting that millennials are staying because they like their parents. I too like my parents. I'm extraordinarily close with my parents. I wish they could have made it tonight. I actually have a lot of millennial qualities. That's not a bad thing. But I think that financial independence for most of us and for most adults means that we want to move out of the house at a certain point. And that's important for another reason, not because we want people to over-consume, but because the traditional indicators for economic growth and what that relies upon is a form of consumption that relies on housing strikes that relies on housing formation, that relies on purchases of furniture and purchases of appliances and other things millennials are currently not able to afford in part because those who are college educated, who are not undereducated, right, so the undereducated millennials are in the absolute worst position.</p><p end="1847" is_meta="false" speaker="Binta Niambi Brown" start="1782">Those who are college educated, to the extent that they weren't qualified to get the high-tech jobs, which most of them are not qualified for, as I've already suggested,</p><p end="1847" is_meta="false" speaker="Binta Niambi Brown" start="1782">they're in jobs which don't actually require a college degree. And so they're not earning enough money. And this is isn't, by the way, any of their fault. I have about 45 seconds left, so I'm going to hit on two more important points. None of this is the fault of the millennial generation. All of this is the fault of the kinds of policies, Baby Boomers, the greatest generation, and even a few people who are in the Generation X in Washington right now have put into place. It's the absence of a good jobs policy. It's the inability for us to work on entitlement reform and shifting all of that burden to millennials. And so it's no wonder that this generation is completely stressed out. And if I had more time, I would begin to tell you about the very difficult numbers of 44 percent of college students evidencing or suggesting that they have some level of depression. Things are not as good as they seem. Thank you very much.</p><p end="1847" is_meta="true" speaker="Binta Niambi Brown" start="1782">applause</p><p end="2478" is_meta="false" speaker="Binta Niambi Brown" start="2406">So I think optimism is awesome. And I think that when you look at the level of optimism for generation X when we were the very same age as you guys are now, it was actually equal to your level of optimism. Optimism is not something that's lost upon the young,</p><p end="2478" is_meta="false" speaker="Binta Niambi Brown" start="2406">right? We expect the young to be optimistic. And I hope that you keep your optimism.</p><p end="2478" is_meta="false" speaker="Binta Niambi Brown" start="2406">David, I hope that you keep your pragmatic idealism, as you've written about. But the practical reality is that, as people grow older, and as their responsibilities increase, and as they do take on mortgages and have families and have additional constraints, the ability to service that optimism in every generation or over the course of history, it decreases, right? I hope that's not the case for millennials. But it's not anything special when you compare it to other generations, unfortunately.</p><p end="2536" is_meta="false" speaker="Binta Niambi Brown" start="2478">Can we just talk about --</p><p end="2536" is_meta="false" speaker="W. Keith Campbell" start="2478">"Keith" is good.</p><p end="2596" is_meta="false" speaker="W. Keith Campbell" start="2536">There are a lot of Keith Campbells out there, and I've gotten hate mail for some of them for cloning Keith.</p><p end="2596" is_meta="false" speaker="W. Keith Campbell" start="2536">-- before that, yeah.</p><p end="2596" is_meta="false" speaker="W. Keith Campbell" start="2536">John Donvan:So, Keith, respond to your opponent.</p><p end="2596" is_meta="false" speaker="W. Keith Campbell" start="2536">Optimism is fine. I'm not as big a fan. I'm a little more of a fan of self-control and sort of effectively moving towards goals rather than global optimism. I don't know if we're seeing that. I just -- I don't know. I don't know if there's data on our people saying,</p><p end="2596" is_meta="false" speaker="W. Keith Campbell" start="2536">look, I'm in trouble -- I'm going to do X, Y and Z to get out of trouble, or are they -- are they kind of moving into something else to get away from it. I just don't the answer to that.</p><p end="2596" is_meta="false" speaker="Jessica Grose" start="2536">I would say we are effectively moving towards goals. It was mentioned that millennials are putting off marriage and family, and that, in large part, is because women have flooded into the work force and have higher levels of educational attainment. And that's why it might seem like immaturity it you don't actually talk to millennials and look at the statistics.</p><p end="2663" is_meta="false" speaker="Jessica Grose" start="2596">They are putting off these things not out of a sense of immaturity but because they do want all of their ducks in a row. They're planning for these things. It just -- that planning takes longer. And I don't think that that is necessarily a bad thing. I mean, all of the studies show that older parents are better parents. So I just don't see how that's a cause for alarm. That's a cause for celebration.</p><p end="2663" is_meta="false" speaker="Binta Niambi Brown" start="2596">Just to talk about this context point, David, so first of all, it stinks to be young, having gone through what your generation has gone through. But keep in mind that not only did your generation go through all of the things your generation has gone through, but the X 'ers and the boomers and many members of the greatest generation have gone through the same. And some of them actually somewhat worse. I mean, I think our context is we were children of the Cold War. We were children of gas crises. We were children who saw the walls come down, sure. And that set into some of our optimism.</p><p end="2663" is_meta="false" speaker="Binta Niambi Brown" start="2596">But I think that you can look at any point in history and say, yes, but we're extra optimistic because of -- look at what we've gone through.</p><p end="2728" is_meta="false" speaker="Binta Niambi Brown" start="2663">That argument just doesn't really sit with me, particularly as -- when you think about what Keith is saying with optimism and what are the dangers, and there&#8216;s a rebuttal in part to Jessica. And I'm sorry to keep doing this to you. But one of the dangers with optimism is that it does fuel consumption. You say that your generation is more frugal,</p><p end="2728" is_meta="false" speaker="Binta Niambi Brown" start="2663">and in fact, studies shows that your generation has had the fastest increase from luxury consumption. I think I saw something along the lines of -- well, 25 percent of millennials report not having enough to cover their expenses. But at the same time, they've increased 33 percent in their purchases of premium fashion and services, more than any other generation.</p><p end="2824" is_meta="false" speaker="W. Keith Campbell" start="2772">Well, I think what we've traded, in a large part because it's the ability to have social networks, Facebook or whatever, is we have broader social networks. And young people have broader social networks than people who grew up before that. I think there's been a tradeoff of depth to some extent because it takes time to nurture a broad network. But the networks are certainly broader with young people. I just don't think the depth is necessarily deeper.</p><p end="2891" is_meta="false" speaker="Jessica Grose" start="2824">No, absolutely. I mean, I will make the example of G chat. I talk to my friends throughout the day on G chat, the same people over and over again, the same set of four women who, if, before the advent of technology, I would have had to call them,</p><p end="2891" is_meta="false" speaker="Jessica Grose" start="2824">walk over to them. The constant communication that we can have with our close compatriots is immeasurable. So, yes, we might have geographic distance or, you know,</p><p end="2891" is_meta="false" speaker="Jessica Grose" start="2824">we might have these broader, you know, networks of friends. But I think actually it enables a closeness. And I think, you know, the number of close friends that people have has not demonstrably changed. You know, I think people say it's three people that they consider confidantes. And I don't think that those numbers have moved.</p><p end="2946" is_meta="false" speaker="Binta Niambi Brown" start="2891">Yeah, I mean, I -- listen, from my perspective, I have a huge number of friends on all various forms of social media. And I use that as a means of bringing myself closer to them. I have a much broader set of relationships. But what I dispute is that millennials have a more diverse set of relationships.</p><p end="2946" is_meta="false" speaker="Binta Niambi Brown" start="2891">Well, because the studies don't show that. And empirical data and analysis doesn't show it either. Again, going back to that 43 percent nonwhite number, I do not see, on college campuses, close integration between the black and Hispanic populations and the white populations. I do not see, when I go to tech conferences, and there are a lot of young entrepreneurs around, a great integration there. I do not see it at social good conferences. I do not see it at like basically anywhere I go.</p><p end="3006" is_meta="false" speaker="Binta Niambi Brown" start="2946">One or two -- one or two as opposed to zero is not a real marginal improvement.</p><p end="3006" is_meta="false" speaker="Binta Niambi Brown" start="2946">David D. Burnstein:I mean, we could go back and forth about that percentage. But I think the question is that today you've got a group of people who are actually able to connect around real fences of ideas, people who are able to bond together in terms of thinking about, if you were someone who is interested in a particular topic or a particular interest, your ability 20 years ago to connect with people and have a conversation about that was relatively limited. The ability for someone to do that today is incredibly increased.</p><p end="3076" is_meta="false" speaker="Binta Niambi Brown" start="3006">And I would say that the examples of the conferences that you just mentioned are examples of part of what this generation has brought about. You look at the attendees of those conferences and those things that both of us attend you know that the large percentage of the people there are young, people who are engaged in trying to change the world and make the world a better place.</p><p end="3076" is_meta="false" speaker="W. Keith Campbell" start="3006">No, I -- well --</p><p end="3076" is_meta="false" speaker="W. Keith Campbell" start="3006">-- no, I mean, we're talking about personality trait, I mean, it --</p><p end="3076" is_meta="false" speaker="W. Keith Campbell" start="3006">-- I don't like to -- I mean, if -- diagnostic, it's harder to make that claim. I don't want to -</p><p end="3076" is_meta="false" speaker="W. Keith Campbell" start="3006">The narcissistic personality.</p><p end="3076" is_meta="false" speaker="W. Keith Campbell" start="3006">Well, it's having an inflated view of yourself and using relationships to regulate that. So if you're on Facebook, it's putting an attractive photo of yourself and bragging about yourself and having more Facebook connections. If it's in marriage you have a trophy spouse. So you sort of use your interpersonal relationships to bolster your self-image.</p><p end="3150" is_meta="false" speaker="W. Keith Campbell" start="3076">Well, it's good for you.</p><p end="3150" is_meta="true" speaker="W. Keith Campbell" start="3076">laughter</p><p end="3150" is_meta="false" speaker="W. Keith Campbell" start="3076">I mean, it works for you. It doesn't work for other people. That's the -- it's a problem.</p><p end="3150" is_meta="false" speaker="W. Keith Campbell" start="3076">Well, when you're being manipulated by somebody as a trophy or as a prop in their own life narrative --</p><p end="3150" is_meta="false" speaker="W. Keith Campbell" start="3076">-- it becomes problematic --</p><p end="3150" is_meta="false" speaker="W. Keith Campbell" start="3076">I'm saying the levels of narcissism have gone up about half a standard deviation which is shifting a little bit.</p><p end="3150" is_meta="false" speaker="W. Keith Campbell" start="3076">What happens at the extremes is that the extremes go up a lot. But the average millennial compared to the average Gen Xer on narcissism is not that different. What happens, though, is you -- when you shift everybody a little bit, the number of people at the extremes goes up a lot, and those are the ones that want to drive you crazy when you interview them for jobs --</p><p end="3150" is_meta="false" speaker="W. Keith Campbell" start="3076">-- or go out on dates with them.</p><p end="3209" is_meta="false" speaker="Jessica Grose" start="3150">Right.</p><p end="3209" is_meta="false" speaker="Jessica Grose" start="3150">I don't. I think it's a fundamental misunderstanding of the way we use social media.</p><p end="3209" is_meta="false" speaker="Jessica Grose" start="3150">Look, everyone is trying to present their best face to the world. We just are the first to have these tools, so, yes, maybe a pretty selfie of yourself might seem to be narcissistic but I think that that's just -- that's the way we move through the world. There is -- you know, studies -- this researcher, Danah Boyd, has looked at the way that teenagers and 20-somethings deal with the Internet, and there is -- I think with older people who weren't native to it, there's more of a divide. But it's really just a fluid thing. It's a fluid thing, so you're trying to put your best face to the world virtually just as you would try to put your best face to the world in person. And I just think that it's not actual evidence of anything except these tools existing.</p><p end="3267" is_meta="false" speaker="Jessica Grose" start="3209">John Donvan:Binta, I know this wasn't your ammunition that you brought in, but what's your response to Jessica on that?</p><p end="3267" is_meta="false" speaker="Binta Niambi Brown" start="3209">To selfies?</p><p end="3267" is_meta="false" speaker="Binta Niambi Brown" start="3209">Alissa [spelled phonetically], don't say anything. So I don't particularly understand them. I have a derivation of the selfie. I call it the "self-bomb," which is where it is not -</p><p end="3267" is_meta="false" speaker="Binta Niambi Brown" start="3209">- the point of it is not for me to look my very best but to show that a corner of myself was somewhere. So it'll be an eye or an eyebrow or something along those lines, but --</p><p end="3267" is_meta="false" speaker="Binta Niambi Brown" start="3209">Yeah, yeah, yeah.</p><p end="3267" is_meta="true" speaker="Binta Niambi Brown" start="3209">laughter</p><p end="3267" is_meta="false" speaker="Binta Niambi Brown" start="3209">I mean, but, look, I think that one of the things that's missing in this conversation -- and,</p><p end="3267" is_meta="false" speaker="Binta Niambi Brown" start="3209">you know, I -- all of the hair on my back raises when I hear what I have referred to as "millennial exceptionalism," because it focuses --</p><p end="3267" is_meta="false" speaker="Binta Niambi Brown" start="3209">I do.</p><p end="3335" is_meta="false" speaker="Binta Niambi Brown" start="3267">In the sense that everything is going so, so great, and the problem with it isn't to say that there aren't some things that aren't going incredibly well, but --</p><p end="3335" is_meta="false" speaker="Binta Niambi Brown" start="3267">Hang on. Hang on. Hang on. Hang on.</p><p end="3335" is_meta="true" speaker="Binta Niambi Brown" start="3267">laughter</p><p end="3335" is_meta="false" speaker="Binta Niambi Brown" start="3267">Our turn. Do not forget the forgotten generation.</p><p end="3335" is_meta="true" speaker="Binta Niambi Brown" start="3267">laughter</p><p end="3335" is_meta="false" speaker="Binta Niambi Brown" start="3267">You know, I get concerned when I hear about "We're -- the greatest is we're -- we're doing this, we're doing this, we're doing that," because it means that we're not focusing on the underlying problems. And the underlying problems are the reasons why -- and narcissism is one thing, some of these other things that you hear in the media -- I think the media has done millennials a complete disservice, because they're not focusing on what the actual issues are. And because they're not focusing on them, our policymakers aren't doing what our policymakers ought to be doing in order to help them out. I'm not going to get particularly excited about things like selfies. You know, I've been in a couple of them myself. I don't think that they're particularly harmful. I think that's the kind of thing that, you know, as people age, they either grow out of or they keep doing it. But I don't think that that is the reason why millennials are going to have a harder time in the workplace.</p><p end="3400" is_meta="false" speaker="W. Keith Campbell" start="3335">Well, the way I'd make the argument is that volunteering for exntrinsic reasons. So, it's done for college applications, or it's done because it's a requirement in high school.</p><p end="3442" is_meta="false" speaker="W. Keith Campbell" start="3400">Well, because the rates go up in the first couple of years of college and then they drop --</p><p end="3442" is_meta="false" speaker="W. Keith Campbell" start="3400">because kids are forced to do it now. I don't like making that argument. I think -- I'd say, look, a culture volunteering, that's a good thing. I'm not going to cover it up. But yeah, it's not a hard argument to make, because if you see all the data going one direction, except for one data point, but --</p><p end="3507" is_meta="false" speaker="Jessica Grose" start="3442">Well, I wanted to --</p><p end="3507" is_meta="false" speaker="Jessica Grose" start="3442">-- argue back against that, which is to say, you know --</p><p end="3507" is_meta="false" speaker="Jessica Grose" start="3442">-- minorities and women have historically had a harder time in America. And we're arguing millennials specifically are doomed. And actually, things are better for minorities and women than they have been in the past.</p><p end="3556" is_meta="false" speaker="Jessica Grose" start="3507">So, I just don't see how those are examples about how our generation specifically is doomed or having a hard time. Certainly those are -- the systemic problems that I mentioned in my intro, that we need to work on fixing. But as we are, racially the most diverse generation already, I think that we're particularly -- we have more global funds.</p><p end="3556" is_meta="false" speaker="Jessica Grose" start="3507">We have more global contacts. We're particularly equipped to fix these systemic problems that have plagued the United States forever, you know? So I just don't think that's evidence of how we specifically are doomed.</p><p end="3556" is_meta="false" speaker="Binta Niambi Brown" start="3507">I'm going to try to do this really quick. Of the 15 percent of millennials who are black --</p><p end="3556" is_meta="false" speaker="Binta Niambi Brown" start="3507">72 percent of those do not have four-year college degrees. 32-and-a-half percent of them are unemployed. Only 66 percent of black millennials graduated from high school.</p><p end="3556" is_meta="false" speaker="Binta Niambi Brown" start="3507">Of the 20 percent of millennials who are --</p><p end="3556" is_meta="false" speaker="Jessica Grose" start="3507">But how is that worse than --</p><p end="3556" is_meta="false" speaker="Binta Niambi Brown" start="3507">Hang on.</p><p end="3556" is_meta="false" speaker="Jessica Grose" start="3507">-- the last generation?</p><p end="3621" is_meta="false" speaker="Binta Niambi Brown" start="3556">It is -- actually, the numbers are showing declines and that it's worsening. You have an almost permanent underclass that's being created within your generation, according to many different analysts. We can shake our heads and we can say, "No," that that's not true. But the numbers are indicating --</p><p end="3621" is_meta="false" speaker="Jessica Grose" start="3556">I didn't say it wasn't true. I just said it's not --</p><p end="3621" is_meta="false" speaker="Binta Niambi Brown" start="3556">But the numbers are --</p><p end="3621" is_meta="false" speaker="Binta Niambi Brown" start="3556">-- but the numbers are indicating otherwise. With 81 percent of Hispanics, the largest cohort -- or soon to be the largest cohort -- 24.2 percent are unemployed. Same statistics, dreadful statistics.</p><p end="3621" is_meta="false" speaker="Binta Niambi Brown" start="3556">-- that are specifically affecting --</p><p end="3621" is_meta="false" speaker="Binta Niambi Brown" start="3556">-- this generation.</p><p end="3621" is_meta="false" speaker="Jessica Grose" start="3556">I just don't think that you've --</p><p end="3621" is_meta="false" speaker="Jessica Grose" start="3556">I mean, you say, you know, statistics show it's worse. You haven't cited those statistics.</p><p end="3621" is_meta="false" speaker="Jessica Grose" start="3556">I've never seen those statistics, that it's worse. I just think that that's demonstrably untrue. We see, you know --</p><p end="3685" is_meta="false" speaker="Jessica Grose" start="3621">Absolutely. The most -- the millennials are the most urban generation of adults today.</p><p end="3685" is_meta="false" speaker="Jessica Grose" start="3621">They are most like [unintelligible] that they really want to live in cities. They want to live closely together. They want to live in close communities. And all of this is [unintelligible] that -- and I don't think that they're moving away from not wanting to buy cars. I mean, part of that, yes, is financial. But part of that, if you look at the studies, is because they want to live in cities. They want to live close together. So I think that that's all evidence that shows that they have this commitment to living sustainably.</p><p end="3744" is_meta="false" speaker="Jessica Grose" start="3685">And there also is evidence that they want to spend -- when they do spend their money,</p><p end="3744" is_meta="false" speaker="Jessica Grose" start="3685">they want to spend it on experiences. They don't want to spend it on cars and homes.</p><p end="3744" is_meta="false" speaker="Jessica Grose" start="3685">And so that, again, is part of this sustainable lifestyle.</p><p end="3744" is_meta="false" speaker="W. Keith Campbell" start="3685">Well, I think that the car data is interesting. And I didn't know that car manufacturers are really worried about that and a lot of the shared economy. but in terms of the environmental -- and support for sustainability environment, I thought that would go up in millennials, and it's gone down dramatically from the Baby Boomers. And I thought about it for --</p><p end="3744" is_meta="false" speaker="W. Keith Campbell" start="3685">Dropped.</p><p end="3744" is_meta="false" speaker="W. Keith Campbell" start="3685">Yes.</p><p end="3744" is_meta="false" speaker="W. Keith Campbell" start="3685">And I thought about that, and I thought, well, Baby Boomers are the ones who gave us earth day, they're the ones who gave us the Clean Air Act and the clean water act. And I'm no, you know, supporter of the baby boom -- no offense to half the audience. But they really did a lot of this environmental work, the hard work that stopped Cleveland from burning and gen X and the millennials aren't doing it. So that -- we're just not seeing that in the data.</p><p end="3869" is_meta="false" speaker="Binta Niambi Brown" start="3813">Hi, Sadie. Thanks for your question.</p><p end="3869" is_meta="false" speaker="Binta Niambi Brown" start="3813">No. I don't know her. I like millennials. I think that they're great folks. I think the millennials I know are some of the hardest working, brightest people I've ever met, but I know that they're just a subset of the population.</p><p end="3923" is_meta="false" speaker="Binta Niambi Brown" start="3869">In terms of what you can do, I think that one of the most important things, and the thing that if it hasn't become evident to you all, that's on my mind, is that I'm worried about social exclusion, particularly when you have such a large percentage of millennials who are diverse. And I'm also worried about stress management. And these things actually go hand in hand because what the recent Pew Foundation study showed, which has been cited several times tonight by myself as well as by the other side, is that with such a large percentage of diverse people, larger than we've had in any other time, first of all, there's some people who are very, very concerned about decreasing trust in society. And trust is really important because only when we trust one another --</p><p end="3923" is_meta="false" speaker="Binta Niambi Brown" start="3869">John Donvan:Binta, Binta, let me just interrupt you --</p><p end="3923" is_meta="false" speaker="Binta Niambi Brown" start="3869">Sure.</p><p end="3977" is_meta="false" speaker="Binta Niambi Brown" start="3923">Well, no.</p><p end="3977" is_meta="true" speaker="Binta Niambi Brown" start="3923">laughter</p><p end="3977" is_meta="false" speaker="Binta Niambi Brown" start="3923">I don't --</p><p end="3977" is_meta="true" speaker="Binta Niambi Brown" start="3923">applause</p><p end="3977" is_meta="false" speaker="Binta Niambi Brown" start="3923">I disagree.</p><p end="3977" is_meta="false" speaker="Binta Niambi Brown" start="3923">I disagree because my purpose here tonight is not for us to be winners or losers. My purpose here tonight is to remind people as to why, as things stand today, millennials don't have a chance, right? So if you want to change that tide, which is something that we are all here responsible for doing, because we're all complicit in the mess that's been made. One of the things is by reaching out to people who aren't like you. Another of the things is protesting the teasing that occurs and cyber bullying that occurs that is affecting your generation and leading to increased suicide rates, things like that, you know, on our friend basis I think you can do. And then the last thing I would say you could do is you could urge your parents and policy makers to put in place responsible policies that will reverse the chances you have currently today.</p><p end="4085" is_meta="false" speaker="W. Keith Campbell" start="4032">Oh, perfect. He can go with anything. It's a very long answer to that because the thing about narcissism is it&#8217;ssomething that affects individuals and something that exists as a cultural phenomenon. And there are different ways to quantify both. Individuals, you can look at scores on tests. There's also a giant study out of NIH looking at symptoms of narcissistic personality disorder that found people in their 20s, the lifetime rates were about 1 in 11, about 1 in 3 for people in their 60s, or 1 in 30, excuse me. So there's --</p><p end="4085" is_meta="false" speaker="W. Keith Campbell" start="4032">and then there's other personality data that line up with that. So there're several data sets that show that general pattern of inflating self.</p><p end="4142" is_meta="false" speaker="W. Keith Campbell" start="4085">Yeah. It's a really interesting question, is it's culture changing and the millennials sort of hit -- getting most of it. So with something like Facebook, well, the millennials did it more than anybody, but now, you know, my mom's on Facebook.</p><p end="4142" is_meta="false" speaker="W. Keith Campbell" start="4085">Right. No.</p><p end="4142" is_meta="true" speaker="W. Keith Campbell" start="4085">laughter</p><p end="4142" is_meta="false" speaker="W. Keith Campbell" start="4085">W. Keith Campbell :Actually, now the millennials aren&#8217;t going to be on it pretty soon. They're going to be on Instagram. So is the whole culture change in millennials just getting the -- getting the biggest change? And I think that's probably what's going on. It's very hard to tease that apart with the data we have because most of the data we have come from college students, this historical data.</p><p end="4209" is_meta="false" speaker="W. Keith Campbell" start="4142">There's some research saying that when you spend too much time on Facebook you get sad because you look at everybody posting their wonderful life, and you compare it to your life that isn't quite as wonderful. So there's a little bit on that. Would that help you succeed? I mean, I don't know. I think it would make you sad.</p><p end="4209" is_meta="true" speaker="W. Keith Campbell" start="4142">laughter</p><p end="4329" is_meta="false" speaker="David D. Burstein" start="4265">I [inaudible].</p><p end="4329" is_meta="false" speaker="David D. Burstein" start="4265">In a word, "Yes," and, in fact, it's actually one of the great accomplishments I think of this generation. I mean, this is a generation of people who without whom it would have been -- it's very difficult to imagine our current president in the White House. And if you want to -- regardless of how you feel about the president, that doesn't matter. I mean,</p><p end="4329" is_meta="false" speaker="David D. Burstein" start="4265">this sense that this is a generation of people who said that they supported somebody and were able to organize and turn out in incredible numbers on behalf of that. So when you look at this, this is a generation that by 2020 will be a third of the electorate.</p><p end="4329" is_meta="false" speaker="David D. Burstein" start="4265">And they have shown an ability to care about politics, to get engaged in politics, and not -- and it's not just particularly on candidates. I mean, you look at SOPA and PIPA andwhat this generation did with -- aided by technology companies, be able to work on those things. You look at the Arab Spring, internationally.</p><p end="4385" is_meta="false" speaker="David D. Burstein" start="4329">You look at all these things where this generation is uniquely positioned to organized in a way that people of other generations are not really prepared to respond to. You look at just last week, CEO of Mozilla was routed out of their job in large part by millennials who didn't agree with his stance on gay marriage. So there's a incredible advantage that millennials have when it comes to social media, particularly in political -- politics and activism, because we have an understanding of that landscape as digital natives that immigrants don't particularly understand as well.</p><p end="4385" is_meta="false" speaker="W. Keith Campbell" start="4329">Yeah, I mean, I -- social media, like fire, you can use it for good or bad. The two points I'd make sort of in opposition to that is "Kony 2011" -- what was "Kony?"</p><p end="4439" is_meta="false" speaker="W. Keith Campbell" start="4385">the greatest movie of all time that people are now writing dissertations on. They have master&#8217;s on what they call "collectivism" or "selectivism," where people are willing to like a lot of things but don't really act. And in terms of the Obama campaign, I don't know if that was grassroots millennials doing that or if that was a bunch of Gen X behavioral economists figuring out how to manipulate millennials into voting. I mean, I think there's --[laughter]</p><p end="4439" is_meta="true" speaker="W. Keith Campbell" start="4385">applause</p><p end="4439" is_meta="false" speaker="W. Keith Campbell" start="4385">-- different opportunities, but that --</p><p end="4439" is_meta="false" speaker="W. Keith Campbell" start="4385">I'm just saying I know some of them.</p><p end="4439" is_meta="true" speaker="W. Keith Campbell" start="4385">laughter</p><p end="4439" is_meta="false" speaker="David D. Burstein" start="4385">Can I respond to that?</p><p end="4439" is_meta="false" speaker="W. Keith Campbell" start="4385">I mean, I just --</p><p end="4439" is_meta="true" speaker="W. Keith Campbell" start="4385">laughter</p><p end="4439" is_meta="false" speaker="W. Keith Campbell" start="4385">-- sorry. I can't really let that go. I mean, I think first of all, I mean, this notion of collectivism and selectivism is one I really have to push back on.</p><p end="4509" is_meta="false" speaker="David D. Burstein" start="4439">So "collectivism" is essentially this idea that all people are doing is clicking on things and they don't really care about anything. So people are liking a Facebook post and they think, "Here is this great thing I've done for the world by clicking a button on this thing,</p><p end="4509" is_meta="false" speaker="David D.

Burstein" start="4439">"this year, and now I'm going to go home," I think it's a -- I mean, people are laughing as I'm saying this, it's kind of a ridiculous idea. Sure a lot of people watched that "Kony 2012" video -- why did they watch it? People didn't think they were doing an act of heroism by watching that video, but I tell you one thing, more people in this generation know about an African warlord than previous generations knew and what he's doing and the human rights abuses he's carrying out. So I think when you think about the fact that more people in this generation have awareness about the rest of the world and the problems in the world and have some level of engagement, everything we know about human behavior and how people evolve over time suggests that if you get engaged with a global issue, have one smidge of awareness, or you donate to something when you're younger, the chances that over the long term that behavior is never going to manifest ever again, that would defy everything we know about human behavior and how people develop.</p><p end="4570" is_meta="false" speaker="Binta Niambi Brown" start="4509">I mean, KONY is such a funny example, because aside from the fact that --</p><p end="4570" is_meta="false" speaker="Binta Niambi Brown" start="4509">You know, I don't remember all the --</p><p end="4570" is_meta="false" speaker="Binta Niambi Brown" start="4509">-- details.</p><p end="4570" is_meta="false" speaker="Binta Niambi Brown" start="4509">A non-profit.</p><p end="4570" is_meta="false" speaker="Binta Niambi Brown" start="4509">Right.</p><p end="4570" is_meta="false" speaker="Binta Niambi Brown" start="4509">Right.</p><p end="4623" is_meta="false" speaker="Binta Niambi Brown" start="4570">I mean, the day was a bit of a bust, in part, of his personal issues. But it was also a bit of a bust because the issue had largely resolved itself before the video came out. And it was also a bust because there was a very large percentage of people in Uganda and throughout the African continent who were extraordinarily offended by that video. You know, it was a video that was done without having a lot of close interaction. I mean, we talk about, you know, social media and technology and the different ways of [inaudible]</p><p end="4623" is_meta="false" speaker="Binta Niambi Brown" start="4570">--</p><p end="4623" is_meta="false" speaker="Binta Niambi Brown" start="4570">Right.</p><p end="4623" is_meta="false" speaker="Jessica Grose" start="4570">[inaudible] --</p><p end="4623" is_meta="false" speaker="Jessica Grose" start="4570">-- of one social media work to actually make change in this country?</p><p end="4623" is_meta="false" speaker="Jessica Grose" start="4570">Sure.</p><p end="4623" is_meta="false" speaker="Jessica Grose" start="4570">But I think that --</p><p end="4623" is_meta="false" speaker="Jessica Grose" start="4570">-- you know, in the sixties, I think there was a great naivete in a lot of the activists that were -- I mean --</p><p end="4623" is_meta="false" speaker="Jessica Grose" start="4570">-- these activists are [inaudible] --</p><p end="4623" is_meta="false" speaker="Jessica Grose" start="4570">John Donvan:-- well-landed.</p><p end="4623" is_meta="true" speaker="Jessica Grose" start="4570">laughter</p><p end="4623" is_meta="true" speaker="Jessica Grose" start="4570">applause</p><p end="4623" is_meta="false" speaker="Jessica Grose" start="4570">Jessica Grose.</p><p end="4685" is_meta="false" speaker="Jessica Grose" start="4623">Youth activists are often deeply na&#239;ve. I mean, so, the two examples off the top of my head. One was when Susan G. Komen For The Cure, the breast cancer organization,</p><p end="4685" is_meta="false" speaker="Jessica Grose" start="4623">stopped -- went against Planned Parenthood and wasn't giving money to Planned Parenthood anymore. There was a huge uproar. And it basically -- I mean, the CEO was ousted. It completely ruined the -- it didn't ruin the organization. But it gave them a really hard time. And it got a lot more people aware. And not just of breast cancer --</p><p end="4685" is_meta="false" speaker="Jessica Grose" start="4623">which it did. But also about Planned Parenthood and the work it does. And another -- I write a lot about women's issues. So, the other thing was Wendy Davis and her stand in Texas, and how quickly that circulated around the Internet and made people aware of the issues about abortion rights in Texas. And then a swarm of mostly millennial women stormed the Texas statehouse because they were so -- ultimately it didn't work out, you know? The elected officials in Texas are largely Republican, and they did end up passing that anti-choice bill.</p><p end="4747" is_meta="false" speaker="Jessica Grose" start="4685">But still, like, there was just this ground swell of support and activism that did not just raise awareness, but I think could be argued, made change. So, I think it's not just clicking on something. People are getting enraged and making action and voting, you know? Young women really care about these issues, and they are constantly aware of them.</p><p end="4865" is_meta="false" speaker="Jessica Grose" start="4812">I'm not arguing that.</p><p end="4865" is_meta="false" speaker="Jessica Grose" start="4812">I'm just arguing that we're not -- the proposition is that we're doomed. I don't think we're doomed. I don't think that we're anything special, but it's just, you know, we have a lot of skills. And one that we haven't talked about before is that we are native to the technology, which is is to use a lame Silicone Valley word, "Disrupting" the world.</p><p end="4923" is_meta="false" speaker="Jessica Grose" start="4865">And we understand those technologies much more deeply than the older generations,</p><p end="4923" is_meta="false" speaker="Jessica Grose" start="4865">and we are able to harness those technologies. And I think that's that not even been addressed.</p><p end="4923" is_meta="false" speaker="Binta Niambi Brown" start="4865">I think that that's so unfair. I mean, generation X was known as the computer generation. It is also known as the digital generation. When I was 12 years old, I was playing on things called "bulletin boards" which was an early version of the internet. I wrote my senior thesis in 1995 on the internet and all of the different ways it's going to change society.</p><p end="4923" is_meta="false" speaker="Binta Niambi Brown" start="4865">Well, hang on -- hang on. Hang on. The companies that you're talking about that make you digital natives, right, were all founded by, for the most part, with the exception of Facebook, were by and large founded by people in generation X. It's simply inaccurate every time somebody says that the millennial generation is the only generation --</p><p end="4923" is_meta="false" speaker="Binta Niambi Brown" start="4865">-- that gets to [unintelligible].</p><p end="4983" is_meta="false" speaker="Jessica Grose" start="4923">Well, I would say there's been a democratization of technology. That --</p><p end="4983" is_meta="false" speaker="Binta Niambi Brown" start="4923">That's true.</p><p end="4983" is_meta="false" speaker="Jessica Grose" start="4923">The majority of millennials grew up with it whereas, gen X, it was a very privileged thing for them to grow up and have, you know, internet in the home. Like the numbers have just skyrocketed.so I think it's different in that way.</p><p end="4983" is_meta="false" speaker="Binta Niambi Brown" start="4923">Okay. So when you create something, I would submit to you that you have a pretty good understanding as to how to use it.</p><p end="5043" is_meta="false" speaker="Binta Niambi Brown" start="4983">And at the same time that your generation was becoming used to using these technologies, older generations have also become used to using these technologies.</p><p end="5043" is_meta="false" speaker="Binta Niambi Brown" start="4983">Now, the boomers, maybe they were a little bit slower, and the greatest generation -- I mean, I don't know what they do. But they're silent. They're silent, right? But I just think that it's a little bit misleading, right? There's a difference between -- you know, we oftentimes talk about millennials and being digital savvy. Having the ability to make a Facebook post or to take a selfie or to SnapChat or to engage on whatsapp is not digital savvy. Having the ability to create the button is digital savvy.</p><p end="5043" is_meta="false" speaker="Jessica Grose" start="4983">Right. And more of them know how to code than people in generation X.</p><p end="5107" is_meta="false" speaker="W. Keith Campbell" start="5043">Thank you. I don't have any prepared remarks here. I'm just going to wing it based on the last conversation.</p><p end="5107" is_meta="false" speaker="Binta Niambi Brown" start="5043">Like a millennial.</p><p end="5107" is_meta="false" speaker="W. Keith Campbell" start="5043">And -- like a millennial. No. That's --</p><p end="5107" is_meta="true" speaker="W. Keith Campbell" start="5043">laughter</p><p end="5107" is_meta="false" speaker="W. Keith Campbell" start="5043">Don't even have millennial jokes. So often what I -- often when I think about things, I think, what do I tell my students, and what do I want for my children who are going to be the next generation? And I'm scared. I mean, I'm scared for the future they have maybe because I lack optimism or maybe because I'm realistic. I don't know. You can decide. I tell my students, figure out something to do that they can't do in China and that a robot or AI won't be able to do in five or ten years, because that's what's going to happen to a lot of the jobs.</p><p end="5170" is_meta="false" speaker="W. Keith Campbell" start="5107">I tell my -- grad students to learn how to code, to learn really sophisticated statistics so they can maybe get a job because they're the only one who can do it, and so they're not underemployed in the service industry. And I hope to God my daughter becomes a physician so, you know, if things get really bad, they'll keep her alive to care for the young. So I --[laughter]</p><p end="5170" is_meta="false" speaker="W. Keith Campbell" start="5107">So I think I'm truly negative about things. Does that mean it can't change? Well, maybe.</p><p end="5170" is_meta="false" speaker="W. Keith Campbell" start="5107">But it should have changed. We've had eight years of collapse. People should have done something. And what we decided to do is give a whole lot of money to bankers,</p><p end="5170" is_meta="false" speaker="W. Keith Campbell" start="5107">which is great for New York when I looked around. But we haven't done anything so far.</p><p end="5170" is_meta="false" speaker="W. Keith Campbell" start="5107">And so to me, that doesn't sound like we're going to do anything in the future. You have my time.</p><p end="5235" is_meta="false" speaker="Jessica Grose" start="5170">So the people on this panel all seem to have very short historical memories. We don't seem to have discussed anything before 1930, so I'd like to do that now. If you looked at income inequality in the gilded age, in the late 19th century and the early -- and the turn of the century, it was even worse than it is now. Opportunity -- class movement was even lower than it is now. Poverty was endemic, and it was much -- it is worse than it is now. And I am sure there are newspaper columnists writing in 1870 that the gen --</p><p end="5235" is_meta="false" speaker="Jessica Grose" start="5170">the millennial, the horse millennials, or whatever they were calling the buggy riders,</p><p end="5235" is_meta="false" speaker="Jessica Grose" start="5170">whatever they were calling them in 1870, were uniquely doomed. So I just think that a lot of the way we frame millennials is based on a period of prosperity in the '60s, which was, in and of itself, the anomaly in American history.</p><p end="5283" is_meta="false" speaker="Jessica Grose" start="5235">And that's when we talk about marriage, when we talk about children, the age at first marriage in the 1910s and 1920s was in the late -- was, you know, 28 or 29. It was similar to how it is today. So I think we have this warped perspective of, you know,</p><p end="5283" is_meta="false" speaker="Jessica Grose" start="5235">what's facing millennials and how we can -- and then how we can face those problems.We are a fine generation. We are as fine a generation as a group of 20 million people can be compared to an aggregate of 20 million other people. So I would really urge you to urge against the idea that we are specifically doomed, especially when compared to the generations, centuries of generations that have come before us.</p><p end="5348" is_meta="false" speaker="Binta Niambi Brown" start="5283">So I have a confession to make. Last night while I was watching a video on my iPad and exchanging texts with mentees, friends and my mother, and doing some work for a startup I advise, and preparing for this evening, I took the Pew Foundation, "Are you a millennial?" quiz. And I scored an 80, which means that I share more traits with the millennials, actually, than with my own generation, the forgotten generation, the X'ers.</p><p end="5348" is_meta="false" speaker="Binta Niambi Brown" start="5283">I'm not surprised by this. I spend a lot of time with millennials. My parents are Baby Boomers. And I really, really like my parents a lot. So it may seem like tonight I'm arguing against myself, except that I'm not because of the accident of my birth. The fact that I was born 8 to 15 years before the beginning of the millennial generation means that the kinds of reckless policies that have been delimiting life chances for millennials today have not taken root and have not had a substantial impact on my prospective outcome. Things for millennials are not good.</p><p end="5412" is_meta="false" speaker="Binta Niambi Brown" start="5348">We've let this generation down. We've handed them a bad deal. It's because of our shortsightedness that we have a world with a number of structural and systemic problems that dramatically decrease the likelihood of their life chances. Our education system is failing, our entitlement system is broken. It's hard for them to find engaging work in order for them to become full economic participants. There is increasing distrust and the -- amongst the millennial generation, amongst different groups of people, contrary to what we've heard tonight. And so I'm asking you all tonight not to vote for us because we need to win, because in a sense, we already have. We were born before they were into a world where we had greater opportunity. I'm asking you to vote for us because to do so is a tacit recognition that a problem does in fact exist.</p><p end="5412" is_meta="false" speaker="Binta Niambi Brown" start="5348">And unless we recognize that a problem exists, we cannot solve it. And what I wouldlike to see is for some of these infrastructural and structural problems to be addressed and resolved. So vote for the proposition, not that millennials are doomed, but that they do not have a chance as things stand today.</p><p end="5412" is_meta="true" speaker="Binta Niambi Brown" start="5348">applause</p></transcript></debate>
