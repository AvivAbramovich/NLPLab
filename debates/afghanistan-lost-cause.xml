At times, I do. I just had lunch the other day with a friend of mine who is back on R &amp; R from State doing a job like I used to do in Eastern Afghanistan. And you do have pangs of guilt, but they're pangs, and they go away when you realize that there's a larger issue here in terms of what's of benefit to U.S. national interest.</p><p end="410" is_meta="false" speaker="Matthew Hoh" start="348">Thank you. It's an honor to be here tonight, particularly on this stage with Peter and Max, who are all acknowledged experts in this field. Also a little daunting. I've done a lot of panels. I've never done a debate with clocks and buzzers and voting. So cut me some slack. I'm also local. I'm from Jersey, if that helps in the voting process as well.</p><p end="410" is_meta="true" speaker="Matthew Hoh" start="348">applause</p><p end="410" is_meta="false" speaker="Matthew Hoh" start="348">But I just want to say also, too, if there're any Marines in the room, happy birthday Marines. Today is the 235th birthday of the Marine Corps. [applause] And it's appropriate to be having this discussion tonight because, you know, so far this year in Afghanistan, or so far this month in Afghanistan, the first ten days in November, we've seen 16 service members killed, many of them marines.</p><p end="468" is_meta="false" speaker="Matthew Hoh" start="410">So it's important for us to have a discussion on a day like this because it's those service members and their families who are bearing the direct costs of this conflict. You're going to hear tonight a lot of nuanced and complex arguments between us. And that's about right because the United States is entangled in a very complicated situation. To use the term civil war is not incorrect. You're going to hear us disagree on the relationship between the Taliban and al-Qaeda. I found, in my experience, in both eastern and southern Afghanistan, that the vast, vast majority of the Taliban that are fighting ourtroops every day are not wedded to an ideology that al-Qaeda embraces, that they are fighting occupation, and they are not fighting for some type of transnational jihad.</p><p end="525" is_meta="false" speaker="Matthew Hoh" start="468">You will see us disagree over the similarities between the Iraq and Afghan surge. Again,</p><p end="525" is_meta="false" speaker="Matthew Hoh" start="468">I was in both. I was fully invested in the Iraq surge in 2006 in Anbar province, I was one of the first civilian surge members last year into Afghanistan. And there are similarities between the Iraq surge and the Afghan surge. But those similarities are more in terms of how the US is doing policy and how we didn't do things right to begin with in Iraq and now all those policies we're doing wrong in Afghanistan. And I look forward to a discussion. I know Nir's got a lot of comments on this, and I look forward to having this talk with Peter and Max. You're also going to hear a lot of facts, figures and statistics tonight. And I want you to keep in mind the big picture. I want you to ask, so what?</p><p end="591" is_meta="false" speaker="Matthew Hoh" start="525">After every fact or figure or statistic you hear. Hopefully when Peter and Max say it and not when Nir and I say it, because it's just a case of don't lose sight or track of the forest because of the trees. And so keep in mind, bear in mind some basic aspects of the war in Afghanistan. The cost. Last year we spent -- the United States spent $104 billion in Afghanistan. This year, we are projected to spend $119 billion in Afghanistan.</p><p end="591" is_meta="false" speaker="Matthew Hoh" start="525">Afghanistan's GDP is $14 billion. We are spending seven times as much in that country as it's worth. As the Dutch, the Canadian, probably the French and Italians move out of Afghanistan, of course, our costs will go up. And so when you hear the administration say, we're looking at keeping this policy in place till 2014, that's a half trillion price tag plus about 2400 dead American and coalition soldiers as well as thousands more Afghans at this pace.</p><p end="647" is_meta="false" speaker="Matthew Hoh" start="591">Keep in mind that since 2005, we have seen a fivefold increase in U.S. and NATO troops in Afghanistan. Literally every year since 2005, we have doubled the foreign troop presence in Afghanistan. And what's occurred from that is that only every year a commensurate rise in violence, a commensurate rise in support for the Taliban and a decrease in support for the Karzai government. You see this with a number of Taliban.</p><p end="647" is_meta="false" speaker="Matthew Hoh" start="591">In 2005, we estimated there are 2000 active duty fighters in Afghanistan. Now we're estimating there are 35 to 40,000 active duty Taliban fighters in Afghanistan. So not only is the policy expensive, failing, it's also counterproductive because it's causing people to join the insurgency.</p><p end="707" is_meta="false" speaker="Matthew Hoh" start="647">It's exasperating the conflict, and it's making the region less stable. And that includes Pakistan. Additionally, keep in mind the nature of al-Qaeda. Keep in mind it is only 50 to a hundred members of al-Qaeda in Afghanistan, according to our CIA. And contrastthat with the 1,000 -- the 2,000 members of al-Qaeda that our State Department said are still in Iraq in their report last August on terrorism. Contrast that with the fact that the German police say there are 45 members of al-Qaeda in Hamburg, Germany. Hamburg being the place that probably had as much to do with the planning, if not more, for the 9/11 attacks than Afghanistan. And before I forget to put a plug in for a great article on the nature of al-Qaeda on Khalid Sheikh Mohammed and on 9/11, please read the &#8220;New Yorker&#8221; article from September by Terry McDermott. Really shows how al-Qaeda is this grouping of individuals.</p><p end="767" is_meta="false" speaker="Matthew Hoh" start="707">It's a collection of individuals. It's not a formal military organization that we can defeat with conventional forces. And think about it. Look back at the last 10 years of their attacks. Their most recent attack, a lady who took two parcel bombs and FedExed them from Yemen. Look at the attacks of the last three years in this country in the sense that they're done by individuals, small cells, it's a decentralized organization that will not be affected by the presence of brigade combat teams occupying Southern Afghanistan. So nine years ago 19 men hijacked four airplanes. We're now in Afghanistan 109 months later with 100,000 troops spending over $100 billion a year. Nir and I are not advocating for us to cut and run or abandon Afghanistan but we are advocating for a policy that is not destabilizing, not counterproductive, and not effective against Afghanistan.</p><p end="829" is_meta="false" speaker="Matthew Hoh" start="767">We're arguing for something that will -- or against al-Qaeda, we're actually arguing for something that will affect al-Qaeda and stabilize the region. Thank you.</p><p end="829" is_meta="true" speaker="Matthew Hoh" start="767">applause</p><p end="829" is_meta="false" speaker="Max Boot" start="767">It was really night and day, John. I mean, I've actually been reading about the Soviet War in the 1980s for a book that I'm now writing on the history of guerilla warfare, and it is so totally different from what we're doing, I mean, the Soviets really fought in the scorched earth manner, they killed over a million Afghans, they turned over five million into refugees, they destroyed the countryside, they threw landmines around indiscriminately --</p><p end="883" is_meta="false" speaker="Max Boot" start="829">-- completely different from what -- the kind of tactics that we're employing today.</p><p end="883" is_meta="false" speaker="Max Boot" start="829">Thank you very much, John. It's a pleasure to be here. And I'd like to extend my sympathies to our distinguished opponents on the other side.</p><p end="883" is_meta="true" speaker="Max Boot" start="829">laughter</p><p end="883" is_meta="false" speaker="Max Boot" start="829">I know they will make a valiant attempt as you've already heard Matt do, but I'm very sorry to say they have an impossible burden of proof today. They have to convince you that it's impossible for America and our allies to prevail in Afghanistan, that there is no way we can achieve our objective, which isn't to create paradise on earth, but merely an Afghanistan that is free of terrorist safe havens and that can secure and govern itself. For our part, we don't have to convince you that success is assured; only that it's possible.</p><p end="883" is_meta="false" speaker="Max Boot" start="829">For anyone familiar with military history, that ought to be a no-brainer.</p><p end="947" is_meta="false" speaker="Max Boot" start="883">Numerous countries have won wars after overcoming obstacles far more severe than those we face today. Think of Britain standing alone against the Nazis in 1940. Think of U.S. forces almost being pushed off the Green Peninsula in the summer of 1950, or more recently, think of Iraq in 2006. Now, you will hear, as you've already heard from Matt,</p><p end="947" is_meta="false" speaker="Max Boot" start="883">our opponents say that Afghanistan isn't Iraq. And they're right. Iraq was much worse.</p><p end="947" is_meta="false" speaker="Max Boot" start="883">In 2006 Iraq was in the throes of a full-blown civil war. That year 34,000 civilians died,</p><p end="947" is_meta="false" speaker="Max Boot" start="883">Shi&#8217;a and Sunni terrorists had high levels of support in their sectarian communities,</p><p end="947" is_meta="false" speaker="Max Boot" start="883">Prime Minister Maliki&#8217;s government was implicated in death squad activity, and back home the Democrats won majorities in Congress on an antiwar platform. Even many supporters of the war effort thought we were on the brink of defeat. For example, on August 9th of 2006, I wrote in the L.A. Times, "Bush needs to do something radical to shake up a deteriorating status quo if we are to have any hope of averting the worst American military defeat since Vietnam.&#8221;</p><p end="1008" is_meta="false" speaker="Max Boot" start="947">Luckily President Bush did do something radical. He ordered a surge which turned around a war effort which many had written off as hopeless. Today another surge is juststarting, and it actually has better prospects of success because the situation in Afghanistan is objectively much better than it was in Iraq. Yes, civilian casualties are up,</p><p end="1008" is_meta="false" speaker="Max Boot" start="947">but they're still 1/16th as high as they were in Iraq. Yes, violence has spread, but 63 percent of attacks still happen in just three provinces. Yes, there is the stress among ethnic groups. We are not facing a civil war. This is an intra-Pashtun conflict. Yes,</p><p end="1008" is_meta="false" speaker="Max Boot" start="947">Hamid Karzai is a problematic leader, but at least he is not running death squads and he has cooperated on important initiatives such as the village security program. And, yes,</p><p end="1008" is_meta="false" speaker="Max Boot" start="947">public opinion has turned against the war, but President Obama will receive a lot more support from Republicans than President Bush received from Democrats. I am also relatively optimistic about Afghanistan because the armed forces have gotten much better at counterinsurgency.</p><p end="1066" is_meta="false" speaker="Max Boot" start="1008">The COIN strategy that General Petraeus is implementing today draws not only on the war in Iraq, but also in conflicts as diverse as Columbia, El Salvador, Malaya, and the Philippines. He is not only focusing on kinetic operations, killing the enemy, but also on improving governance, intelligence collection, the handling of detainees, information operations and much more. It&#8217;s a huge difference from the sleepy days of 2008 when there were only 32,000 U.S. troops in the country and they were stuck in a holding pattern. Now we have a hundred thousands troops there. The last of the surge forces only arrived in September but already they&#8217;re making a difference. This summer I visited Nawa in Helmand province. Before the Marines got there in 2009, it was a virtual ghost town dominated by the Taliban. Today, it&#8217;s safe enough to walk around without body armor. Stores and schools have reopened, electrical lines are going up. Agricultural canals are being cleared. This is tangible progress.</p><p end="1125" is_meta="false" speaker="Max Boot" start="1066">Similar operations are now in full-swing around Kandahar, the heartland of the Taliban.</p><p end="1125" is_meta="false" speaker="Max Boot" start="1066">The New York Times, hardly a pro-war organ, reported on October 20, &#8220;American and Afghan forces have been routing the Taliban in much of Kandahar Province in recent weeks forcing many hardened fighters to flee strongholds they have held for years.&#8221; We are also seeing stepped-up operations to capture or kill Taliban and Haqqani leaders. In the past 90 days, Special Operations forces have carried out more than 1,500 operations resulting in the death or capture of almost 3,800 insurgents. Air strikes have more than doubled over the past year and yet according to the U.N., civilian deaths from NATO bombings were down 64 percent in the first half of the year. That&#8217;s a tribute to the very careful rules of engagement promulgated by General McChrystal and General Petraeus something that distinguishes us greatly from the way the Red Army or others have fought in Afghanistan. To win over the population, coalition forces are also working to improve governance and cut corruption.</p><p end="1184" is_meta="false" speaker="Max Boot" start="1125">A lot of the corruption in Afghanistan has been fueled by our own money. In the years when we have few troops there, we contracted out security to warlords who abused the people and drove them into the arms of the Taliban. Now that is changing. We are less reliant on warlords and General Petraeus is striving to ensure that our spending doesn&#8217;t fuel corruption. A lot of the focus today is on avoiding bottlenecks in Kabul by working in the provinces where the troops are assisted by a civilian surge with the number of civilian U.S. government employees there having gone up three times in the past year,</p><p end="1184" is_meta="false" speaker="Max Boot" start="1125">three fold. Perhaps the most important line of operations is the training of Afghan security forces, the ANSF. That&#8217;s our ticket out of Afghanistan. As they stand up, we can draw down responsibly as we&#8217;ve done in Iraq. We don&#8217;t need to stay until Afghanistan is as peaceful as Switzerland, only until it can be secured by its own troops.</p><p end="1184" is_meta="false" speaker="Max Boot" start="1125">And how is the ANSF training going? Well let me quote you again from The New York Times on October 12.</p><p end="1244" is_meta="false" speaker="Max Boot" start="1184">Which said that &#8220;Long a lagging priority, the plan to produce many more trained Afghan troops is moving this fall at a rapid pace. ANSF numbers have jumped from 137,000 in 2008 to 258,000 today and their quality is higher because of smaller class sizes and more intensive mentoring. Salaries are up, desertion rates are down.&#8221; Now I don&#8217;t want to over-estimate the progress that has occurred or under-estimate the problems that remain.</p><p end="1244" is_meta="false" speaker="Max Boot" start="1184">There is no doubt that we face a long, hard fight. But the biggest thing we have on our side is public opinion. My colleague Peter Bergen will tell you more about this. But the fact is the Afghans have experienced Taliban rule and they didn&#8217;t like it. Fewer than 10 percent say they want a return to the Taliban. More than 60 percent support the NATO troop presence. Again, John, this is not the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan. We have the people on our side. Is Afghanistan a lost cause?</p><p end="1304" is_meta="false" speaker="Max Boot" start="1244">President Obama doesn&#8217;t think so. Otherwise he wouldn&#8217;t have sent more than 50,000 additional troops there. General Petraeus doesn&#8217;t think so. Otherwise he wouldn&#8217;t have accepted a command that could tarnish his sterling legacy. We don&#8217;t think so either. I look forward to hearing from our opponents to see how they can possibly prove otherwise. Thank you.</p><p end="1362" is_meta="false" speaker="Nir Rosen" start="1304">Manoo whizhna [spelled phonetically] means don&#8217;t kill me.</p><p end="1362" is_meta="false" speaker="Nir Rosen" start="1304">Max said that our goal in Afghanistan is to make sure it&#8217;s a terrorist safe haven-free country. In a sense, we did that. In 2001 and 2002, we got rid of al-Qaeda in Afghanistan. So I'm not sure why we're still there. He also said that Iraq was worse than Afghanistan during the civil war. That's true. And Iraq is still worse than Afghanistan today. So where is our success in Iraq? You have more civilians being killed in Iraq today than you do in Afghanistan today. This is after the surge. Now, people like to forget about Iraq, and the media has certainly forgotten about it. But I think we can't understand what's happening in Afghanistan and what the Americans think they're doing in Afghanistan without understanding what really happened in Iraq. The surge is this narrative that things were going badly.</p><p end="1426" is_meta="false" speaker="Nir Rosen" start="1362">You have the 2006 Samarra shrine incident where the shrine was blown up, the civil war broke out. And then this genius general called David Petraeus came up with a new way of fighting a war, and that solved the problem. None of that is really true. Robert also mentioned that Petraeus wrote the counterinsurgency manual. That's not really true,</p><p end="1426" is_meta="false" speaker="Nir Rosen" start="1362">either. He signed his name at the bottom of it, but he actually had hundreds of other people involved in the process and probably corrected a few spelling mistakes. But you have all kind of academics and officers involved in that process.</p><p end="1426" is_meta="false" speaker="Nir Rosen" start="1362">Now, the civil war in Iraq, the people that won the civil war weren't the American forces.</p><p end="1426" is_meta="false" speaker="Nir Rosen" start="1362">It was Black and Decker. What do I mean by that, whenever you find a corpse in Iraq that was beheaded, you knew it was killed by a Sunni militiaman. If you find the corpse with Black and Decker power drill marks in it, Shia militiamen killed it. And what defeated the Sunni insurgency in Iraq was not the American surge. It was Shiamilitiamen in collaboration with the Iraqi police and the Iraqi army who brutally crushed the Sunni population,</p><p end="1485" is_meta="false" speaker="Nir Rosen" start="1426">Not just with power drills, but also with executions and rape with full knowledge of the Americans.</p><p end="1485" is_meta="false" speaker="Nir Rosen" start="1426">There was a Shia colonel in west Baghdad called Sabah [spelled phonetically], an army criminal who used to kidnap men, Sunni men, and then force their wives to have sex with them in order to release these men. Beginning in 2006, this was about six months before Petraeus came into Iraq, I began to meet Iraqi resistance leaders in Baghdad, in Syria, in Jordan. And suddenly, they were saying, &#8220;We lost, we lost.&#8221; And why did they lose?</p><p end="1485" is_meta="false" speaker="Nir Rosen" start="1426">Because the Shia had depopulated Sunni areas brutally, a sort of brutality that the Americans could never use. So we were killing innocent civilians but not in these rates.</p><p end="1485" is_meta="false" speaker="Nir Rosen" start="1426">At the same time, you had a total separation of Sunni and Shia civilians thanks to the civil war. One side won the civil war, the Shias, one side lost, the Sunnis. And Sunni neighborhoods in Baghdad became, very often, virtual ghost towns. This is all six months before the surge started. And I was just in Iraq about a month ago.</p><p end="1548" is_meta="false" speaker="Nir Rosen" start="1485">I was at Diyala province, where in July 2007, seven months after the surge began,</p><p end="1548" is_meta="false" speaker="Nir Rosen" start="1485">hundreds of villages were destroyed. Al-Qaeda guys would come in there and total [unintelligible] the village, blow up all the houses, slaughter the men, likewise Shia militiamen were doing the same thing to Sunni villages.</p><p end="1548" is_meta="false" speaker="Nir Rosen" start="1485">Seven months after the surge, violence was still peaking. What changed, apart from the Sunni realization that they lost was the Shia cease fire. The Shia militiamen, the Mahdi army declared a ceasefire, and violence dropped significantly after that. At the same time, you had a government that actually had some legitimacy because they would, a year later, go after the Shia militiamen, totally destroying them as well.</p><p end="1548" is_meta="false" speaker="Nir Rosen" start="1485">Now, none of the factors that helped reduce violence in Iraq to the terrible levels where they are today, still worse than Afghanistan, none of these factors even exist in Afghanistan. First of all, the Sunnis in Iraq who dominated the insurgency, were 20 percent of the population. And they were destroyed and brutalized and turned into refugees in Syria and Jordan and elsewhere. The insurgency is Afghanistan is dominated by Pashtuns, 38 to 40 percent of the population, the largest group in Afghanistan.</p><p end="1603" is_meta="false" speaker="Nir Rosen" start="1548">And they are not being brutalized. The Taliban is not a Pashtun movement, but it's dominated by Pashtuns. And they feel like they're on the rise. They have the momentum. They are spreading not only in Pashtun areas, but even in the north, amongnon-Pastuns, among Tajiks and Turkmen and Uzbeks, they&#8217;re reactivating old networks from the Taliban era. They feel like they&#8217;re doing quite well. Likewise, Baghdad was the prize in the civil war in Iraq. It was the dense, urban areas. The Americans could take each neighborhood in Baghdad and build immense walls around them, and really control the population. In Afghanistan it&#8217;s a rural insurgency. We might be focusing on the cities Kandahar, Kabul, Lashkar Gah--the Russians did the same thing. Most of the population of Afghanistan is in the villages. The Taliban are in the villages, just like the Mujahideen in the '80s were in the villages. We're making the same mistakes that the Russians were making, trying to control the cities and thinking that somehow we'll defeat the Mujahideen and the Taliban who are in the rural areas.</p><p end="1671" is_meta="false" speaker="Nir Rosen" start="1603">Now, in Iraq, we had a government that somehow had some legitimacy. They represented the majority of the people. They crushed the Shia militias. In Afghanistan --</p><p end="1671" is_meta="false" speaker="Nir Rosen" start="1603">a key element in American counterinsurgency thinking is that you have to build the capacity of the government so it can spread its power and control the population. But in Afghanistan, the government is the problem. It's predatory, it's corrupt. It's lacking any credibility. It&#8217;s the best recruiter for the Taliban. So the last thing we want to do is ally ourselves and tie ourselves to this Afghan government which is hated by most of the population. The police, when they're not doing drugs, the Afghan police are stealing from stores, are demanding taxes at checkpoints. The Afghan army, I was with the Americans in the surge of 2009. The Afghan army didn't show up. They're [unintelligible] Afghan police. This time in Kandahar, the Afghan army didn't show up again. We've spent billions on the Afghan army. We, as taxpayers should be upset about this. And who's fighting on our side in Kandahar today? It's not the Afghan army. It is Colonel Raziq from the border police, a brutal warlord who brutalized the population of Kandahar a few years ago and turned many people, such as the Noorzai clan, against the U.S. and joined the Taliban.</p><p end="1726" is_meta="false" speaker="Nir Rosen" start="1671">We've gone back to the same guy, Colonel Raziq, not the army, recruited a warlord.</p><p end="1726" is_meta="false" speaker="Nir Rosen" start="1671">Where is the Afghan army? They just decided not to show up. We don't know what happened to our billions of dollars. So you don't have a government with any legitimacy or any prospect of legitimacy. You don't have any sign that you're defeating the insurgency or that you're punishing the population. In fact, there's only one counterinsurgency campaign that's ever worked in history. That was the British in Malaya. And why did that work? The British basically took half a million ethnic Chinese, put them in concentration camps and took them away from their homes. So,</p><p end="1726" is_meta="false" speaker="Nir Rosen" start="1671">sure, we can do that in Afghanistan. We could defeat the Taliban. We could massively depopulate Pashtun areas and be genocidal about it. Short of that, there's just no evidence to date that we can do anything better. Nine years into this, every year, things have gotten worse and worse. This year is the worst year so far. Next year is guaranteed to be worse. The violence is spreading. Taliban control about 80 percent of the country right now.</p><p end="1786" is_meta="false" speaker="Nir Rosen" start="1726">We are hated. In my travels, I was shocked -- I was in Afghanistan last January and February. And I was shocked to see that school teachers, local government officials, bus drivers were all complaining to me about the Americans and their night raids and their operations killing civilians. I don't think the American people know the extent to which the Afghans resent their presence or feel humiliated by it.</p><p end="1786" is_meta="false" speaker="Nir Rosen" start="1726">All right. Thanks.</p><p end="1786" is_meta="false" speaker="Peter Bergen" start="1726">No sense of humor. He's not a barrel of laughs. He's not a funny guy.</p><p end="1842" is_meta="false" speaker="Peter Bergen" start="1786">First I want to salute the service of Matthew Hoh both in Afghanistan and Iraq. And I want to salute Nir Rosen's brave and enterprising reporting. It's very good to be on this stage with them and my colleague Max. And let's remind -- Max at the beginning said what this motion was about. This motion is not about Afghanistan is kind of not going well. This motion is not about we're kind of not doing so well. We're sort of losing.</p><p end="1842" is_meta="false" speaker="Peter Bergen" start="1786">This is -- the motion is about Afghanistan is a lost cause. Now, that is a pretty high bar that they have to prove. And so far we've heard a lot about Iraq, not much aboutAfghanistan, and some pretty easy to disprove assertions that they've made when they talked about Afghanistan. And some things that they didn't even talk about, I'm surprised. You know, the graveyard of empires cliche, for instance. They didn't bring this up. Well, turns out that many empires have gone into Afghanistan and done pretty well.</p><p end="1904" is_meta="false" speaker="Peter Bergen" start="1842">The only empire that didn't do well there was the Soviets for the very good reason that they, as my colleague Max point out, they killed a million Afghans, made 5 million of them homeless. A successful counterinsurgency operation is exactly what we're doing and what the Soviets did not do. Rather, the small numbers of Afghan civilians are dying in this war, too many to be sure. But we're talking, instead of millions, as happened under the Soviets, hundreds. And as Max pointed out, the numbers are dropping,</p><p end="1904" is_meta="false" speaker="Peter Bergen" start="1842">particularly because of our rules of engagement.</p><p end="1904" is_meta="false" speaker="Peter Bergen" start="1842">We heard from Nir that Afghanistan is a very violent place. Well, actually, you're more likely to be murdered in my hometown of Washington, D.C. than you are to be killed in the war in Afghanistan right now. Last year, about 3,000 Afghan civilians were killed in the war, population of 30 million. But you're more likely to be murdered in the United States in 1991 just generally than you are to be killed in the war in Afghanistan right now. It is simply not that violent. In fact, my wife is sitting here. We met in Afghanistan. You can actually have quite a good time in Kabul.</p><p end="1965" is_meta="false" speaker="Peter Bergen" start="1904">It's a relatively peaceful place. There are restaurants, there are bars. You can have a regular social life, which, by the way, you could never have in Baghdad. And if you look at the murder rates in countries like Mexico, Venezuela, Columbia, and Russia, they're much, much higher than the death rate from the war in Afghanistan. We're not saying that Washington, D.C. is a lost cause. Maybe some people might say that. But we're not saying that Russia is a lost cause, we're not saying that Columbia is a lost cause, we're not saying that Mexico is a lost cause, we're not saying Venezuela is a lost cause, yet our opponents are suggesting it's a lost cause. And this is ridiculous. Another thing we've heard, of course, if the Karzai government is corrupt, and inefficient, and incompetent,</p><p end="1965" is_meta="false" speaker="Peter Bergen" start="1904">sure, no doubt, but let's look at the neighborhood. To his west he has Iran with Ahmadinejad, who's a Holocaust denier. We don't need to say much more about him. To his north he has Karimov, of Uzbekistan, who boils people alive as a sort of forensic technique. To his west we have the military dictatorship on and off of Pakistan, Asif Ali Zardari, the President, who's Mr. 10 percent because he takes at least 10 percent of everything.</p><p end="2022" is_meta="false" speaker="Peter Bergen" start="1965">And so if you look at the neighborhood he's in, this is -- Karzai is looking pretty good.</p><p end="2022" is_meta="false" speaker="Peter Bergen" start="1965">And he actually won at the most recent election. Sure, it wasn't the fairest election in history.</p><p end="2022" is_meta="true" speaker="Peter Bergen" start="1965">laughter</p><p end="2022" is_meta="false" speaker="Peter Bergen" start="1965">But he's winning elections. I mean, this is a democracy. Look at the neighborhood.</p><p end="2022" is_meta="false" speaker="Peter Bergen" start="1965">And, in fact, Freedom House, which looks at political freedoms around the world, judges that Afghanistan is about as free as any of the immediate neighbors. And look at Afghan history, think about Karzai's predecessor for a second, the warlords, the Taliban,</p><p end="2022" is_meta="false" speaker="Peter Bergen" start="1965">Najibullah, the Communist dictator, and, of course, the Soviets. By that standard, both regionally and historically, Karzai is looking pretty good. One of the weakest arguments that our opponents didn't even bring up is that foreign forces in Afghanistan are always antibodies. Well, Nir did say that we're hated. BBC, hardly pro-American, generally speaking, news organization, found that 68 percent of Afghans last year had a favorable view of the U.S. military.</p><p end="2085" is_meta="false" speaker="Peter Bergen" start="2022">Well, you probably can't find 68 percent of the inhabitants of the upper west side who have a favorable view of the U.S. military.</p><p end="2085" is_meta="true" speaker="Peter Bergen" start="2022">laughter</p><p end="2085" is_meta="false" speaker="Peter Bergen" start="2022">And yet the Afghans do, and that number used to be 85 percent. Sure, we're losing some of our popularity, but we are still liked. They don't want us to go. They want us to perform on the promises that we seem to have given them early on that we would bring a more relatively prosperous and stable place. And since at the heart of a counterinsurgency is the views of the population, the population is very much on our side. Matthew mentioned that we can't afford this war. Well, we're spending $100 billion on the war.</p><p end="2085" is_meta="false" speaker="Peter Bergen" start="2022">That's one percent of GDP. Between Vietnam we spent 10 percent of our GDP on the war. And I think this money's well-spent. First off, the numbers are going to go down as we spend less money and we have fewer troops. Secondly, just -- we were sitting in New York, and my wife and I just toured the Trade Center site this morning, and, you know,</p><p end="2085" is_meta="false" speaker="Peter Bergen" start="2022">that cost 3,000 American lives, and it cost $500 billion, and it [unclear] affects the American economy, five percent of our GDP, had a devastating effect on so many of us in this room.</p><p end="2147" is_meta="false" speaker="Peter Bergen" start="2085">And, you know, to make sure that al-Qaeda cannot come back to Afghanistan is money very, very well-spent, and the idea that the Taliban and al-Qaeda are not somehow allied is ridiculous. Anybody in this room who recalls the May, 2010, attempt in Times Square by a guy called Faisal Shahzad to blow up an SUV to kill dozens of people on a Saturday night at 6:00, luckily it didn't work out, well, he came from the Pakistani Taliban, which is a group that has been infected ideologically by al-Qaeda. And the fact that al-Qaeda isa relatively small group doesn&#8217;t mean very much at all because on 9/11 al-Qaeda only consisted of 200 people. And yet it did all this damage to us. What the problem with al-</p><p end="2147" is_meta="false" speaker="Peter Bergen" start="2085">Qaeda is, is its ability to reinfect ideologically other groups, and the Taliban is one of them. And let's also accentuate the positive for a second. There are millions of Afghans back in school, of course, many of them girls, one in six Afghans have cell phones,</p><p end="2147" is_meta="false" speaker="Peter Bergen" start="2085">perhaps as sort of a debatable form of progress, but one nonetheless in the sense where in a country that didn&#8217;t have a phone system at all.</p><p end="2203" is_meta="false" speaker="Peter Bergen" start="2147">Their GDP growth rate in Afghanistan in 2007 was 14 percent. It&#8217;s gone down just as every other economy has recently. Former Afghan refugees returned home. Refugees do not return to places they don&#8217;t think have a future. And so there are many positive indicators about what&#8217;s going on. And let me give you -- there&#8217;s a very common polling question is: Do you have a positive view of the future? And, now, when Americans were asked that in the closing days of the Bush administration, only 17 percent of Americans said, "I have a positive view of the future." Understandable, why? The country was in the worst depression since the Great Depression. Well, when Afghans were asked this just recently, 70 percent of them said, "I have a favorable view of the future." And that&#8217;s because they&#8217;ve lived through the Taliban. I was there under the Taliban. I was there during the Civil War. What is going on now is obviously better than what happened before. And Afghans don&#8217;t think their countries are a lost cause, so why should we think that?</p><p end="2203" is_meta="true" speaker="Peter Bergen" start="2147">applause</p><p end="2325" is_meta="false" speaker="Nir Rosen" start="2267">To cynics [unclear] I think it doesn&#8217;t even matter because we never went there for the Afghan people. Afghanistan was never a cause for us. This was purely a security issue.</p><p end="2325" is_meta="false" speaker="Nir Rosen" start="2267">But in my experience, polls in Afghanistan are notoriously unreliable because people focus on cities, on urban people who have more money and have a vested interest in the Americans staying there. But when you travel the countryside as I have, as many of the journalists have, you find an intense amount of resentment and hatred by people you wouldn&#8217;t expect to hear it from. That&#8217;s because of our night raids, many of our operations. Sure, we&#8217;re not as brutal as the Russians were. But we&#8217;re dropping bombs on weddings. Our Special Forces are going on raids and they&#8217;re killing innocent civilians.</p><p end="2384" is_meta="false" speaker="Nir Rosen" start="2325">Many innocent Afghans are dying as a result of our operations. Our operations are disrupting normal activity. Bus drivers were complaining to me, the guys who do the routes from Kabul to the south and Kabul to Herat, about how brutal the Americans are.</p><p end="2384" is_meta="false" speaker="Nir Rosen" start="2325">[unintelligible] Tajiks [unintelligible] our nominal allies, Americans are enemies of Islam.</p><p end="2384" is_meta="false" speaker="Max Boot" start="2325">It absolutely does matter.</p><p end="2443" is_meta="false" speaker="Max Boot" start="2384">You know, there&#8217;s always questions about the reliability of opinion polls not only in Afghanistan but here.</p><p end="2443" is_meta="false" speaker="Max Boot" start="2384">There&#8217;s no question.</p><p end="2501" is_meta="false" speaker="Max Boot" start="2443">But the polls have been pretty consistent over a number of years and they comport with what I and many other people find out for ourselves by talking to ordinary Afghans which is that there is not an overwhelming resentment of foreigners. What there is is resentment of the fact that the foreigners have come and have not done a better job of defeating the Taliban whom they hate.</p><p end="2501" is_meta="false" speaker="Nir Rosen" start="2443">I don&#8217;t think you talked to ordinary Afghans. You go on these babysitting tours where the U.S. military protects you, white guys with guns who take you around the country andit&#8217;s all choreographed and staged. It&#8217;s not really like you&#8217;ve been in Afghanistan. It&#8217;s all organized and staged and the Afghans aren&#8217;t going to interact with you the same way when you&#8217;re the occupier, the Christian occupier with the M-16 next to you as opposed to going into villages and talking to common people.</p><p end="2501" is_meta="false" speaker="Peter Bergen" start="2443">Okay, well, criticizing Max --</p><p end="2501" is_meta="false" speaker="Peter Bergen" start="2443">I mean, let&#8217;s get back to the real point. Anecdotes about what I talked about this Afghan or that Afghan. I&#8217;ve been visiting Afghanistan since &#8217;93. I was there during the civil war.</p><p end="2501" is_meta="false" speaker="Peter Bergen" start="2443">The Afghans destroyed Kabul. It wasn&#8217;t the Soviets. Hundreds of thousands of people died. Then the Taliban came.</p><p end="2569" is_meta="false" speaker="Peter Bergen" start="2501">They were the most brutal and incompetent regime. As Max has pointed out there&#8217;s nothing quite like living under the Taliban for not having a nostalgia about their wonderful rule. Only seven percent of Afghans have a favorable view. These opinion polls, they are scientific opinion polls. They&#8217;re conducted by major news organizations,</p><p end="2569" is_meta="false" speaker="Peter Bergen" start="2501">the BBC, ABC News, German television, the Asia Foundation. These are not amateurs.</p><p end="2569" is_meta="false" speaker="Peter Bergen" start="2501">These are as good as polls that come out in this country. There may be some -- there's always several percentage points. But in general, you know that the trend is pro American, pro-NATO, anti-Taliban.</p><p end="2625" is_meta="false" speaker="Matthew Hoh" start="2569">The main thing is our troops aren't fighting al-Qaeda. They're fighting Taliban. They're fighting people who are upset that we're occupying their villages and valleys. The U.S.</p><p end="2625" is_meta="false" speaker="Matthew Hoh" start="2569">intelligence community will cite -- you can look at the Boston globe from September 2009, that nine out of ten members of the Taliban are members of the Taliban because of foreign occupation and because of an ongoing civil war. I actually support Peter and Max's polls. 60 percent or 68 percent of Afghans are for our presence. 32 percent are violently opposed to the point they'll take up rifles. This -- Afghanistan is not a homogenous society. It's a regionalized, localized society with many, many differentethnic schisms, regional schisms. There are Hatfield and McCoy type situations that our troops are finding themselves in the middle every day. And remember, this war goes back to the '70s. The reason the Soviet Union intervened in Afghanistan was because the country was already at war.</p><p end="2684" is_meta="false" speaker="Matthew Hoh" start="2625">So we -- in 2001, when we intervened, the country was at civil war. We took one side out of power and put the other side in power, but we didn't address those underlying root causes of the conflict.</p><p end="2684" is_meta="false" speaker="Matthew Hoh" start="2625">Now, getting back to the polling data, again, I support that. You probably have about a 60/40 split in the country. I'll also say that some of the things -- you've got to look at the polling data real well because, yes, 7 percent of the population supports the Taliban.</p><p end="2684" is_meta="false" speaker="Matthew Hoh" start="2625">However, in the Asia Foundation poll that was just cited, 80 percent of the population supported talking to the Taliban and negotiating with them. Here is the deal, if you are given a choice, if you are a rural Pashtun villager, and you are given a choice between the Taliban who are ethnically and culturally similar to you or the Karzai government which is made of up non-rural Pashtuns, outsiders who are corrupt and who are backed up by an invading and occupying army, which are you going to choose?</p><p end="2684" is_meta="false" speaker="Matthew Hoh" start="2625">It's a bad choice.</p><p end="2744" is_meta="false" speaker="Max Boot" start="2684">Can I just -- can I take issue with a point that Matt has made several times now, which is to suggest that the Taliban are fighting essentially because we're there. That really flies in the face of history. And the fact is the Taliban movement began in the mid 1990s,</p><p end="2744" is_meta="false" speaker="Max Boot" start="2684">when there was not a single American soldier in all of Afghanistan. They were a response to the chaos to the conditions that prevailed in Afghanistan when we had no presence at all there. And they managed to take over the country after a brutal and horrifying civil war and to impose one of the most totalitarian and anti-Diluvian roles the world has ever seen in Afghanistan. So the notion that somehow the Taliban would go away or would stop fighting or would suddenly be transformed into Mother Teresa if we weren't there is really ahistorical because if we weren't there, they would take over as they did last time in the 1990s.</p><p end="2744" is_meta="false" speaker="Max Boot" start="2684">John Donvan:Nir Rosen, is that what you're saying?</p><p end="2744" is_meta="false" speaker="Nir Rosen" start="2684">Well, they'll probably take over much of the country. That's true.</p><p end="2744" is_meta="false" speaker="Max Boot" start="2684">We rest our case.</p><p end="2744" is_meta="false" speaker="Nir Rosen" start="2684">This is not the Taliban of pre-2001. This is an insurgent movement which is very clear about its goals. They are local people, local farmers who are fighting for very local reasons.</p><p end="2809" is_meta="false" speaker="Nir Rosen" start="2744">Maybe it's anti-occupation, maybe it's for Islam or for their village or for revenge or because Americans are backing one tribe against another tribe. But they are locals fighting for Afghanistan. They've always been very clear about that.</p><p end="2809" is_meta="false" speaker="Peter Bergen" start="2744">I love the fact that this is not the Taliban of 2001. This is a much worse Taliban. This is a Taliban that is more ideologically [unintelligible] with al-Qaeda. The reason that we're facing the big insurgency that we are is that they've adopted wholesale al-Qaeda's tactics from the Iraqi theater. Suicide attacks went up five times between 2005 and 2006, IED attacks. These groups are much more closely aligned. There was a public stoning by the Taliban just a few weeks ago. And so the idea that somehow the moderate Taliban are going to kind of take -- come into Afghanistan is nonsensical. The whole notion of a moderate Taliban is sort of an oxymoron. Is that the Taliban who let their girls go to school once a month or once a week? These are unreformed, and they got worse over time.</p><p end="2809" is_meta="true" speaker="Peter Bergen" start="2744">talking simultaneously</p><p end="2809" is_meta="false" speaker="Matthew Hoh" start="2744">I resent the idea that the Taliban or the opponents of the Taliban in Afghanistan are wearing white hats, is not true.</p><p end="2867" is_meta="false" speaker="Peter Bergen" start="2809">We're not suggesting that.</p><p end="2867" is_meta="false" speaker="Matthew Hoh" start="2809">Neither side are paradigms of women's rights or anything in this conflict.</p><p end="2867" is_meta="false" speaker="Matthew Hoh" start="2809">John Donvan:Nir Rosen and Matthew Hoh. You're arguing that Afghanistan is a lost cause. If Afghanistan is lost, if the Taliban takes over significant parts of Afghanistan or simply the chaos continues in Afghanistan is that a threat to American national security?</p><p end="2867" is_meta="false" speaker="Nir Rosen" start="2809">The Taliban, with their pickup trucks and AK-47s are no threat to the US. Al-Qaeda is not in Afghanistan. They were defeated. They're in Pakistan. They're in Yemen.</p><p end="2867" is_meta="false" speaker="Nir Rosen" start="2809">They're in internet cafes and slums around the world. The Taliban leadership is composed of Afghans. Al-Qaeda which is based now in Pakistan, to the extent that it exists as a real organization is led by Arabs and Pakistanis. In all the Taliban statements,</p><p end="2867" is_meta="false" speaker="Nir Rosen" start="2809">the Afghan Taliban, not the Pakistani Taliban, two very different organizations, the Afghan Taliban speaks very much about their goals in Afghanistan. Peter conflated the two. It's true --</p><p end="2924" is_meta="false" speaker="Nir Rosen" start="2867">As far as ours, absolutely.</p><p end="2924" is_meta="true" speaker="Nir Rosen" start="2867">talking simultaneously</p><p end="2924" is_meta="false" speaker="Matthew Hoh" start="2867">We&#8217;re not advocating us leaving.</p><p end="2924" is_meta="false" speaker="Max Boot" start="2867">Can I cite a differing opinion here from an article that I consider fairly authoritative on this matter. It says the Taliban, once an isolated and impoverished group of religious students who knew little about the rest of the world and cared only about liberating their country from oppressive warlords are now among the best armed and most experienced insurgents in the world linked to a global movement of jihadists that stretches from Pakistan and Iraq to Chechnya and the Philippines. Now, the author of that article, which ran in &#8220;Rolling Stone,&#8221; in 2008, called &#8220;How We Lost the War We Won,&#8221; was a fellow named Nir Rosen. I don't know if you might be related to the gentleman sitting on the other side of the stage here.</p><p end="2924" is_meta="false" speaker="Nir Rosen" start="2867">There is a marriage of convenience, of course there's some cooperation, although we don't see it very much. When you visit villages, as most journalists who have met Taliban will say, they are local fighters. They raise money locally.</p><p end="2984" is_meta="false" speaker="Nir Rosen" start="2924">They're not fighting more money, by the way. They're fighting for very local reasons.</p><p end="2984" is_meta="false" speaker="Nir Rosen" start="2924">And you don't really see many Arabs among them. When you speak to them, as I have,</p><p end="2984" is_meta="false" speaker="Nir Rosen" start="2924">and other journalists have, they will often criticize the Arabs and non-Pashtuns among them, and they also condemn suicide bombing as well. But sure, they do use suicide bombers. It's not an al-Qaeda tactic. This is an insurgency tactic. It's not so much a question of ideology.</p><p end="2984" is_meta="false" speaker="Peter Bergen" start="2924">Of course, it would be. It would be a moral catastrophe to allow the Taliban to take over and impose a regime on Afghans. We overthrew their government. We have a moral responsibility to more or less --</p><p end="2984" is_meta="false" speaker="Peter Bergen" start="2924">-- more or less get it right. Well, we already know, when the Taliban was in charge of Afghanistan, al-Qaeda had free rein in the country.</p><p end="3042" is_meta="false" speaker="Peter Bergen" start="2984">The Taliban, by the way, have had ten years to say 9/11 was a bad idea, al-Qaeda is a bad idea. Osama Bin Laden really was kind of a problem for us. They've never said that.</p><p end="3042" is_meta="false" speaker="Peter Bergen" start="2984">They never -- one of the central -- if there are negotiations with the Taliban, you know,</p><p end="3042" is_meta="false" speaker="Peter Bergen" start="2984">one of the things they've got to do is reject al-Qaeda. They've never done that. And in fact as we've seen in Times Square that these groups are very closely aligned.</p><p end="3042" is_meta="false" speaker="Nir Rosen" start="2984">Pakistani Taliban, though. It's dishonest to compare the Afghan Taliban with the Pakistani Taliban.</p><p end="3042" is_meta="false" speaker="Peter Bergen" start="2984">It's the Taliban. They're all based in Pakistan right now because we thankfully got a lot of them out of Afghanistan. And if we got out of Afghanistan, they would all come back to Afghanistan. They're only in Pakistan because we are forcing them out. And whatwe're trying to prevent is a safe haven in Afghanistan coming back for al-Qaeda and the Taliban who just moved across the border. We can't invade Pakistan.</p><p end="3042" is_meta="false" speaker="Matthew Hoh" start="2984">You know, two things, one, I don't think al-Qaeda needs a safe haven and wants a safe haven. I'd like them to go back into safe haven. I'd love for them to open [unclear] farms back in Kandahar because then we could bomb them.</p><p end="3107" is_meta="false" speaker="Matthew Hoh" start="3042">They do not operate in any manner that we're going to -- they don't operate in a manner that we can attack with conventional forces. Again, look at the history of attacks in the last ten years. I urge you to go to the Heritage Foundation website, the Heritage Foundation, not a limp-wristed, left-leaning organization by any means. And you'll see that they documented the 30 attacks against the United States by transnational terror groups, primarily by al-Qaeda, for the last ten years. And you'll see it's all done by individuals in small cells who don't require large safe havens. Since 2001 al-Qaeda has evolved into an organization that is decentralized, it's near virtual, and it does not exist in a manner that we can attack. And actually the RAND corporation did a study two years ago. And it found that 84 percent of all terrorist groups since the '60s have met their end by either police action, by intelligence action or by political action. So the smart way to go about them is to attack al-Qaeda as they actually exist and not as we want them to be or not how they were 10 years ago.</p><p end="3165" is_meta="false" speaker="Matthew Hoh" start="3107">They're an organization like any other organization. They evolve. Organizations tend not to devolve. It does not make any sense why al-Qaeda would want to go to a place or go back into a form where they could be readily attacked by our aircraft, our cruise missiles, our commandos. And like I said, if they did, that's great, because then we could go after them that way.</p><p end="3222" is_meta="false" speaker="Max Boot" start="3165">Well, John, the fact is we don't have perfect allies in Afghanistan, but that's true in any counterinsurgency fight because think about it, the reason why you have an insurgency in the first place is because the government isn't doing a very good job. And if the government were doing a wonderful job, you would not have an insurgency. Despite that, however, most insurgencies fail.</p><p end="3282" is_meta="false" speaker="Max Boot" start="3222">The research I've done for this book on the history of guerilla warfare suggests that more than 65 percent of all counterinsurgency efforts have been successful over the last 200 years whereas insurgents have achieved their objectives only about 20 percent of the time. That means in more than 65 percent of cases, it has been possible to increase government capacity to not only militarily defeat the insurgency, but also to take away some of the reasons why they're able to recruit in the first place. And that is something that we are working very hard to do in the case of Afghanistan. And there is no question that the Afghan government has many imperfections, that it has corruption, it is ineffective, it has a lot of other problems, but, again, on the other side, you are not exactly facing -- you're not exactly facing the League of Women Voters. You are facing an intensely unpopular group which has far more problems, and which is far more brutal, far more implicated in the drug trade, the people of Afghanistan have experienced the rule of both the Taliban and the current government. They know the current government has problems.</p><p end="3345" is_meta="false" speaker="Max Boot" start="3282">But, again, to refer to those polls which marry up with everything I've learned in my trips to Afghanistan, over 90 percent of Afghans prefer the current government to the Taliban,</p><p end="3345" is_meta="false" speaker="Max Boot" start="3282">and that's the underlying reality which will make it possible for us to prevail.</p><p end="3345" is_meta="false" speaker="Max Boot" start="3282">Well, there's no question that Nir has embedded with the Taliban and I haven&#8217;t, so hats off to him. But I&#8217;m not sure that necessarily embedding with the Taliban gives you a rounded view of what the people of Afghanistan think either. And, in fact, the reality is most of the Afghans are not part of the Taliban. Most of them abhor the Taliban. And,</p><p end="3345" is_meta="false" speaker="Max Boot" start="3282">again, you don&#8217;t have to take my word for it, you don&#8217;t have to take the word of the pollsters for it, all you have to do is look at the number of Afghans who have -- as I mentioned before, who have actually taken up arms against the government.</p><p end="3406" is_meta="false" speaker="Max Boot" start="3345">It&#8217;s a miniscule portion of the number that took up arms against the Soviets in the 1980s who were genuinely detested by the entire population.</p><p end="3406" is_meta="false" speaker="Nir Rosen" start="3345">More is the problem, the more troops we put in there, the more money we&#8217;ve put in,</p><p end="3406" is_meta="false" speaker="Nir Rosen" start="3345">we&#8217;ve actually created a conflict because of our money. Iraq's people are fighting over control of the oil. In Afghanistan the only resource is American money. You have warlords that we&#8217;re backing competing for American money, you have the Taliban who are making money from our presence there, you have Afghan police who are selling the bullets we are giving them to the Taliban, you have contractors where the Americans are paying who are paying bribes to the Taliban.</p><p end="3462" is_meta="false" speaker="Nir Rosen" start="3406">It&#8217;s all about American money, the more we put in there, the more of our presence, the more supplies it requires, the more warlords we&#8217;re paying to protect our convoys. In Iraq we were using American mercenary companies. In Afghanistan we're using Afghan warlords.</p><p end="3462" is_meta="false" speaker="Peter Bergen" start="3406">I think quite the reverse, the less we did, the worse it got. If you look -- go back to 2003,</p><p end="3462" is_meta="false" speaker="Peter Bergen" start="3406">there were 6,000 American soldiers in Afghanistan. That&#8217;s the size of the police department of Houston in a country the size of Texas with a population 10 times larger.</p><p end="3462" is_meta="false" speaker="Peter Bergen" start="3406">It was precisely because of the Bush administration&#8217;s ideological opposition to nation building that we did everything on the cheap and we got what we paid for. Into the vacuum of governance and authority stepped the Taliban and al Qaeda and actually this raises a very good point which is it would be much more convincing to say that look, we should just sort of wash our hands of Afghanistan if we hadn&#8217;t already done it twice.</p><p end="3523" is_meta="false" speaker="Peter Bergen" start="3462">In 1989 we closed our embassy there after arming the mujahideen and defeating the Soviets. The Clinton administration then zeroed out aid to one of the poorest countries in the world and into that vacuum stepped the Taliban and al Qaeda. Then in 2001, the Bush administration did almost exactly the same thing. So it&#8217;s not because we&#8217;ve done too much. It&#8217;s because we&#8217;ve done too little. We&#8217;re finally beginning to -- we&#8217;re in year one of a serious effort. Up to this point, we&#8217;ve really done not enough and if you go back to some of our other peace keeping operations, in Bosnia we spent 20 times per capita what we&#8217;re spending in Afghanistan in the first years of occupation; in Kosovo, much,</p><p end="3523" is_meta="false" speaker="Peter Bergen" start="3462">much larger. According to the Rand Corporation, this was the least resourced nation building effort the United States has engaged in since World War II.</p><p end="3523" is_meta="false" speaker="Matthew Hoh" start="3462">We did. When we got there in 2001 we were welcomed. People didn&#8217;t like the Taliban.</p><p end="3523" is_meta="false" speaker="Matthew Hoh" start="3462">They didn&#8217;t receive their support. They fled to Pakistan. We stayed and supported a clique that was the government. The government was exclusionary.</p><p end="3583" is_meta="false" speaker="Matthew Hoh" start="3523">And so what you had happen over time, that period from 2002 to 2005 was the American troops never left. We spent a lot of money there that went to enrich a few people and we supported and propped up a corrupt and illegitimate government that was exclusionary.</p><p end="3583" is_meta="false" speaker="Matthew Hoh" start="3523">When I say exclusionary, one thing I have to say again, going back to Afghanistan, it is a very ethnically regional and localized country. This is as if -- now we&#8217;re talking about the government -- I was embedded with the Afghan government. I ate a couple of meals with them a day. I had the parasite to prove it.</p><p end="3583" is_meta="false" speaker="Matthew Hoh" start="3523">[laughter]It&#8217;s a wonderful weight loss thing, guys. But no, in a sense it would be like after 2005 our federal government put me, a guy from Jersey, in charge of a parish in Louisiana and sent the New York National Guard to keep me in power. That&#8217;s the dynamic that you see there. And this idea about -- just to get back -- another thing about the government, the idea that we&#8217;re on the side of good and the Soviet Union was on the side of bad, again,</p><p end="3583" is_meta="false" speaker="Matthew Hoh" start="3523">the Afghans don&#8217;t see it that way.</p><p end="3644" is_meta="false" speaker="Matthew Hoh" start="3583">It&#8217;s such a confused conflict there. But I can tell you that the Afghan army brigade commander I worked with, the Afghan police commander I worked with, and the Afghan intelligence chief I worked with were all Moscow trained. They had all fought on the side of the Soviets. The Afghan army was well over 100,000 people at times. Kabul was so safe for the Soviets that Soviet administrators used to live in Kabul with their families.</p><p end="3644" is_meta="false" speaker="Matthew Hoh" start="3583">The Soviets had 20,000 civilian advisors there. So the idea that what we&#8217;re doing -- I agree with parts of what Max said about the difference between us and the Soviets but there are also similarities that really can&#8217;t be ignored.</p><p end="3885" is_meta="false" speaker="Peter Bergen" start="3821">Yeah. Pakistan has very belatedly begun to realize that the Jihadi Frankenstein that they helped create, the Taliban, has become a huge problem for them. Benazir Bhutto, the most popular politician in Pakistan was killed by the Taliban. The Taliban have attacked hundreds of police, killed hundreds of police officers and army soldiers.</p><p end="3944" is_meta="false" speaker="Peter Bergen" start="3885">And as a result, the Pakistani public, which used to view the Taliban as sort of religious Robin Hoods, now see them largely as thugs. Support for suicide bombing in Pakistan dropped from 33 percent to five percent in the last several years. And the Pakistani military have done significant military operations in Swat, which is the tourist destination in the north of Pakistan and also in southern Waziristan. And it's not perfect, but the enemy of the perfect is not the reason we okay. And the Pakistani government, military and public have already turned against the Taliban in a very sizeable way because they understand that the Taliban is now attacking the Pakistani state.</p><p end="3944" is_meta="false" speaker="Nir Rosen" start="3885">There's a very dangerous conflation here, though, because there's the Pakistani Taliban and Afghan Taliban. It's true, the Pakistani state is fighting brutally the Pakistani Taliban. It's not fighting the Afghan Taliban. It's supporting the Afghan Taliban. In fact, the Afghan Taliban has criticized the Pakistani Taliban for fighting the Pakistanistate and told them they should come to Afghanistan to fight the Americans in Afghanistan. But I think it's not only important to look at what the Pakistanis are doing to Afghanistan and to us --</p><p end="4003" is_meta="false" speaker="Nir Rosen" start="3944">-- it's important to look at what we're doing to the Pakistanis. We've driven -- Pakistan is a much more crucial country, with nuclear weapons, conflict with India. We have driven the Taliban into Pakistan. We've driven al-Qaeda into Pakistan. And our drone strikes now are not only pushing the Taliban and al-Qaeda into Pakistan, but further into Karachi into Sindh, Punjab. We are destabilizing Pakistan, a much more important and dangerous country. Just by being in Afghanistan, we're also pushing drug networks out of Afghanistan into Pakistan. It's our presence which is threatening this crucial country,</p><p end="4003" is_meta="false" speaker="Nir Rosen" start="3944">which, of course, can go into conflict with India, et cetera.</p><p end="4003" is_meta="false" speaker="Max Boot" start="3944">Can I ask a question here? I mean, what is -- what is more likely to produce a stable and pro Western Pakistan in the future? Is it an American defeat in Afghanistan? Is it a withdrawal that will be hailed by the jihadists as a glorious victory against another super power, one that will allow their allies and the Taliban to take power in Afghanistan? Is that going to be good for the future of Pakistan? Or conversely, what about the future --</p><p end="4064" is_meta="false" speaker="Max Boot" start="4003">-- of Pakistan if we are in fact able to stabilize Afghanistan to shore up the friendly pro-</p><p end="4064" is_meta="false" speaker="Max Boot" start="4003">Western government there which works with the West to fight terrorism? What is the impact of that going to be on Pakistan. I think my point is -- should be pretty clear,</p><p end="4064" is_meta="false" speaker="Max Boot" start="4003">which is that if we are concerned about the future of Pakistan -- and I certainly am -- then running out of Afghanistan is not the strategy to pursue. That will in fact weaken the government of Pakistan and destabilize it, whereas if we can stabilize Afghanistan, that will do much to strengthen the forces of moderation in Pakistan.</p><p end="4064" is_meta="true" speaker="Max Boot" start="4003">talking simultaneously</p><p end="4064" is_meta="false" speaker="Matthew Hoh" start="4003">[unintelligible], John. Just to answer that real quick?</p><p end="4064" is_meta="false" speaker="Matthew Hoh" start="4003">Two things: One, does al-Qaeda receive more recruits because we occupy two Muslim countries or because of a supposed loss in Afghanistan? And also, too, we're not talkingabout losing or running from Afghanistan. We're talking about getting a political process that resolves 30 years of conflict in Afghanistan. In 2000 -- go into Pakistan. In 2001,</p><p end="4064" is_meta="false" speaker="Matthew Hoh" start="4003">Pakistan had two insurgencies.</p><p end="4123" is_meta="false" speaker="Matthew Hoh" start="4064">They had insurgency in Sindh and an insurgency in Balochistan. They didn't have insurgency in the Pashtun areas. There were extremist groups there, but there was not an insurgency. The Pakistani Taliban did not come into existence until 2006 or 2007 and had popular support from the Pashtun people until we had the Islamabad government send the army into there, which hadn't occurred for 40, 50 years, and until our drones start showing up. So if anything, if you look at what's happened to Pakistan in the last 10 years, our presence and our continued escalation of Afghanistan, that has destabilized Pakistan. So, again, we&#8217;re not talking about cutting and running from Afghanistan.</p><p end="4123" is_meta="false" speaker="Matthew Hoh" start="4064">We're talking about having a political process that ends 30 years of war that stabilizes not just Afghanistan but Pakistan as well.</p><p end="4183" is_meta="false" speaker="Peter Bergen" start="4123">Three weeks ago, an expert on Afghanistan discussed this very topic. And he said that --</p><p end="4183" is_meta="false" speaker="Peter Bergen" start="4123">talking about the --</p><p end="4241" is_meta="false" speaker="Peter Bergen" start="4183">-- peace negotiations with the Taliban, he said reports of the U.S. being involved with efforts to reconcile elements of the insurgency with the Karzai government are reports that provide hope, albeit cautious hope that a more sensible and rational U.S. policy is taking hold. The same expert also said that he had cautious optimism for Afghanistan as a result of these talks. That expert was Matthew Hoh. Just three weeks ago, he said there was hope and cautious optimism because of these talks. Now he's saying it's a lost cause.</p><p end="4241" is_meta="false" speaker="Peter Bergen" start="4183">Which one is it, Matthew?</p><p end="4241" is_meta="false" speaker="Matthew Hoh" start="4183">You guys do your homework.</p><p end="4241" is_meta="true" speaker="Matthew Hoh" start="4183">laughter</p><p end="4241" is_meta="false" speaker="Peter Bergen" start="4183">Sorry.</p><p end="4241" is_meta="false" speaker="Matthew Hoh" start="4183">Well, you know, they're both true. They are. I mean --</p><p end="4241" is_meta="false" speaker="Peter Bergen" start="4183">Okay.</p><p end="4241" is_meta="false" speaker="Matthew Hoh" start="4183">If you look at -- again, if you look at this conflict that's been going on for 30 years, if you understand that the Taliban are not a monolithic organization, that they're composed of multiple local groups with legitimate political grievances, then there is a need to negotiate to end the conflict.</p><p end="4303" is_meta="false" speaker="Matthew Hoh" start="4241">Go home tonight and look up a thing called the National Strategy for Victory in Iraq in 2005. This was our document. And I worked on it when I was in the State Department in 2005 after I came back from Iraq my first time. Go and look it up. We called it the NSVI. And it says the same things about the Iraqi insurgency. It's monolithic. They'reall terrorists. We can't negotiate with them. We can't leave Iraq because it will become a safe haven for terrorism. So the same things we did in 2003 to 2006, in terms of lumping the Iraqi insurgency together, calling them all terrorists, the same things we're doing now in Afghanistan. What changed in Iraq? And I can tell you when I was there in Anbar province, where --</p><p end="4303" is_meta="false" speaker="Matthew Hoh" start="4241">Yeah, sure. The point --</p><p end="4303" is_meta="false" speaker="Peter Bergen" start="4241">Does it give you hope or not as you wrote three weeks ago?</p><p end="4303" is_meta="false" speaker="Matthew Hoh" start="4241">Very cautious hope that there will be a breakthrough that we would start to peel off elements of the insurgency and shatter the insurgency and splinter the insurgency.</p><p end="4303" is_meta="false" speaker="Peter Bergen" start="4241">Cautious hope and lost cause are completely different things.</p><p end="4362" is_meta="false" speaker="Matthew Hoh" start="4303">Well, it depends what the cause is.</p><p end="4362" is_meta="false" speaker="Matthew Hoh" start="4303">The cause -- I think I wasn't -- I probably didn't have this debate in mind when I was talking to --</p><p end="4362" is_meta="true" speaker="Matthew Hoh" start="4303">laughter</p><p end="4362" is_meta="false" speaker="Matthew Hoh" start="4303">I mean -- you know, but honestly --</p><p end="4362" is_meta="false" speaker="Peter Bergen" start="4303">Do you take back what you wrote three weeks ago?</p><p end="4362" is_meta="false" speaker="Matthew Hoh" start="4303">No, of course not. No.</p><p end="4362" is_meta="false" speaker="Nir Rosen" start="4303">First of all, there are no talks. And Petraeus has done his best to nix those talks because he's adopting a very aggressive militaristic approach to Kandahar which isn&#8217;t even counterinsurgency, it's going back to the Russian operations of '83 and '84. But if Afghanistan is a cause in terms of a military strategy, with U.S. strategy as a very militaristic one and military focused, then, yes, there's no hope. But if you approach it as a political problem, then there is hope and that hope involves some kind of political settlement and abandoning this increased militaristic approach, but it just depends on how you define your terms.</p><p end="4362" is_meta="false" speaker="Max Boot" start="4303">[unintelligible] Can I just reply to [unintelligible]?</p><p end="4420" is_meta="false" speaker="Max Boot" start="4362">[unintelligible] because I think Nir must be talking about a different war than the one I'm familiar with, comparing what we're doing in Kandahar, for example, to what the Soviets did in the 1980s when they leveled the city and killed hundreds of thousands of people,</p><p end="4420" is_meta="false" speaker="Max Boot" start="4362">hey, I was in Kandahar this summer, we're not leveling the city, buddy, okay? Now, in terms of negotiations and how wonderful they are, there is no question that ultimately at some point a lot of this insurgency will be dealt with through negotiations, but the question is --</p><p end="4420" is_meta="true" speaker="Max Boot" start="4362">talking simultaneously</p><p end="4420" is_meta="false" speaker="Max Boot" start="4362">-- how do you set the conditions for those negotiations? What General Petraeus recognizes and which I don't think Nir Rosen seems to understand, is that first you have to convince your enemies they are not going to win at gunpoint. As one NATO officer put it to me in Kabul, he said, sure, you can give the -- first you have to knock the Taliban on their back, then you can give them a helping hand up. They have to beconvinced they are not going to win. At that point they will start to negotiate seriously.</p><p end="4420" is_meta="false" speaker="Max Boot" start="4362">We are only now starting the process of convincing them that they will not win because we are only now implementing a serious counterinsurgency strategy on the ground.</p><p end="4481" is_meta="false" speaker="Max Boot" start="4420">As we have more success in pacifying areas like Nawa, or Marjah, or Kandahar, then you will see the insurgents coming to the table and a lot of them giving up and stopping the fight. But they're not going to do it if they see Americans on the way out.</p><p end="4541" is_meta="false" speaker="Peter Bergen" start="4481">He would say that, wouldn't he? I mean, come on, this is a guy who was prepared to --</p><p end="4541" is_meta="false" speaker="Peter Bergen" start="4481">Mullah Omar was prepared to lose everything on the point of principle that he wasn't going to hand over bin Laden, and he did. This does not suggest that he's going to be Henry Kissinger in some future negotiation with us. This is a religious fanatic who very closely allied to another religious fanatic, Osama bin Laden. I was there under the Taliban. I can tell you that a doctor was earning six dollars a month, the World Bank stopped measuring the economic indicators of the country because there were none, all women were imprisoned in their homes, and all girls were not allowed to go to school.</p><p end="4541" is_meta="false" speaker="Peter Bergen" start="4481">This is the -- Mullah Omar is not a rational actor with whom we can do business. And it would be a moral catastrophe for us to allow him to come back into power in some shape or form.</p><p end="4605" is_meta="false" speaker="Nir Rosen" start="4541">No, but&#8212;</p><p end="4605" is_meta="false" speaker="Nir Rosen" start="4541">If we were to pull out and al-Qaeda came back to Afghanistan, I think that would be the greatest thing because right now they&#8217;re in Pakistan where we can&#8217;t actually get to them,</p><p end="4605" is_meta="false" speaker="Nir Rosen" start="4541">we can&#8217;t find them, there&#8217;s a much great infrastructure for al-Qaeda to hide in Pakistan,</p><p end="4605" is_meta="false" speaker="Nir Rosen" start="4541">dense urban areas in Karachi and other places where they can blend with the population.</p><p end="4605" is_meta="false" speaker="Nir Rosen" start="4541">In Afghanistan, if they have bases, whenever you want you can pound the hell out of them. Drop B-52 bombs on them be as brutal as you want. I think it&#8217;s also important to remember, al-Qaeda is not that big of a threat. They&#8217;ve had one success, September 11,</p><p end="4605" is_meta="false" speaker="Nir Rosen" start="4541">and that's it. So we shouldn't exaggerate this threat of al-Qaeda in the first place.</p><p end="4605" is_meta="true" speaker="Nir Rosen" start="4541">applause</p><p end="4665" is_meta="false" speaker="Nir Rosen" start="4605">The Taliban certainly are no threat. You&#8217;ve only had one Afghan ever try to attack America and that was Zazi here in New York and he spent most of his life here. You don&#8217;t have any Afghan Taliban trying to attack the U.S. outside of Afghanistan, of course where they&#8217;re occupied.</p><p end="4665" is_meta="false" speaker="Peter Bergen" start="4605">Except in Times Square just in May.</p><p end="4665" is_meta="false" speaker="Nir Rosen" start="4605">Pakistani Taliban, not Afghan.</p><p end="4665" is_meta="true" speaker="Nir Rosen" start="4605">simultaneous talking</p><p end="4665" is_meta="false" speaker="Peter Bergen" start="4605">[unintelligible] distinction without a difference. They are essentially the same group of people.</p><p end="4665" is_meta="false" speaker="Matthew Hoh" start="4605">When I was bringing up Iraq before, this is what we did for three or four years in Iraq.</p><p end="4665" is_meta="false" speaker="Matthew Hoh" start="4605">We conflated all the groups together, did not address any of the local grievances that those groups had.</p><p end="4720" is_meta="false" speaker="Matthew Hoh" start="4665">They had been usurped from power, they were excluded from the government. The outsiders were occupying them. This is -- if we want to keep this kind of mindset about the Taliban, then we can fight them for decades. Has everyone seen the film &#8220;Gladiator&#8221;?</p><p end="4720" is_meta="false" speaker="Matthew Hoh" start="4665">Okay, remember in the beginning they&#8217;re fighting the Germans and one general turns to Russell Crow and says &#8220;Don&#8217;t people ever know when they&#8217;re beaten?&#8221; And Russell Crow says, &#8220;Would you?&#8221; Same thing. This is human nature. It is, it&#8217;s human nature.</p><p end="4720" is_meta="false" speaker="Matthew Hoh" start="4665">Who here as a kid watched &#8220;Red Dawn&#8221;?</p><p end="4720" is_meta="false" speaker="Matthew Hoh" start="4665">[laughter]Okay? Right? I mean, when I went into the Marine Corp, you know, I grew up in my 10 years in the Marine Corp, &#8220;Red Dawn&#8221; was probably my favorite movie, okay? If the Russians had invaded, I would have fought them. It&#8217;s the same type of principle, okay?</p><p end="4720" is_meta="false" speaker="Matthew Hoh" start="4665">We&#8217;re dealing with people who primarily see the reason for supporting the Taliban as occupation and a government that excludes them.</p><p end="4784" is_meta="false" speaker="Matthew Hoh" start="4720">If we drive a wedge between them and the Taliban who [unintelligible], I&#8217;m not saying there are no Taliban who are aligned with al Qaeda. There are. But split them. Why fight all of them when we can negotiate with 80 percent of them.</p><p end="4844" is_meta="false" speaker="Matthew Hoh" start="4784">Yeah, the U.S. has spent since 2001, 50 billion dollars on foreign assistance in Afghanistan. The average life expectancy of an Afghan is 44 years of age. One in five children die before their fifth birthday. Yeah, one in five. So what is the biggest tragedyfor an American family is a rite of passage for an Afghan family. Access to electricity is less than 10 percent for the Afghan people and when I say access, that&#8217;s three to four hours. There have been some successes. But this is still a country that is ripped apart by war. So what you need to do is find a way to keep those successes and end the conflict in the other part of the country. So it is, it&#8217;s a mixed thing but to say that they&#8217;ve only benefited from our presence there, some have but many, many have not.</p><p end="4963" is_meta="false" speaker="Max Boot" start="4903">Well the problem of IEDs was actually far worse in Iraq than it is in Afghanistan. And what we found there and the general is right, there&#8217;s not a quick technological fix for IEDs. What works in getting rid of IEDs, the roadside bombs the insurgents set, is to implement classic counter-insurgency strategy, to bring security to the villages, to bringdevelopment to the villages, to protect the people from the insurgents. And once you protect them from the insurgents, they will then be willing to rat out the insurgents who are in their midst and tell you where the IEDs are being planted. That is exactly the strategy that our forces are now implementing in Afghanistan. They are bringing security to the villages and to the towns. And as they do that, as they provide a more secure environment, it will be impossible for the Taliban to plant IEDs. There is not a quick technological fix to it. But what we found is that these classic tried and true counterinsurgency techniques are incredibly successful.</p><p end="5025" is_meta="false" speaker="Max Boot" start="4963">In Afghanistan -- in Iraq, they led within a couple of years to a more than 90 percent decline in violence.</p><p end="5025" is_meta="true" speaker="Max Boot" start="4963">talking simultaneously</p><p end="5025" is_meta="false" speaker="Max Boot" start="4963">[unintelligible] taking effect in Afghanistan. I see similar success happening in areas like Nala where our troops have been a little bit longer than they are in --</p><p end="5025" is_meta="false" speaker="Matthew Hoh" start="4963">Actually, when I was in Iraq, I was a combat engineer in the Marine Corps where I had to actually go out and look for IEDs. Or my marines -- I was an officer, so my marines did,</p><p end="5025" is_meta="false" speaker="Matthew Hoh" start="4963">you know. But Max is correct, but it's not working. Gareth Porter, a journalist for Inter Press Service --</p><p end="5025" is_meta="false" speaker="Max Boot" start="4963">We don't know it's not working.</p><p end="5025" is_meta="false" speaker="Matthew Hoh" start="4963">We know it's not working, Max, because --</p><p end="5025" is_meta="false" speaker="Max Boot" start="4963">We're just starting to do it now.</p><p end="5025" is_meta="false" speaker="Matthew Hoh" start="4963">No, we're not starting to do it. Has there -- I mean, again, I'll refer to a movie because it's -- we've been doing counterinsurgency for years --</p><p end="5025" is_meta="false" speaker="Max Boot" start="4963">I can't argue with &#8220;Red Dawn.&#8221; You've got me there.</p><p end="5025" is_meta="false" speaker="Max Boot" start="4963">Matthew Hoh:Yeah.it is a great film, right? But I would urge you all to see the film &#8220;Restrepo&#8221;--it's a documentary done by a journalist-- to see what it's like to be an American infantryman in Afghanistan. But that film was done three and a half years ago. And you see our soldiers doing counterinsurgency then.</p><p end="5083" is_meta="false" speaker="Max Boot" start="5025">The Lieutenant General Barno who was in command of our forces in 2004 said we are moving to a counterinsurgency strategy. What Max is talking about, and he's right, that is counterinsurgency strategy to try and get the population to support you and turn in the IEDs. In southern Afghanistan where we have insurgent troops for several years now, the first marines, the first U.S. Marines went back into southern Afghanistan two and a half years ago into those parts of Hellman where we're still losing guys every day. The success rate and the percentage of IEDs that were being turned in by the population, less than two percent. The population is not embracing our presence.</p><p end="5203" is_meta="false" speaker="Matthew Hoh" start="5143">What's scary is that we've spent $27 billion building the Afghan police and the Afghan army after nine years, and we can't rely on them to protect humanitarian assistance projects. Losing the private security for development workers there is very troubling.</p><p end="5203" is_meta="false" speaker="Matthew Hoh" start="5143">And it will have a severe impact on humanitarian assistance.</p><p end="5203" is_meta="false" speaker="Max Boot" start="5143">Actually, I think this is a good move on President Karzai's part because these private security companies have been a big part of the problem in Afghanistan because they've run roughshod over a lot of the country. And we've relied upon them for years because we didn't make a serious effort to send our own troops or to build up the Afghan security forces. We have not tried to create an Afghan security force large enough to stabilize and secure the entire country.</p><p end="5264" is_meta="false" speaker="Max Boot" start="5203">We're only now making that attempt. And as we do that, we can be less reliant on the private contractors who are out of control in many cases and under poor supervision.</p><p end="5264" is_meta="false" speaker="Max Boot" start="5203">And we can rely more on our own troops and more on the Afghan troops that they are mentoring alongside of them. And you will see an increase in security. So I think this is actually -- I'm critical of President Karzai for a lot of things, but I think is actually a positive initiative.</p><p end="5264" is_meta="false" speaker="Nir Rosen" start="5203">The Afghan troops are part of the problem. It's the Afghan police who are the best recruiters for the Taliban by oppressing people, by stealing from them, by demanding bribes.</p><p end="5264" is_meta="false" speaker="Max Boot" start="5203">That's because they haven't had salaries, and they haven't had training. And both of that is changing there.</p><p end="5325" is_meta="false" speaker="Max Boot" start="5264">Well, guess what, folks? My pre-debate intuition held up pretty well. The other side has not even come close to proving their case that Afghanistan is a lost cause. What they have essentially done is they've thrown up various problems that exist in Afghanistan.</p><p end="5325" is_meta="false" speaker="Max Boot" start="5264">And I -- we agree with them. There are a lot of problems that exist. There are a lot of problems that existed in Iraq. There are a lot of problems that existed in Malay and Colombia and El Salvador, in Peru and many other places where insurgencies have been defeated. But the fact that the problems exist does not mean that we cannot overcome them. And for the very first time, we are making a serious effort to overcome them.</p><p end="5325" is_meta="false" speaker="Max Boot" start="5264">Matt talked to you about how we've been trying to do counterinsurgency in Afghanistan for years. No, we haven't. We have not made a serious commitment to do counterinsurgency in Afghanistan until right now.</p><p end="5381" is_meta="false" speaker="Max Boot" start="5325">When you have 30,000 troops in a country of 30 million people, you are not doing serious counterinsurgency, no matter what your generals say. We are starting to do serious counterinsurgency right now with hardened -- battle hardened troops, experienced in both Afghanistan and Iraq, led by our finest general, implementing many of the lessons we have learned, not only in Iraq but many other conflicts. We are addressing local grievances, the very things that Matt says is driving the insurgency. We are working with provincial reconstruction teams and district support teams to improve lighting, to decrease corruption, to improve economic development, all these things that people want.</p><p end="5381" is_meta="false" speaker="Max Boot" start="5325">There is -- I think it is crazy right now when the surge is just beginning to suggest that it already has no chance of success. It is ahistorical. It -- when you look at the fact that, as I mentioned in my opening statements, many wars have been won when countries faced far more dire circumstances than we face today.</p><p end="5443" is_meta="false" speaker="Max Boot" start="5381">And I go back to the fact that the people of Afghanistan are fundamentally on our side.</p><p end="5443" is_meta="false" speaker="Max Boot" start="5381">Somebody asked, &#8220;Well, if they're on our side, why aren't they fighting for us?&#8221; Well,</p><p end="5443" is_meta="false" speaker="Max Boot" start="5381">the fact is they are fighting for us. More than 250,000 Afghans are in the Afghan security forces. Only about 30,000 or even fewer are in the Taliban. Ten times more are fighting on the side of the government. And those numbers are increasing. So I urge you to standwith the brave people of Afghanistan to resist the tyranny they hate and that will threaten us if the Taliban should ever return to power.</p><p end="5443" is_meta="false" speaker="Matthew Hoh" start="5381">Thanks, John. I've been doing counterinsurgency all my adult life. Before the wars, I was stationed in Okinawa, Japan. We used to go and work with our counterparts in Thailand and Philippines and Indonesia who are all fighting active insurgencies. I've been doing this.</p><p end="5504" is_meta="false" speaker="Matthew Hoh" start="5443">This is not the same as those insurgencies. It's not the same as Iraq. What we are involved in, what we're entangled in is a 30-year-old civil war that has roots that go well before the existence of al-Qaeda. We also have to -- and again, what I just said there was al-Qaeda. What effect are we having on al-Qaeda? How is this making America safer?</p><p end="5504" is_meta="false" speaker="Matthew Hoh" start="5443">And that's the question that you need to go home with tonight. And to be honest, you know, I'm probably the worst debater you've ever had because I really don't care who wins the debate because at the end of the night, we're all going home. But there's a hundred thousand Marines, soldiers, sailors and airmen who are in Afghanistan who, you know, it's not theoretical to them. You know, this kid named Lieutenant Robert Kelly who was killed just yesterday. His family is not having a hypothetical debate on these issues. This is very real for a lot of people.</p><p end="5566" is_meta="false" speaker="Matthew Hoh" start="5504">And it's something that, when you go home tonight, keep in mind, and keep thinking about it, and keep talking about it. You know the percentage of people who voted on this issue in the midterms? Less than eight percent. So these guys all have great books, and I encourage you to go and read their books. And I encourage you to do your research on your own on this and to talk about it with your friends and neighbors, because, like I said,</p><p end="5566" is_meta="false" speaker="Matthew Hoh" start="5504">we go home tonight, there are a hundred 100,000 American soldiers, sailors, airmen, and Marines who are not going home tonight, and some of them will never go home. So just please keep that in mind.</p><p end="5566" is_meta="false" speaker="Peter Bergen" start="5504">I'd also like you to think about the 3,000 families who didn't have anybody come home on the night of September 11th. And that's just as important a sacrifice and it's something we cannot let happen again.</p><p end="5624" is_meta="false" speaker="Peter Bergen" start="5566">And I'd also like you to think about the history of Afghanistan. Think about the Soviet invasion that killed a million Afghans and made five million of them homeless. That was a lost cause. Think about the Civil War where hundreds of thousands or more Afghans then died. That was a lost cause. Think about the Taliban. I don't need to detain you with what they did to the country. That was a lost cause. It's not surprising that 68 percent of Afghans have a favorable view of the U.S. military and 42 percent of them blame the violence in the country on the Taliban and only three percent on NATO and the United States because they well understand what a catastrophe it would be for the Taliban to come back. 70 percent of Afghans have a favorable view of the future. They know what they're living through is better than anything in the last 30 years. They don't think it's a lost cause. Don't take our word for it. Think about what they think about as they go to work without having the Taliban ruling over them in a brutal and incompetent method every day.</p><p end="5682" is_meta="true" speaker="Peter Bergen" start="5624">applause</p><p end="5682" is_meta="false" speaker="Nir Rosen" start="5624">Peter said that the refugees from Iran and Pakistan have gone home. They've gone home because Iran and Pakistan expelled them from there so they could go back to Afghanistan. He also said that Washington, D.C. is more dangerous. It's true in a certain sense. You may be killed by criminals there. But there's no insurgency there. It's not the police and the State that are being attacked in D.C. as they are in Afghanistan where there is just no -- you cannot have a State in most of the country these days because they're being undermined. And a white person like Peter cannot walk in most of Afghanistanwithout being kidnapped by criminals or killed by the Taliban or just held for ransom.</p><p end="5682" is_meta="false" speaker="Nir Rosen" start="5624">We're destabilizing Pakistan, a key country with nuclear weapons and a rivalry with India, much more dangerous and much more problematic than Afghanistan.</p><p end="5745" is_meta="false" speaker="Nir Rosen" start="5682">We're even doing counterinsurgency in Pakistan these days. In Kandahar it's just going back to massive military sweeps using a warlord, not the Afghan army, a warlord who in the past has pushed people into the hands of the Taliban. Al-Qaeda -- you've never had an Afghan, except for one guy, ever try to attack Americans, and that's Zazi. So you don't have any kind of history of Afghan Taliban trying to attack the U.S., they're a very local nationalist group, obviously very retrograde. In fact, this is what&#8217;s so depressing with the situation. We&#8217;ve managed to make in the eyes of many Afghans the Taliban look good, this is how incompetent we&#8217;ve been until now. This is not the first surge, this is the fifth surge. We keep on trying more and more of the same thing. The generals are begging, "Just give us a little bit more time." So far there&#8217;s no sign that it&#8217;s working.</p><p end="5745" is_meta="false" speaker="Nir Rosen" start="5682">Why would you trust them? I mean, they have a history of lying. Petraeus in 2004 wrote a letter to the "Washington Post" talking about how great the Iraqi security forces were.</p><p end="5745" is_meta="false" speaker="Nir Rosen" start="5682">Just a few months later they were involved in brutal attacks against the Iraqi population.</p><p end="5745" is_meta="false" speaker="Nir Rosen" start="5682">Finally, if you want to defeat al-Qaeda, you have to at some point address the grievances.</p><p end="5807" is_meta="false" speaker="Nir Rosen" start="5745">We&#8217;re supporting dictatorships throughout the Middle East, we&#8217;re backing Israel blindly,</p><p end="5807" is_meta="false" speaker="Nir Rosen" start="5745">there are specific reasons why there are people in the Muslim world who resent the U.S.</p><p end="5807" is_meta="false" speaker="Nir Rosen" start="5745">Or you could ignore it and say, "Okay, we want to have cheap oil. We want to be this empire that supports dictatorships in Pakistan, Egypt, Saudi Arabia." As a result of that,</p><p end="5807" is_meta="false" speaker="Nir Rosen" start="5745">though, you&#8217;re always going to have a small group of people who are going to want to seek revenge unless we change who we are at some point.</p></transcript></debate>
