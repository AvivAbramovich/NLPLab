Yeah, that was a reward given along with two of my ac ademic colleagues for basically developing the tools that have allowed us to create the GMO crops .</p><p end="365" is_meta="false" speaker="Robert Fraley" start="305">Yep.</p><p end="365" is_meta="false" speaker="Robert Fraley" start="305">And I'm joined tonight by my partner, Alison Van Eenennaam, who is going to talk about the technology as well and the benefits.</p><p end="365" is_meta="false" speaker="Alison Van Eenennaam" start="305">Well, I'm an urban girl, I was born in the city in Australia, and I'm kind of a science nerd,</p><p end="365" is_meta="false" speaker="Alison Van Eenennaam" start="305">still am actually, and I was interested in how we might use science to improve the productivity of agriculture.</p><p end="419" is_meta="false" speaker="Alison Van Eenennaam" start="365">And it's what I've spent my career pursuing.</p><p end="419" is_meta="false" speaker="Alison Van Eenennaam" start="365">John Donvan:Thank you, Alison Van Eenennaam. That's the team arguing for the motion.</p><p end="419" is_meta="true" speaker="Alison Van Eenennaam" start="365">applause</p><p end="419" is_meta="false" speaker="Charles Benbrook" start="365">I am, John . We've -- we're well prepared, Mar di and I, and since we have the facts and science on our side I think we'll be fine.</p><p end="419" is_meta="true" speaker="Charles Benbrook" start="365">laughter</p><p end="419" is_meta="false" speaker="Charles Benbrook" start="365">My partner --</p><p end="419" is_meta="false" speaker="Margaret Mellon" start="365">Hello.</p><p end="419" is_meta="false" speaker="Charles Benbrook" start="365">-- Margaret or Mar di Mellon, is going to help me make the case.</p><p end="484" is_meta="false" speaker="Margaret Mellon" start="419">Yes.</p><p end="484" is_meta="false" speaker="Margaret Mellon" start="419">Well, I don't think so . But my last name also sounds like a bank and --</p><p end="484" is_meta="true" speaker="Margaret Mellon" start="419">laughter</p><p end="484" is_meta="false" speaker="Margaret Mellon" start="419">-- money is probably as important as food in this debate.</p><p end="605" is_meta="false" speaker="Robert Fraley" start="542">John, thanks . And I really appreciate the opportunity to be here . This subject is very important to me . It's really been my life . It started -- I grew up on a -- on a family farm in the central part of the United States . I was one of those -- I wouldn't have thought of myself as a nerd, but I was one of those kids who always knew he wanted to be a scientist . And I had the -- I had the unique privilege, after getting my doctorate degree,</p><p end="605" is_meta="false" speaker="Robert Fraley" start="542">to attend the Univ ersity of California at San Francisco, which was kind of the epicenter where GMO research started .</p><p end="662" is_meta="false" speaker="Robert Fraley" start="605">And even back then, it was pretty clear that GMO technology would have a profound implication in health care . And just as a quick test of the a udience -- how many of you know a nybody who's a diabetic and takes insulin ? So, a lot of hands .</p><p end="662" is_meta="true" speaker="Robert Fraley" start="605">applause</p><p end="662" is_meta="false" speaker="Robert Fraley" start="605">So, actually, insulin was the first GMO product . And now, you know, that's the typical treatment . And it's a safer, better product. Today, in health care, just to give you a sense of the transformation, six of the top -selling drugs in the United States are based on GMO technology . So, tremendous progress . Let me -- let me make it a little more food related . How many of you eat cheese?</p><p end="662" is_meta="true" speaker="Robert Fraley" start="605">applause</p><p end="662" is_meta="false" speaker="Robert Fraley" start="605">All right . The first actual GMO product ever approved for food use was a product called rennet . Rennet is the enzyme that's actually used to make cheese . And today, 90 percent of our cheeses are based on GMOs, using a safer approach and a more effective way of making the technology.</p><p end="724" is_meta="false" speaker="Robert Fraley" start="662">So, as I said in the introduction, you know, I helped develop the first GMO plants back in the -- in the early 1980s . And then we took about another 15 years of additional studies and development before the first commercial products were launched in the -- in the mid 1990s . And those were products that helped farmers protect against insects and protect against weeds . So , for insect protection, we actually use the very same BT protein that is used by organic farmers for years, and built that into the plants to protect them from insects . And as a result of that, we saw dramatic reduction in insecticide use and an increase in -- in crop yields . And the herbicide tolerant crops, and herbicide tolerant crops have been a great enabler . They've enabled farmers to use safer and more environmentally friendly chemicals and replace the products that were previously used, but they 've also had a profound benefit to the environment, of enabling farmers to not plow their soils .</p><p end="782" is_meta="false" speaker="Robert Fraley" start="724">And as a result, use less energy, release less carbon, and -- and reduce erosion, which have been key . Today, if you look around the world, GMO crops are grown in about 27 countries . They're being used by 18 million &#8211; [unintelligible] farmers . And to put it in perspective, this has been the most rapidly -adopted technology in the history of agriculture . And that's because the benefits have been so real and so clear. As I said,</p><p end="782" is_meta="false" speaker="Robert Fraley" start="724">it's reduced pesticide use . It's helped farmers to produce more food and bring it, you know, from their harvest into -- into the -- into the -- into consumption. It's preserved our soils . It's reduced greenhouse gas emi ssions and a lot of benefits. Now, you're going to hear different perspectives tonight on the technology . But here's a simple logic test . As I said, I grew up on a farm. I've watched my dad make those decisions on which seeds to buy, which equipment to use, et cetera, et cetera . I can tell you that there's no farmer who would plant GMO crops if they didn't have a real benefit.</p><p end="846" is_meta="false" speaker="Robert Fraley" start="782">And they certainly wouldn't have planted them for the last 20 years if they didn't have real value . So, the impact of GMOs has been amazing, and lots of applications across companies and universities . And my partner, Dr. Alison Van Eenennaam, is going to describe a lot of those applications that are still being developed. I'd like to step back and say, as a scientis t and a father, the safety of these products is -- is absolutely on the -- on the top of my mind. And what I'm most proud about is the fact that these technologies have been in the marketplace for over 20 years, and there's not been a single, not one issu e of food or feed safety ever associated with the technology . And I'd make this point, that there's a strong scientific consensus on the safety of GMOs, as I --</p><p end="846" is_meta="false" speaker="Robert Fraley" start="782">as there is on the role of greenhouse gases and climate change, so that's -- that's very impor tant. The last area I'd like to highlight is that the safety actually starts with the fact that mankind has been genetically modifying and selecting crops from the beginning of time .</p><p end="903" is_meta="false" speaker="Robert Fraley" start="846">And whether you're looking at modern -day corn or tomatoes, or you're looking at peaches or soybeans, we've been moving genes around from the -- from the beginning of time . But through biotechnology, we're able to do it even more precisely, literally one gene at a time, and that's key . Also, this technology is highly regulated . It's regulated by the government agencies in the U.S . But it's important to realize that we export grains to 40 countries around the world who have all researched and appr oved these products . Alison's going to talk about some of the safe ty studies. Bottom line from those studies is these are the most thoroughly studied foods in our food supply,</p><p end="903" is_meta="false" speaker="Robert Fraley" start="846">and they are absolutely safe . Now, let me make a couple of quick points as a scientist</p><p end="903" is_meta="false" speaker="Robert Fraley" start="846">who's been involved in this his -- his whole career. First of all, GMOs are not the Holy Grail. What they are is an important tool , if used properly, can have a huge impact in bringing remarkable new products to farmers and benefit consumers for a long time.</p><p end="964" is_meta="false" speaker="Robert Fraley" start="903">Second, GMOs aren't the only tool we need. We need to continue to invest in plant breeding, we need to continue to invest in new areas like precision agriculture . We need to invest in organic farming techniques and other tools . And fi nally, let me jus t say, GMOs, are they perfect ? Absolutely not. You know, they need to be regulated,</p><p end="964" is_meta="false" speaker="Robert Fraley" start="903">they need to be managed wisely, like -- like any technology . And, for example, we know that insects can become resistant to GMO crops just like they can to other insecticides.</p><p end="964" is_meta="false" speaker="Robert Fraley" start="903">We know that -- that weeds can evolve resistance, whether, you know, to herbicides,</p><p end="964" is_meta="false" speaker="Robert Fraley" start="903">whether those are herbicides used in GMO crops or other systems . But I also know that -- and I acknowledge that these are legitimate concerns, but I also know that the science can make a huge impact to manage these technologies . So -- and this is so key as we --</p><p end="964" is_meta="false" speaker="Robert Fraley" start="903">as we think about the future, because we are on the brink of facing one of mankind's greatest challenges . Global population continues to grow .</p><p end="1023" is_meta="false" speaker="Robert Fraley" start="964">It's going to reach 9.5 billion by 2050 . Another 2 or 3 billion people will join the middle class . The demand for food will double by 2050 . And so the decisions we make and the votes that you make tonight are really important. We will need to produce more food in the next 36 years than we have in the entire history of the world. So , it's a daunting challenge, and we're going to have to do that in the face of climate change and water shortage as we go forward . But I want to be clear, and I want to leave you with this optimistic note as I summarize . We can do this, but it means working together, and it means --</p><p end="1023" is_meta="false" speaker="Robert Fraley" start="964">-- finding a common ground.</p><p end="1023" is_meta="false" speaker="Robert Fraley" start="964">-- and using all of our tools so --</p><p end="1023" is_meta="false" speaker="Robert Fraley" start="964">Thank you.</p><p end="1086" is_meta="false" speaker="Margaret Mellon" start="1023">Thank you very much, and thanks to Robb . He made a number of points that I think we're going to come back to over the -- over the course of the debate . But I want to focus my remarks, really, on just one point, and that is whether or not gene tically modified or genetically engineered -- I'm going to use those two words interchangeably -- whether those technologies are essential or even an important technologies for meeting the challenge of feeding 9 billion people without destroying the earth. And that means raising our productivity but without dead zones in the Gulf of Mexico,</p><p end="1086" is_meta="false" speaker="Margaret Mellon" start="1023">without a Lake Erie or that h as -- you know, in some parts of the year is now just a toxic algal soup . It's a huge challenge . Now, I'm going to argue against that . But I understand why a lot of people believe that genetic engineering is the answer.</p><p end="1146" is_meta="false" speaker="Margaret Mellon" start="1086">And I think a lot of that has to do with the way the technology debuted. I mean, I was there in the early days when Monsanto came up with its products . I was working in Washington, D.C . for the environmental community . The place was abuzz with the idea that a new molecular technology was on the way that would convert agriculture into an environmentally benign activity . I was at the wildlife -- at the National Wildlife Federation when Monsanto folks came and said, &#8220;You people in the environmental community ought to be the first to embrace this technology because it's going to reduce pesticide use." I wanted to learn more, and I did when I went to Monsanto and got the tour out in St. Louis . And I was told, it's not only going to reduce toxic use of chemist --</p><p end="1146" is_meta="false" speaker="Margaret Mellon" start="1086">of chemicals, it's going to produce crops that can fertilize themselves .</p><p end="1204" is_meta="false" speaker="Margaret Mellon" start="1146">It's going to produce crops that are high yielding, that'll make famine a thing of the past,</p><p end="1204" is_meta="false" speaker="Margaret Mellon" start="1146">that are re -- resistant to stress, to cold, to drought, to heat . It was a -- it was a really compelling and -- and a vision I was really taken by . My big question was that it was a brand -new technology using very new tec hniques, and would it work? Well, we have had now 30 years to find out whether it's going to work, billions of dollars in investment in it . And I think there's just no doubt that compared to the vision, the early vision, it's a big disappointment. Now, after 30 years, there are no crops out there that fertilize themselves . There's one drought- tolerant crop that's drought tolerant because of genetic engineering .</p><p end="1264" is_meta="false" speaker="Margaret Mellon" start="1204">There are no crops whose yields are the result of genetic engineering apart from making them better able to deal with pests . You know, there are no genetically engineered crops that resist water logging . I mean, you name it. It really hasn't happened, with one exception, which we've heard about, which is in the area of pest management, genetic engineering has been wildly successful . I mean, people have adopted it all over the world . And -- and that's because in the early days, the technology did deliver . It made it possible -- people that us e Roundup-ready crops and B t crops in the early days, their pesticide use went down . That's why their costs down, that's why their farms were easier to manage, even as they got bigger . And farmers -- you know, farmers were really happy about that.</p><p end="1320" is_meta="false" speaker="Margaret Mellon" start="1264">But, you know, as one farmer has said, not too recently, the days of -- I mean, we've run through the best herbicide that the -- that the world had to offer . Glyphosate is no longer as useful as it once was, and it's getting less useful every day because resistant weeds ar e coming, and those resistant weeds are leading to more -- those resistant weeds are leading to greater and greater use of herbicides . And we are now at a point where, I mean, if you look forward, I'm going to let my colleague, Dr. Benbrook talkabout this more, but there is, you know, nothing ahead of us except sky rocketing use,</p><p end="1320" is_meta="false" speaker="Margaret Mellon" start="1264">not only of Glyphosate , which is the major herbicide in Roundup, but of other herbicides</p><p end="1320" is_meta="false" speaker="Margaret Mellon" start="1264">-- 2,4 -D, Dicamba -- herbicides we thought we'd never have to use much of -- much of again.</p><p end="1389" is_meta="false" speaker="Margaret Mellon" start="1320">So , I guess to answer -- what I want -- I do want to say that we -- we now know why . I mean, genetically engineered -- it turns out to be a lot harder to do genetic engineering than I think anybody thought in the early days . And it's especially hard when you're dealing with complex traits that involve a number of genes . That's why yield and stress resistance have proven to be so difficult. But these pesticide technologies have involved really only the transfer o f a single gene, and they -- you know, they have worked in the case of the two products we've talked about. But, you know, to answer my first question, a technology that, after 30 years, has not delivered, you know, on the full -- on the full range of pro ducts that it kind of promised to the public early on, and in the one application where it has delivered, the benefits of the technology are now being reversed, and we are going in the direction of increased herbicide use .</p><p end="1444" is_meta="false" speaker="Margaret Mellon" start="1389">I mean, that is not a technology that is either essential or I would argue even important to addressing the major agricultural challenges ahead of us . Fortunately, we've got other technologies out there . They're far more powerful than genetic engineering .</p><p end="1444" is_meta="false" speaker="Margaret Mellon" start="1389">Th ey&#8217;re traditional breeding and agro economy -- ecology we're going to talk abou t them later. But before we can talk about them, we need to be clear about what genetic engineering can't do . And we don't want to ban it, we don't want to abandon research on it, but we do kind of want to move it off to the side of the -- of the stage . And in order to do that, you have to rebalance the debate . You have to kind of take the rose colored glasses off and you can start that process right here, right tonight, by voting</p><p end="1444" is_meta="false" speaker="Margaret Mellon" start="1389">"No" on "Genetically Modify Food."</p><p end="1506" is_meta="false" speaker="Alison Van Eenennaam" start="1444">Wow, it's a great turnout here tonight, it&#8217;s no t my usual audience . I spend a lot of my time talking to farmers and ranchers . And it's my pleasure to be here speaking to you tonight. I'd like to start with a premise that I hope we can all agree on, and that is in the future more people are going to need to be fed better with less environmental impact.</p><p end="1506" is_meta="false" speaker="Alison Van Eenennaam" start="1444">And as a public sector scientist, my interest is finding real -world solutions to that problem .</p><p end="1557" is_meta="false" speaker="Alison Van Eenennaam" start="1506">And to me GM food offers one of those solutions . It's derived from crops produced using a br eeding method based on the movement of useful genes from one species into another . Tonight I'll spend some time discussing the impressive safety record of GM crops, how they've provided well -documented benefits, and how GM is sometimes uniquely able to de liver a useful trait like crops that are more resilient to climate change . And I will contend that the benefits of GM are too great to vote anything but "Yes" for GM tonight . GMO technology often gets conflated with Monsanto and Big Ag,</p><p end="1557" is_meta="false" speaker="Alison Van Eenennaam" start="1506">but it's actually a breeding tool, one that can be used for many purposes . In my own research, in selection for disease resistant cattle , I use many breeding methods ,</p><p end="1557" is_meta="false" speaker="Alison Van Eenennaam" start="1506">including classical selection for healthy animals and, more recently, the use of DNA markers to assist in selecting for disease resistant genes .</p><p end="1620" is_meta="false" speaker="Alison Van Eenennaam" start="1557">As a geneticist I can envision how combining GM with these other breeding methods,</p><p end="1620" is_meta="false" speaker="Alison Van Eenennaam" start="1557">because they a re not mutually exclusive, could accelerate the progress of my publicly funded research program by enabling me to use GM to directly protect cattle from infection. This would be associated with reduced illness and the decreased use of antibiotics, something I think is perhaps a common shared value amongst this group . As Rob b mentioned, most commercialized GMO crops today have been made to resist insects and herbicides and have been adopted by 18 million farmers globally, but importantly 16.5 million of those farmers are in the developing world, both men and women, some of whom farm areas smaller than the size of the auditorium tonight .</p><p end="1620" is_meta="false" speaker="Alison Van Eenennaam" start="1557">What have been the impacts of this widespread adoption? As a scientist I go to the independent, peer-reviewed literature to answer such questions, especially reviews and meta- analyses that present a summary of many independent studies . It's like a well-</p><p end="1620" is_meta="false" speaker="Alison Van Eenennaam" start="1557">informed referee presenting an objective assessment of the state of play .</p><p end="1687" is_meta="false" speaker="Alison Van Eenennaam" start="1620">Recently, German university professors published a comprehensive analysis of 147 separate studies that assess the impact of GM crops . They found that the benefits were significant not only in the U.S . but more importantly in the developing world. On average, GM technol ogy adoption has reduced chemical pesticide use by 37 percent,</p><p end="1687" is_meta="false" speaker="Alison Van Eenennaam" start="1620">increased yields by 22 percent, and increased farmer profits by 68 percent . The yield gains are due to more effective pest control and thus lower crop damage . And the benefits have been large st for smallholder farmers in developing countries who have dramatically reduced their insecticide applications as a result of GM crops . This has benefitted both farmer health and also the environment and beneficial insects . Now researchers throughout th e public and private sector are using this breeding tool to deliver other benefits to society . Researchers at Hawaii and Cornell University have used it to produce a virus resistant papaya, a product which has literally saved the Hawaiian papaya industry.</p><p end="1740" is_meta="false" speaker="Alison Van Eenennaam" start="1687">Other introductions include drought resistant corn, virus resistant squash, consumer traits like a non -browning apple, a low -acrylamide potato, and crops that produce oils improved for nutrition . None of these applications require the use of any chemical pesticides, an issue that often gets conflated with this technology . University researchers are working to develop GM oranges that are resistant to citrus greening disease, something that is devastating the Florida orange industry . And here in New York, researchers are using a wheat gene to develop GM American chestnut trees resistant to the imported chestnut blight. If approved, these trees will be distributed to the public in a not for profit program to restore the Ameri can chestnut tree to the eastern forests . Plant diseases annually destroy some 15 percent of our world's agricultural harvest, a number that is likely to grow as our climate changes .</p><p end="1797" is_meta="false" speaker="Alison Van Eenennaam" start="1740">There are many publicly funded groups around the world, wo rking to develop GM-</p><p end="1797" is_meta="false" speaker="Alison Van Eenennaam" start="1740">disease resistant varieties of crops, including apples, bananas, cassava, cowpea,</p><p end="1797" is_meta="false" speaker="Alison Van Eenennaam" start="1740">eggplant, grapes, potatoes, rice, sweet potatoes, and wheat . Some of these staple crops are an essential source of nutrient in t he diets of the poor. And it doesn't stop at plants .</p><p end="1797" is_meta="false" speaker="Alison Van Eenennaam" start="1740">Researchers at CUNY are working with an international consortium to develop genetically -engineered cattle that are resistant to African Sleeping Sickness, a disease that kills several thousand people a nd three million cattle annually. This project is being publicly funded by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, and the U.S . National Science Foundation. All of these GM applications focus on controlling disease with genetics rather than chemicals, an objective that I would argue is compatible with agroecology ,</p><p end="1797" is_meta="false" speaker="Alison Van Eenennaam" start="1740">sustainability, and feeding more people better with less environmental impact . There are literally dozens of other applications and field trials globally.</p><p end="1865" is_meta="false" speaker="Alison Van Eenennaam" start="1797">Nitrogen -efficient and flood- tolerant rice. Drought- tolerant wheat . And Bio Cassava P lus, a private -public partnership that will use GM to increase the nutrient levels, shelf life, and disease resistance of cassava, a major source of carbohydrates in parts of the world . Improved cassava harvests could increase the incomes of African households,</p><p end="1865" is_meta="false" speaker="Alison Van Eenennaam" start="1797">helping lift poor farmers -- many of them women -- out of poverty . I could go on, but none of this would be possible without the broad scientific consensus about the safety of GM and solidated [spelled phonetically] and support that consensus . A 2013 review article, written by independent Italian public sector scientists, reviewed over 1,700 scientific records on GE crop safety published this past decade, and concluded that the scientific research conducted so far has not detected any significant hazards directly connected with the use of GE crops . My own 2014 review paper examined both well -</p><p end="1865" is_meta="false" speaker="Alison Van Eenennaam" start="1797">designed animal feeding studies and the field performance and health tre nds of the over 100 billion food producing animals that have been consuming GM feed over the last decade, and found no credible evidence of harm .</p><p end="1920" is_meta="false" speaker="Alison Van Eenennaam" start="1865">T he American Association for the Advancement of Science, the world's largest and most prestigiou s scientific society, stated in 2012 that science is quite clear: crop improvement by modern molecular techniques of biotechnology is safe . They're joined by the World Health Organization, the American Medical Association, the U.S. National Academy of Sciences, the British Royal Society, and every major regulatory agency in the world . Given the realized benefits, the potential of this science, and the documented safety record, I urge you to allow breeders to use this valuable method to improve crops an d vote yes for tonight's motion.</p><p end="1978" is_meta="false" speaker="Charles Benbrook" start="1920">I do think it's time for sort of a national fireside chat about the applications of agricultural biotechnology in food production . And I'm actually glad it's happening.</p><p end="1978" is_meta="false" speaker="Charles Benbrook" start="1920">We've had a number of highly contested state level ball ot initiatives on labeling of GE food . And as a result, the awareness and consciousness of people around the coun try is going up . And that's a good thing.</p><p end="2039" is_meta="false" speaker="Charles Benbrook" start="1978">The -- there's tough choices for our society about whether we want to go down this road of more intensive, specialized input intensive agriculture, kind of with genetic engineering leading the train, or whether we want to steer agriculture in some other directions . So, a couple of things I ask of the audience, as you listen to the back and forth tonight. And there'll be -- there'll be a lot of it . I ask you to vote on the reality of what genetically engineered crops, the ones that are on the market today, have actually brought about, and not just how well they work for the first three or four years . And I think, you know, the record is very clear, they were rapidly adopted . They worked very well . They were spectacularly effective in particularly the Roundup Ready crops. And these are the so -called herbicide tolerant crops, which made it easy for farmers to control weeds in corn, soybeans, and cotton. Those were the three big crops . We'll mostly t alk about those tonight .</p><p end="2102" is_meta="false" speaker="Charles Benbrook" start="2039">So , don't -- you know, don't base this on the promise and the aspirations of the biotechnology industry and the things that the biotech industry thinks that at some point the science will deliver, things like corn pla nts that fix their own nitrogen or drought tolerant crops or nutritionally enhanced crops . Some of these things may eventually be achieved, but they haven't yet. And I ask you to think about the -- what's the reality of genetic engineering agriculture today as opposed to the promise or the aspiration . I also suggest and ask you to think about the impacts of genetically engineered crops as a package . It's not just the genes that Robb Fraley and his colleagues at Monsanto were able to work into the corn plant, but you have to think about how that corn plant behaves in the field, the yields, what the impacts of the BTproteins that are all throughout that plant are on the environment, o n aquatic ecosystems, on the cost to farmers .</p><p end="2163" is_meta="false" speaker="Charles Benbrook" start="2102">And, of course, in the case of the herbicide tolerant crops, the great concern is this huge increase in herbicide use that's started about a decade ago and has gotten worse and worse and worse each year . And now the -- the industry and the government has just approved the next generation of herbicide -tolerant crops that are now engineered to tolerate two of the riskiest old herbicide s that have been in use for a long time . You'll hear the word "2 ,4-D" and "Dicamba." This is definitely not a step in the right direction.</p><p end="2163" is_meta="false" speaker="Charles Benbrook" start="2102">So , we have to think about the totality of the impacts, including we have put so much energy as a country, and the industry has put most of its plant -breeding effort or eggs in the GE basket for these herbicide tolerant crops and BT crops . And there's a lot of other priorities that plant breeders have not focused on as seriously as they should have .</p><p end="2220" is_meta="false" speaker="Charles Benbrook" start="2163">And that is a cost of the technology . We're going to talk a lot about safety today . Rest assured there is no consensus about the safety of GE foods, and there are a number of reasons to be more concerned in 2014 than we were in 1996, the year that they were introduced, or in 2000 , which was about the time the adoption of herbicide tolerant soybeans was very high . And, really, with each passing year, as more and more GE plants are grown, as more herbicides are required to bring them to harvest, the list of both health concerns and environmental concerns is growing . And I'm sure we'll get back to them . There was a National Geographic, wonderful National Geographic series about the future of food the last year . And perhaps many of you read at least some of them.</p><p end="2280" is_meta="false" speaker="Charles Benbrook" start="2220">In the May 2014 issue of National Geographic, there was kind of a capstone piece that sort of presented a plan for ward -- to meet the needs of 9 billion people on an earth with shrinking resources . And this guy, Jonathan Foley, an academic from the University of Minnesota, he wrote a piece, "A Five -Step Plan to Feed the World." It's really a great piece . It's short . So, here's where his five steps, and I quote exactly how he states</p><p end="2280" is_meta="false" speaker="Charles Benbrook" start="2220">them . "Freeze agriculture's footprint." And by this, in his discussion, he's talking about,</p><p end="2280" is_meta="false" speaker="Charles Benbrook" start="2220">let's not clear any more tropical rainforests . Let's leave most of the wild lands wild .</p><p end="2280" is_meta="false" speaker="Charles Benbrook" start="2220">Second, " Grow more on the farms that we have." And this is absolutely right on. I mean, you know, in -- in the developed world, farmers, you know, ha rvest 150 to 250 bushels of corn, in Africa, you know, 40 to 60 .</p><p end="2342" is_meta="false" speaker="Charles Benbrook" start="2280">So , there's great potential around the world to raise the yields on the -- on farms that really have worn out soils, don't have access to a lot of input . So growing more on the</p><p end="2342" is_meta="false" speaker="Charles Benbrook" start="2280">farms we have is clearly a critical part of the solution . His -- Foley's third way to help feed the world, it was, "Us e resources more efficiently." This is kind of a no -brainer. It's -- it's something that obviously most of the agricultural inputs that today's corn,</p><p end="2342" is_meta="false" speaker="Charles Benbrook" start="2280">soybean and cotton farmers use are petroleum based . As the price of energy goes up,</p><p end="2342" is_meta="false" speaker="Charles Benbrook" start="2280">their prices is going to go up . And perhaps their availability will come into question . So ,</p><p end="2342" is_meta="false" speaker="Charles Benbrook" start="2280">obviously we have to use petroleum -based inputs more efficiently and water more efficiently . The fourth, a very imp ortant one: "Shift diets." Us Americans, people in Europe, we -- we eat very high on the hog .</p><p end="2408" is_meta="false" speaker="Charles Benbrook" start="2342">We eat a lot of mea t, and it takes a lot of food calories to produce a single calorie of beef, about 100 to 1.</p><p end="2408" is_meta="false" speaker="Charles Benbrook" start="2342">Thank you.</p><p end="2408" is_meta="false" speaker="Charles Benbrook" start="2342">Well, good.</p><p end="2408" is_meta="true" speaker="Charles Benbrook" start="2342">applause</p><p end="2517" is_meta="false" speaker="Charles Benbrook" start="2466">I've read essentially all the statements by various bodies . And here's what they essentially all say . They use slightly different words . They say the genetic engineering of food as a technology does not create any new or different potential risks in the modified foods that other forms of plant breeding don't.</p><p end="2587" is_meta="false" speaker="Charles Benbrook" start="2517">Several of the reports, including both of the two National Academy of S ciences reports that specifically address this say that there is a possibility that genetically engineered foods may pose higher risk of that nature, but we really don't know . They also all say t hat there's no convincing evidence now or at this point that there's been acute health problems in the U.S. population from the consumption of genetically engineered foods.</p><p end="2587" is_meta="false" speaker="Charles Benbrook" start="2517">And then they all go on to call for further investment in the development of more sensitive, scientific techniques to assess the possibil e risks, and they also call for post approval surveillance . Most of the recommendations for better science, more careful risk assessment and post market surveillance that have been made for over 15 years, in</p><p end="2587" is_meta="false" speaker="Charles Benbrook" start="2517">-- in the U.S .</p><p end="2587" is_meta="false" speaker="Robert Fraley" start="2517">So, first of all, you know, don't want to repeat what I said earlier, but, you know, this science is -- has been around literally since the 1970s and had broad applicability to</p><p end="2587" is_meta="false" speaker="Robert Fraley" start="2517">health and agriculture with an impressive safety record .</p><p end="2650" is_meta="false" speaker="Robert Fraley" start="2587">I mean, not a single issue of animal or human safety with the technology . That's because it's inherent that we've been moving genes from the beginning of time, but also, I just want to ill ustrate how important the regulatory oversight has been . Chuck and I first met when we put in place the USDA EPA and FDA oversight, which is still the gold standard around the world . But every country that we ship corn or soybeans to around the world has already done their independent health and safety assessments as well as literally thousands of academic studies that all point to the same conclusion that's been codified by every major science organization around the world.</p><p end="2650" is_meta="false" speaker="Robert Fraley" start="2587">These products are safe.</p><p end="2650" is_meta="false" speaker="Margaret Mellon" start="2587">No, I do not concede it.</p><p end="2650" is_meta="false" speaker="Margaret Mellon" start="2587">Yeah, sure.</p><p end="2767" is_meta="false" speaker="Margaret Mellon" start="2650">I think that there's a lot of review that's going on, and I think that it is focused on the point that I've just made, that there are no acute dramatic effects of the consumption of genetically modified organisms . All of those assessments have left open this notion --</p><p end="2767" is_meta="false" speaker="Margaret Mellon" start="2650">two things, one, that there could be subtle long term effects that we have not identified and that each application of genetic engineering needs to be looked at sepa rately. So,</p><p end="2767" is_meta="false" speaker="Margaret Mellon" start="2650">whatever you say about Roundup Ready crops, that says nothing about these new gene silencing technologies that are right up the way.</p><p end="2767" is_meta="false" speaker="Margaret Mellon" start="2650">So , a blanket assertion of safety isn't scientifically justified.</p><p end="2767" is_meta="false" speaker="Margaret Mellon" start="2650">19:33 :10</p><p end="2767" is_meta="false" speaker="Alison Van Eenennaam" start="2650">Sure, I mean, as a scientist like I would never make a blanket assertion about safety and I think it's very much dependent on each particular review . But I think that as a scientist I let the data tell me whether there are safety concerns . And after 20 years and thousands of studies and I feel the weight of the thousands of academic colleagues throughout the world that have done these safety studies --</p><p end="2767" is_meta="false" speaker="Alison Van Eenennaam" start="2650">-- that haven't found unique concerns that I have to accept the evidence for what it is and let the data tell me whether it's safe.</p><p end="2767" is_meta="false" speaker="Margaret Mellon" start="2650">-- but let's look at data like the kind that you've accumulated in your meta -analysis .</p><p end="2767" is_meta="false" speaker="Margaret Mellon" start="2650">You're looking at cows, cows that are killed whe n they are very young, maybe 14 or 15 months old, and you're drawing from the fact that there haven't been kind of increased c ondemnation rates at slaughter for cows over a long period of time.</p><p end="2767" is_meta="false" speaker="Margaret Mellon" start="2650">They're consuming the feed that's -- that is --</p><p end="2825" is_meta="false" speaker="Margaret Mellon" start="2767">Well, they're all -- I believe that Alison can tell us what she found in her study, but she just looked at the rates of condemnation when --</p><p end="2825" is_meta="false" speaker="Margaret Mellon" start="2767">-- [unintelligible] . I mean, when you get --</p><p end="2825" is_meta="false" speaker="Margaret Mellon" start="2767">-- what -- you -- if a -- if someone brings an obviously ill carcass to a slaughterhouse --</p><p end="2825" is_meta="false" speaker="Margaret Mellon" start="2767">-- right --</p><p end="2825" is_meta="false" speaker="Margaret Mellon" start="2767">-- they are not going to be allowed to sell it . And if you look at those rates and correlate them with -- you look at them over the time that we've been growing and that animals have been consuming this food, I think that's a valuable study and it tells you something .</p><p end="2825" is_meta="false" speaker="Margaret Mellon" start="2767">But it doesn't tell you very much. It certainly doesn't tell you about the effects of these crops even on animals who live a full lifetime.</p><p end="2825" is_meta="false" speaker="Margaret Mellon" start="2767">You need to do long term studies in animals, you need to do them progressively --</p><p end="2825" is_meta="false" speaker="Margaret Mellon" start="2767">-- and we, in fact, need protocols for how to do the kinds of studies that need to be done.</p><p end="2887" is_meta="false" speaker="Robert Fraley" start="2825">If you look at Alison's review, there's over two dozen long term animal studies that point to exactly the same answer, that these products are safe, and that's absolutely a fact.</p><p end="2887" is_meta="false" speaker="Robert Fraley" start="2825">And the same agencies that have reviewed all of this data are the same agencies that have reached t he same conclusi on on the gravity of science around global warming .</p><p end="2887" is_meta="false" speaker="Robert Fraley" start="2825">You know, you go to the National Academy, you go to all of the major organizations, at some point, you know, if -- consensus doesn't mean everybody agrees, it doesn't mean that there's a complete 100 per cent alignment just like there isn't on global warming,</p><p end="2887" is_meta="false" speaker="Robert Fraley" start="2825">but the science speaks for itself there, and the science has reached a consensus on this.</p><p end="2887" is_meta="false" speaker="Robert Fraley" start="2825">John Donvan:But, Chuck, you said that if you thought that you would go to the other side, that you're not ma rried to your position, that you're married to data, because they're saying they have much more data for their position than you do.</p><p end="2887" is_meta="false" speaker="Charles Benbrook" start="2825">A couple of really important points need to be made . The genetically engineered crops on the market today that are being planted by farmers and have been in the last few years are different from the genetically engineered crops that were planted in the early days .</p><p end="2945" is_meta="false" speaker="Charles Benbrook" start="2887">Rob Fraley and his colleagues have brought out a continuing series of improved mo re effective products . And one of the things that they've done is they've stacked multiple traits into a single corn . One of the big concerns in the scientific community is that the Cadillac GE corn that Monsanto has developed, it's called, "SmartStax," and it actually expresses eight different traits . There's six different Bt proteins that are expressed to control different insects and two genes that confer tolerance to Glyphosate Roundup herbicide and another herbicide called, "G lufosinate." Well, this mixing of eight different traits in this single genetically engineered corn plant raises some, you know,</p><p end="2945" is_meta="false" speaker="Charles Benbrook" start="2887">important scientific concerns, just like when you go to the doctor the doctor's going to ask you what drugs you've been -- what other medications you might be on before prescribing you something else for some other problem you may have .</p><p end="3006" is_meta="false" speaker="Charles Benbrook" start="2945">The regulatory agencies, the industry -- no one has done any serious research on the potential problems from these s tacked traits that are in today's GE food.</p><p end="3006" is_meta="false" speaker="Charles Benbrook" start="2945">[unintelligible] question.</p><p end="3006" is_meta="false" speaker="Alison Van Eenennaam" start="2945">Well, I mean, I guess, as a breeder, we routinely stack traits . We're always selecting for multiple traits going into the --</p><p end="3006" is_meta="false" speaker="Alison Van Eenennaam" start="2945">[inaudible] --</p><p end="3006" is_meta="false" speaker="Alison Van Eenennaam" start="2945">That's -- well --</p><p end="3006" is_meta="false" speaker="Alison Van Eenennaam" start="2945">-- it's breeding . You're always trying to improve multiple traits . And I think I need to understand the scientific kind of hypothesis, why stacked traits would be more dangerous when the individuals are not separate . I guess it's like looking at a broccolini,</p><p end="3006" is_meta="false" speaker="Alison Van Eenennaam" start="2945">and you know broccoli is safe and the other plant that was crossed -- why would a broccolini be more dangerous than its two parents?</p><p end="3065" is_meta="false" speaker="Alison Van Eenennaam" start="3006">So, what's your biological basis?</p><p end="3065" is_meta="false" speaker="Charles Benbrook" start="3006">The debate isn't about broccolini, it's about GM foods . And I'd like to get back to what Robert Fraley said about they're accepted around the world . I mean, Robert, you know about the problems your sister company, Syngenta, has now getting corn shipments into China . In fact, the corn industry is very concerned about the growing rejection of shipments in China and some other countr ies, because of unapproved traits. And in fact, we've been reading about ADM and Cargill, two of the largest grain companies in the United States -- have sued Syngenta . And there's, like, 50 lawsuits from farmers because of the lost income . So, it's really, I think, disingenuous to suggest that all over the world, all countries have opened their arms to GE crops, when, in fact, the trend --</p><p end="3065" is_meta="false" speaker="Charles Benbrook" start="3006">-- is [inaudible] --</p><p end="3065" is_meta="false" speaker="Robert Fraley" start="3006">So --</p><p end="3065" is_meta="false" speaker="Robert Fraley" start="3006">-- I'd be happy to respond to that, although it's, you know, someone else's product.</p><p end="3123" is_meta="false" speaker="Robert Fraley" start="3065">But I just want to come back to --</p><p end="3123" is_meta="false" speaker="Robert Fraley" start="3065">[inaudible] . I'll return to it . So, the question -- we got into this -- was --</p><p end="3123" is_meta="false" speaker="Robert Fraley" start="3065">-- [inaudible] --</p><p end="3123" is_meta="false" speaker="Robert Fraley" start="3065">I know you do a grea t job of it, John.</p><p end="3123" is_meta="false" speaker="Robert Fraley" start="3065">Perfect . That'd be -- that'd be great.</p><p end="3123" is_meta="false" speaker="Robert Fraley" start="3065">John Donvan:I just want -- I want t come to the point, because it's right in front o f us now, that --</p><p end="3123" is_meta="false" speaker="Robert Fraley" start="3065">Yeah.</p><p end="3123" is_meta="false" speaker="Robert Fraley" start="3065">Right . So --</p><p end="3123" is_meta="false" speaker="Robert Fraley" start="3065">Sure . So let's talk about it . So, the issue is, to get the products sold in the United States,</p><p end="3123" is_meta="false" speaker="Robert Fraley" start="3065">you get FDA, USDA, and EPA approval. But then you get the import approval from all the countries around the world. Syngenta got the approval for every country but China .</p><p end="3123" is_meta="false" speaker="Robert Fraley" start="3065">And China is notoriously slow in their regulatory process . And you know, there may be a little politics involved in this particular case . But they got 38 out of 39 import approvals,</p><p end="3123" is_meta="false" speaker="Robert Fraley" start="3065">and there's one more to go . And I know they've been working really hard to get that approval</p><p end="3181" is_meta="false" speaker="Robert Fraley" start="3123">And you know, it's unfortunate, when there's a market disruption. But it probably wouldn't surprise folks here to know that there's sometimes a little bit of politi cs and a little bit of mischief behind the scenes . And that's what's going on here.</p><p end="3181" is_meta="false" speaker="Margaret Mellon" start="3123">Well, I -- I mean, I think it's very important to note how much hassle -- trade hassle -- is associated with th e fact that the U.S. continues to embrace and push genetically -</p><p end="3181" is_meta="false" speaker="Margaret Mellon" start="3123">modified food on the rest of the world -- some of whom like it and many of whom don't.</p><p end="3181" is_meta="false" speaker="Margaret Mellon" start="3123">In fact, there's, I think, a billion dollars of lost sales as a result of this -- of this trade disruption that we're talking about. But that's just one of many. I mean, there have been contamination incidents of all kinds that have resulted in American crops being turned back . I mean, this is an expensive technology for us to push in today's worl d.</p><p end="3241" is_meta="false" speaker="Margaret Mellon" start="3181">It's amazing to me that the big grain traders, Cargill and --</p><p end="3241" is_meta="false" speaker="Charles Benbrook" start="3181">ADM.</p><p end="3241" is_meta="false" speaker="Margaret Mellon" start="3181">ADM, are suing the biotech companies . And they're suing them for huge amounts of money . I mean, this is -- this is serious business to them . They're losing them on a lot of money, and they're frankly not getting much in the way of --</p><p end="3241" is_meta="false" speaker="Margaret Mellon" start="3181">-- of benefits from the technology . So, I mean, I think it does signal that there is discomfort with technology around the world. Some of it may be --</p><p end="3241" is_meta="false" speaker="Margaret Mellon" start="3181">-- political, but it's sure [inaudible] --</p><p end="3241" is_meta="false" speaker="Robert Fraley" start="3181">Sure . So, just, you know, you said a lot about trade . Let me just make the point. 60 percent of the U.S . corn gets exported around the world and a third of our soybeans to markets that accept these products . We are the breadbasket to the world. It's unfortunate when there's a disruption, but it' s been really minor against the context of the benefits that these products have provided for food security.</p><p end="3301" is_meta="false" speaker="Robert Fraley" start="3241">The point I was trying to make on the safety studies is ea ch of these genes is regulated,</p><p end="3301" is_meta="false" speaker="Charles Benbrook" start="3241">Yes, that -- that's true . I mean, we --</p><p end="3301" is_meta="true" speaker="Charles Benbrook" start="3241">applause</p><p end="3301" is_meta="false" speaker="Charles Benbrook" start="3241">So , to have six different BT proteins in corn, the idea kind of goes back to the Frank Sinatra song, you know, if the right one don't get you, then the left one will . But the problem is we know that insects, they -- they have the ability -- once they develop resistance to one BT protein, it becomes much easier and quicker to develop resistance to others .</p><p end="3360" is_meta="false" speaker="Charles Benbrook" start="3301">And we now know, both in cotton insects and in corn insects, we've got corn root worms out there resistant to three of the six BT proteins in his corn already, and it's only been on the market for four years . So while having multiple BT proteins in there sort of sounds l ike a good idea, it's already not playing out as planned . And think about it. On an acre of corn, the six different BT protei ns add up to 3.7 pounds of the Bioinsecticide that's inside that corn. And that is allowing farmers to not use a tenth or perhaps 2/10 of a pound of a soil insecticide . So , how do you reduce pesticide use if you're replacing 2/10 of a pound --</p><p end="3360" is_meta="false" speaker="Charles Benbrook" start="3301">-- with 3.7 pounds.</p><p end="3482" is_meta="false" speaker="Alison Van Eenennaam" start="3420">-- moved to a safer herbicide.</p><p end="3482" is_meta="false" speaker="Margaret Mellon" start="3420">I just want to, you know, point out --</p><p end="3482" is_meta="false" speaker="Margaret Mellon" start="3420">-- that, for example, the -- the metastudy of the 147 other studies, none of those studies were done after the evolution of resistant organisms, of resistant insects.</p><p end="3482" is_meta="false" speaker="Margaret Mellon" start="3420">No . I'm sa ying that the good news stories about biotechnology crops -- and there are some -- are all from the early days . But we know that it is inevitable that resistance is going to develop. I also want to say -- and will undercut all of the benefits that we're talking about . I also want to say that the 147 studies really didn't -- they did prove that there were benefits to GM crops, but not to GM traits .</p><p end="3535" is_meta="false" speaker="Margaret Mellon" start="3482">They often compared one group of farmers, say, in India, who had adopted the technology, say a GM cotton technology with other farmers who hadn't. But the GM crops that were grown by the adopters were often much higher -- they'd been conventionally bred to have much improved genetics . And so what you were really comparing was better conventional g enetics and a BT crop to -- to kind of poore r genetics without a BT trait . And you know, that really says more about the importance of traditional breeding than it does about GE.</p><p end="3535" is_meta="false" speaker="Robert Fraley" start="3482">I don't think so.</p><p end="3535" is_meta="true" speaker="Robert Fraley" start="3482">talking simultaneously</p><p end="3605" is_meta="false" speaker="Margaret Mellon" start="3535">The way to do those studies, if you want to identify the role of the GE trait, is to take isolines that don't have the GE trait, have farmers grow them under the exact same conditio ns as other farmers who are growing those crops with the GE trait and then see whether there is --</p><p end="3605" is_meta="false" speaker="Margaret Mellon" start="3535">-- any difference in -- and those -- and the 147 studies [unintelligible].</p><p end="3605" is_meta="false" speaker="Alison Van Eenennaam" start="3535">That's actually -- I mean, that's what's done as part of the agronomic assessment of the performance of GM crops . But these were actual field studies done throughout the world by independent researchers looking at what the actual effects have been. And the effects have been --</p><p end="3605" is_meta="false" speaker="Margaret Mellon" start="3535">[unintelligible] I said, you've got to -- you've got to --</p><p end="3605" is_meta="false" speaker="Margaret Mellon" start="3535">--isolate the GE trait if you're going to give the GE trait credit.</p><p end="3605" is_meta="false" speaker="Charles Benbrook" start="3535">John asked about -- to open up a discussion of the environmental impacts . Roundup ready crops are grown now on --</p><p end="3605" is_meta="false" speaker="Charles Benbrook" start="3535">Okay, so a farmer has a field of corn, soybeans, cotton, and weeds come up . In the past,</p><p end="3605" is_meta="false" speaker="Charles Benbrook" start="3535">they had to spray ce rtain herbicides early in the season or cultivate the soil.</p><p end="3662" is_meta="false" speaker="Charles Benbrook" start="3605">But --</p><p end="3662" is_meta="false" speaker="Charles Benbrook" start="3605">Well, the -- roundup is Glyphosate herbicides . And in 1996, the first genetically engineered so -called herbicide tolerant crop came on the market . And scientists at Monsanto put a new gene into corn, soybeans, cotton and now other crops that makes it possible to spray to Glyphosate , which kills everything green that's growing . It would kill the corn without the gene . And so farmers can spray this broad spectrum herbicide,</p><p end="3662" is_meta="false" speaker="Charles Benbrook" start="3605">a very effective herbicide --</p><p end="3662" is_meta="false" speaker="Charles Benbrook" start="3605">Not kill the corn, but kill the weeds . But what's happened is in the early years, it worked great . But in 2000, in Delaware, in a soybean field, the first Glyphosate resistant weed --</p><p end="3662" is_meta="false" speaker="Charles Benbrook" start="3605">it was a Marestail, was created by Roundup ready soybeans . And scientists that warnedabout this happening before they were developed -- and even predicted it would take about five years -- there it was.</p><p end="3726" is_meta="false" speaker="Charles Benbrook" start="3662">Okay, so the industry -- okay, we better watch it . By 2004, we had six or eight different serious Glyphosate resistant weeds, mostly in the so utheast, including this Palmer A maranth that the roots of it -- the stock of it can get as big as a person's wrist. And it was breaking the cutter bars on cotton harvesting machines . And now there's like a hundred -- a hundred million acres --</p><p end="3726" is_meta="false" speaker="Charles Benbrook" start="3662">When you spray one herbicide over and over again on weeds, they're going to develop resistance.</p><p end="3726" is_meta="false" speaker="Robert Fraley" start="3662">Yeah, let me reel all the way back in terms of the herbicide tolerant crops and the benefits they provided. So, in the old days, when I was a kid growing up, I'd come home from school, I'd get on my dad's tractor, and we'd plow all the fields this time of year,</p><p end="3726" is_meta="false" speaker="Robert Fraley" start="3662">and we'd turn all the dirt over, and that was the method that people used to kill weeds.</p><p end="3783" is_meta="false" speaker="Robert Fraley" start="3726">The b ig benefit of Roundup ready crops is it gave farme rs the ability to use Roundup.</p><p end="3783" is_meta="false" speaker="Robert Fraley" start="3726">How many of you in the audience have ever used Roundup to control weeds ? I mean,</p><p end="3783" is_meta="false" speaker="Robert Fraley" start="3726">it's very effective . It's a very safe product. I t's generally regarded as the gold standard .</p><p end="3783" is_meta="false" speaker="Robert Fraley" start="3726">So it gave farmers a more environmentally friendly and a safer tool for controlling weeds . But the huge benefit, and absolutely the huge benefit of herbicide tolerant crops has been the fact that it has basically eliminated tillage . We don't plow fields any more . We don't expose that dirt to evaporation of the moisture . We don't have the erosion . We don't have the instan taneous release of greenhouse g asses when the flip the soil over. And since the adoption of herbicide tolerant crops in this country in the mid '90s, the rate of not plowing, of using conservation tillage has more than doubled.</p><p end="3783" is_meta="false" speaker="Robert Fraley" start="3726">That's a huge benefit.</p><p end="3841" is_meta="false" speaker="Robert Fraley" start="3783">Sure, absolutely . It's real simple . Evolution is alive and continues . And, frankly, you know, we're going to see, as I think we get into issues of climate change and changes in microenvironments, we'll probably see more evolution and more resistance . Here's a simple question: You've all heard of antibiotic resistance . It's a problem, right? You're aware of it . So what should drug companies do ? Should they not develop new antibiotics just because there's become a resistance to a n antibiotic? Absolutely not.</p><p end="3841" is_meta="false" speaker="Robert Fraley" start="3783">Roundup controls hundreds of weeds . In this country, 12 of them have become resistant . It still controls hundreds of w eeds. It needs to be used effectively . And,</p><p end="3841" is_meta="false" speaker="Robert Fraley" start="3783">Chuck, you were one of the first ones to point out that we should actually use combinations of herbicides . And that's what growers are doing today, and that's one of the benefits of being smarter and stewarding these products better.</p><p end="3841" is_meta="false" speaker="Charles Benbrook" start="3783">Rob, back when we had that conversation, I might have also suggested it's not a great idea to put antibiotics in plants . Do you remember that?</p><p end="3964" is_meta="false" speaker="Margaret Mellon" start="3909">Well, I mean, from my perspective the timescale, you know, is something like decades . I mean, in t he decades that we have seen herbicide tolerant crops we have seen a dramatic down ward effect on the monarchs as a result of Roundup killing the monarchs'</p><p end="3964" is_meta="false" speaker="Margaret Mellon" start="3909">only food --</p><p end="3964" is_meta="false" speaker="Margaret Mellon" start="3909">-- yes, I'm talking ab out Monarch butterflies . It turns out that it's called milkweed.</p><p end="3964" is_meta="false" speaker="Margaret Mellon" start="3909">Come on, you got to --</p><p end="3964" is_meta="false" speaker="Margaret Mellon" start="3909">I don't -- I wish I knew.</p><p end="4026" is_meta="false" speaker="Margaret Mellon" start="3964">But, you know, in that period of time the monarch population has decreased by almost 80 percent, and it is certainly because they've been deprived of their food, which is a milkweed . They're &#8211; we &#8217;re seeing effects on honeybees, on -- and they're all subtle effects, you know . It's not like killing the honeybees, it's making it impossible for the honeybee to find its way back to the ne st.</p><p end="4026" is_meta="false" speaker="Margaret Mellon" start="3964">Crayfish and earthworms, I mean, we are seeing effects right now that have ecological</p><p end="4026" is_meta="false" speaker="Margaret Mellon" start="3964">implications, so the timescale is not that great.</p><p end="4026" is_meta="false" speaker="Alison Van Eenennaam" start="3964">Yeah, I mean, I think you're conflating the technology with other issues . I don't -- the Monarch butterfly is due to more effective control s of the milkweed . And so if we want more weed then we should grow more weed, but the fact that we'r e controlling the weed more effectively --</p><p end="4026" is_meta="true" speaker="Alison Van Eenennaam" start="3964">laughter</p><p end="4026" is_meta="false" speaker="Alison Van Eenennaam" start="3964">Sorry.</p><p end="4081" is_meta="false" speaker="Alison Van Eenennaam" start="4026">You know, there's been no association with GMs and honeybees . I think that's just that,</p><p end="4081" is_meta="false" speaker="Alison Van Eenennaam" start="4026">that's a red herring out there --</p><p end="4081" is_meta="false" speaker="Margaret Mellon" start="4026">Well, there's -- there are --</p><p end="4081" is_meta="false" speaker="Alison Van Eenennaam" start="4026">-- and --</p><p end="4081" is_meta="true" speaker="Alison Van Eenennaam" start="4026">talking simultaneously</p><p end="4081" is_meta="false" speaker="Margaret Mellon" start="4026">What concerns me is that we're talking about problems that are associated with the technology without considering the benefits . And there're tradeoffs with every production system . And what we need to do is remov e the problems but retain the benefits, not just throw the technology out .</p><p end="4081" is_meta="false" speaker="Charles Benbrook" start="4026">What I'm concerned about, and many scientists --</p><p end="4081" is_meta="true" speaker="Charles Benbrook" start="4026">applause</p><p end="4081" is_meta="false" speaker="Charles Benbrook" start="4026">Charles Benbrook:-- is that GE crops came on the market in 1996 . Mon santo and Rob Fraley's very talented molec ular biologists. They're on their fifth generation now of genetically engineered corn . None of the GE corns that have been on the market have had a dominant position for more than five or six years .</p><p end="4143" is_meta="false" speaker="Charles Benbrook" start="4081">So , we are moving from one generation of GE crops to the next to the next before we've even begun to understand what the impacts of the first ones are . So, I would like to have the ability to at least do two crop rotation cycles, which might be six or eight years,</p><p end="4143" is_meta="false" speaker="Charles Benbrook" start="4081">to see how the farming system has responded, but in that time period, just that time period, the technology has changed. So , you never really get a handle on what has happened.</p><p end="4263" is_meta="false" speaker="Robert Fraley" start="4203">Because you asked the question, what kind of testing is required and what do we need to do ? And that's so relevant here, because the testing requirements are developed by the USDA, specifically to look at the evolution of pests and the impact on the environments . We do studies for several years to do the ana lysis that's being reviewed by the agencies for their environmental impacts . And that's one of the key questions.</p><p end="4263" is_meta="false" speaker="Robert Fraley" start="4203">The impact on the ecosystems, the -- on other species . That's all built into that regulatory system. And it's built on the fact that in t his country, we have been developing new crops from the beginning of time . New corn hybrids, new soybean varieties, new cotton varieties . And that experience from plant breeding has given us the insights and base the regulations in terms of how the GMO c rops are regulated.</p><p end="4263" is_meta="false" speaker="Robert Fraley" start="4203">Based on real, practical, real- world experience.</p><p end="4325" is_meta="false" speaker="Charles Benbrook" start="4263">We're not going to make any progress on that .</p><p end="4325" is_meta="true" speaker="Charles Benbrook" start="4263">laughter</p><p end="4381" is_meta="false" speaker="Charles Benbrook" start="4325">I would accept the battery of tests set out of by the Codex Alimentarius Commission,</p><p end="4381" is_meta="false" speaker="Charles Benbrook" start="4325">which is the internationally recognized body that sort of sets the testing rules for animal drugs, for pesticides, and other things.</p><p end="4445" is_meta="false" speaker="Charles Benbrook" start="4381">There was a six -year negotiation involving countries from around the world that defined the set of studies that should be done on each new genetically engineered food. I think it was sound then . It's still sound. And not a single GE food on the market today has been subjected to the battery of studies called for by Codex.</p><p end="4445" is_meta="false" speaker="Charles Benbrook" start="4381">And certainly not on the new GE [unintelligible].</p><p end="4445" is_meta="false" speaker="Robert Fraley" start="4381">Go ahead.</p><p end="4445" is_meta="false" speaker="Alison Van Eenennaam" start="4381">No, you take it.</p><p end="4445" is_meta="false" speaker="Robert Fraley" start="4381">So, generally, there's not alignment on those studies . Either their validity or their appropriateness for these types of products and there's not even recognition of that by the government agencies in this country . We comply to the laws of the United States and all the countries that we -- that, you know, import our crops . We are the breadbasket of the world . Two-thirds of the corn ships around the world to Europe, to Asia, and to other countries.</p><p end="4508" is_meta="false" speaker="Robert Fraley" start="4445">And the standard for safety is [unintelligible] --</p><p end="4508" is_meta="false" speaker="Robert Fraley" start="4445">Okay.</p><p end="4508" is_meta="false" speaker="Robert Fraley" start="4445">Thanks, John.</p><p end="4508" is_meta="false" speaker="Alison Van Eenennaam" start="4445">It's certainly not my area of expertise, but there are --</p><p end="4508" is_meta="false" speaker="Alison Van Eenennaam" start="4445">Okay.</p><p end="4508" is_meta="false" speaker="Alison Van Eenennaam" start="4445">Well --[laughter]</p><p end="4508" is_meta="false" speaker="Alison Van Eenennaam" start="4445">Okay.</p><p end="4508" is_meta="false" speaker="Alison Van Eenennaam" start="4445">Well, I guess, to me, it's, what are the unique risks that all these safety studies are for?</p><p end="4508" is_meta="false" speaker="Alison Van Eenennaam" start="4445">We're talking about a breeding method. And the data shows that there's no unique risks . And so we've -- we already do extensive studies that cost millions of dollars to bring these products to market. If we're going to do more studies, it'll be even more expensive. And I want to know what the unique risks ar e that we're looking for --</p><p end="4508" is_meta="false" speaker="Alison Van Eenennaam" start="4445">-- that are triggering these studies.</p><p end="4622" is_meta="false" speaker="Margaret Mellon" start="4561">First of all, the challenge of feeding the world's hungry people is not one that is met by production of any kind. I mean, if you want to feed hungry people around the world, I can give you a list of 10 things to do . You can build roads, you can raise their incomes,</p><p end="4622" is_meta="false" speaker="Margaret Mellon" start="4561">you can change the role of wom en, you can help people make their own decisions about what they want to grow, and help them grow it. So production itself is not an answer to the problems of hunger.</p><p end="4622" is_meta="true" speaker="Margaret Mellon" start="4561">applause</p><p end="4622" is_meta="false" speaker="Margaret Mellon" start="4561">But beyond that -- but beyond that, I want to say that, yo u know, that genetic engineering, as I tried to say in my original -- in my introductory remarks, is not really producing the kinds of traits that we need.</p><p end="4684" is_meta="false" speaker="Margaret Mellon" start="4622">Now, there -- I will just refer to one study in Nature magazine that was trying to help w ith a project . It started in 2010, trying to help African farmers develop corn crops that would grow on nitrogen poor soils . Now, in that period of time, that project has been able to produce 21 conventionally bred varieties of corn, adapted around Afric a, that grow better in their nitrogen poor soils . Genetic engineering, which was also used, has produced one . And they don't think it'll be ready for 10 years.</p><p end="4684" is_meta="false" speaker="Robert Fraley" start="4622">First of all, thanks for that . I was going to say that we might actually have reached --</p><p end="4684" is_meta="false" speaker="Robert Fraley" start="4622">reached some alignment . We've talked a lot about our differences . And one of the points I wanted to make -- you cited the National Geographic . I give that same speech all t he time . I absolutely believe that, you know, this is a complicated challenge, of feeding the world.</p><p end="4741" is_meta="false" speaker="Robert Fraley" start="4684">It's going to take increased productivity and efficiencies, and that's clear, and that's where these tools come into play . It's also important that we reduce food waste . And,</p><p end="4741" is_meta="false" speaker="Robert Fraley" start="4684">you know, there's things that we can do by protecting crops or providing refrigeration and diets . I absolutely agree . It's a complicated question that will take all the tools we have.</p><p end="4741" is_meta="false" speaker="Margaret Mellon" start="4684">And would you agre e that we can't --</p><p end="4741" is_meta="false" speaker="Robert Fraley" start="4684">Excuse me . Let me --</p><p end="4741" is_meta="false" speaker="Margaret Mellon" start="4684">-- use 40 percent of our corn for ethanol?</p><p end="4741" is_meta="false" speaker="Robert Fraley" start="4684">Can we -- we can address that if you want to . But let me just -- let me complete my thoughts . Food security challenge is the biggest challenge we face . We have to double the available food in 36 years . It's important that we make the right decisions today .</p><p end="4741" is_meta="false" speaker="Robert Fraley" start="4684">The other important point on farming -- and we've talked a lot about small farmers . My mentor was a guy named Dr. Nor man Borlaug. And Norman always made the point that if you help a farmer, you help poverty . 70 percent of the world's poor are farmers.</p><p end="4802" is_meta="false" speaker="Robert Fraley" start="4741">If you give them better tools to farm even incrementally better, you address not only poverty, but you address food security . And so these are all complex interrelated issues .</p><p end="4802" is_meta="false" speaker="Robert Fraley" start="4741">There are no simple solutions . But I think we should play the game with all of our tools.</p><p end="4802" is_meta="false" speaker="Charles Benbrook" start="4741">I f you're persuaded that the argument from the biotech industry, that this technology is essential to feed the world, if this is what really grabs your interest in this, ask yourself this question: You have a 50-pound bag that you can get to a poor African farmer,</p><p end="4802" is_meta="false" speaker="Charles Benbrook" start="4741">trying to grow maize on worn -out soils.</p><p end="4868" is_meta="false" speaker="Charles Benbrook" start="4802">You can give that farmer a 50 -pound bag of nitrogen fertilizer, or you can give him a 50 -</p><p end="4868" is_meta="false" speaker="Charles Benbrook" start="4802">pound bag with smart stack corn . Now, I think Robb Fraley would agree to me that African farmer's going to get a bigger boost out of the 50 pounds of nitrogen than out of his magic seeds.</p><p end="4868" is_meta="false" speaker="Alison Van Eenennaam" start="4802">Can -- can I --</p><p end="4868" is_meta="false" speaker="Margaret Mellon" start="4802">I don't think you have to choose one -- either one or the other, either . But I do think it's very important to kind of get the power of the technologies in perspective in order to make the right decisions about where to put our money going forward.</p><p end="4926" is_meta="false" speaker="Margaret Mellon" start="4868">And right now I think we have too much faith in genetic engineering, which as I said, has not -- it really hasn't proven itself except in one instance . So , I do think it's important that we face that. I also want to say how, you no he, we need to use all our tools . I want to give a shout -out to traditional breeding . I mean, since , or well before genetic engineering came on the scene, traditional bre eders and agronomists were able to produce 1 to 2 percent a year increases in corn and soybean yields in this country for decades . It happened before biotech. All the way through the biotech era, we have continued to get 1 to 2 percent yields decade after decade .</p><p end="4981" is_meta="false" speaker="Margaret Mellon" start="4926">And we would continue to get them if we weren't usin g genetic engineering sometime in the future . So, we need to acknowledge how important that technology is. And it is not getting the attention that it deserves . I mean --</p><p end="4981" is_meta="false" speaker="Alison Van Eenennaam" start="4926">Yes.</p><p end="4981" is_meta="false" speaker="Robert Fraley" start="4926">Let me take a quick response.</p><p end="4981" is_meta="false" speaker="Robert Fraley" start="4926">I had -- you know, we're dangerously close to common ground here . I absolutely believe everything you said . In fact, let me just tell you a little bit of a secret . You know, I run the research program for Monsanto . We spend exactly twice as much of our researchdollars on plant breeding as we do on biotech . Absolutely plant breeding particularly assisted by these molecular tools has a great opportunity and has a huge impact internationally . We work with the Gates Foundation to use these tools to breed -- to breed drought resistant maize for Africa, and we're working wit h them on other projects so I couldn't agree more.</p><p end="5040" is_meta="false" speaker="Robert Fraley" start="4981">You know, I think the debate around GMO crops sucks all the air out of the room.</p><p end="5040" is_meta="true" speaker="Robert Fraley" start="4981">applause</p><p end="5040" is_meta="false" speaker="Robert Fraley" start="4981">I think we're to the point where it's become a side show . It's become a distraction.</p><p end="5040" is_meta="false" speaker="Alison Van Eenennaam" start="4981">Well, for example, we --</p><p end="5040" is_meta="false" speaker="Alison Van Eenennaam" start="4981">-- wheat tends to be done by public breeders . And I know that the public breeders are using conventional selection and are basically locked out of using GM as a -- it's a synergistic tool . It can be used for very specific things like disease resistance much more effectively, potentially . And combining the two together would be a really beneficial thing . And so I just don't see it as being mutually exclusive . You have to do conv entional breeding or genetic engineer ing.</p><p end="5103" is_meta="false" speaker="Alison Van Eenennaam" start="5040">Margaret Mellon:I agree with that, but I also -- I mean, every time I hear about what genetic engineering is going to do, I always remember the promises that I've been hearing for decades,</p><p end="5103" is_meta="false" speaker="Alison Van Eenennaam" start="5040">many of which have never come to fruition.</p><p end="5103" is_meta="false" speaker="Alison Van Eenennaam" start="5040">Well, there are certainly products in the pipeline that have been delivered and things like the disease resistant papaya. And I guess as a public sector scientist I get a little bit frustrated by the same groups that are out there kind of scaremongering about the technology or at the same time saying, "Why hasn't anything come to market?" because it's really that, that's stopping the public sector from developing these products.</p><p end="5103" is_meta="true" speaker="Alison Van Eenennaam" start="5040">applause</p><p end="5162" is_meta="false" speaker="Charles Benbrook" start="5103">A lot of cotton farmers in the Southeast have devoted with their operations that aren't growing cotton anymore . They can't deal with the resistant weeds . There's three or four different Glyphosate resistant weeds in a lot of the cotton acreage in the Southeast . And there's grave concern in the Midwest that the same fate will occur in the Midwest where we -- you know, we grow all -- most of the corn and soybeans . Corn and soybeans are the backbone of the U.S . food system, and if we have a weed --</p><p end="5162" is_meta="false" speaker="Charles Benbrook" start="5103">resistant weed meltdown in the Midwest it'll be a serious national problem.</p><p end="5162" is_meta="false" speaker="Robert Fraley" start="5103">Could you restate the question?</p><p end="5226" is_meta="true" speaker="Robert Fraley" start="5162">laughter</p><p end="5226" is_meta="false" speaker="Robert Fraley" start="5162">I think only if we stop investing in the science in the future . You know, absolutely, you know, I've mentioned in my openi ng remarks, you know, concern over resistance development is a concern that's been a concern from the beginning of time . But we have incredible tools . I'm actually proud of the fact that we are developing our third and fourth generation technologies and staying ahead of the curve . And if we can move forward with the science and all of the tools -- I mean, we need to make the advances in breeding, we need to make the advances in biotechnology, tremendous opportunity for precision agricultural tools to farm more smartly, we're going to need all of these tools .</p><p end="5226" is_meta="false" speaker="Robert Fraley" start="5162">We have to double the food supply in 36 years . What wakes me up in the morning is I know we can do it if we can reach alignment on moving forward and using the common ground .</p><p end="5290" is_meta="false" speaker="Robert Fraley" start="5226">We all care about food security . We all care about the environment . Let's get smart and move forward.</p><p end="5290" is_meta="false" speaker="Alison Van Eenennaam" start="5226">This past week the U.S . celebrated Thanksgiving, a wonderful holiday, and we had 14 people over t o our house. And as the hostess my task was to serve a safe delicious meal. You know the drill, keeping the raw turkey out of contact with food surfaces,</p><p end="5290" is_meta="false" speaker="Alison Van Eenennaam" start="5226">making sure you cook it enough to get rid of food borne illness but not so much as to be dry, all wh ile drinking a glass of wine which probably added to the risks .</p><p end="5345" is_meta="false" speaker="Alison Van Eenennaam" start="5290">But actually food poisoning is a real risk, and 3,000 people a year die of food poisoning .</p><p end="5345" is_meta="false" speaker="Alison Van Eenennaam" start="5290">As we gave thanks for this abundant cornucopia, the one risk I was not concerned about was whether any of the food was genetically modified . And I was serving this meal to the people I love most in the world, my dearest friends, my husband, my two teenage sons. Their wellbeing is of paramount importance to me . And as a parent it's my resp onsibility to use the best possible information to protect their health and to determine what the scientific consensus is on technology . That is why my kids drink pasteurized milk and have had all of their childhood vaccinations . Sometimes the risks that concern people and the risks that kill people are entirely different. For too long the debate over the merits of genetically modified food has focused on unrealized hypothetical risks and has been conflated with the use of pesticides .</p><p end="5405" is_meta="false" speaker="Alison Van Eenennaam" start="5345">It has not addressed how GM could help with the very real risks faced by the hungry and malnourished . There are costs associated to excessive precaution . Doing nothing is doing something . During the 90 minutes we've had this debate, approximately 1,500 people died of hunger, more than all of you here in this room. Hunger and malnutrition are real risks, risks that kill over 20,000 people daily . And most of those who die are children . These are not talking points; they're people . As a mother and a scientist , what concerns me is the fear -mongering campaign against genetically -modified food has forced [unintelligible] scientists from using this breeding method to help produce more nutritious and sustainable food sources for millions of people . Vote yes for GM food.</p><p end="5405" is_meta="false" speaker="Alison Van Eenennaam" start="5345">John Donvan:Thank you, Alison Van Eenennaam.</p><p end="5405" is_meta="true" speaker="Alison Van Eenennaam" start="5345">applause</p><p end="5464" is_meta="false" speaker="Charles Benbrook" start="5405">Unfortunately, the way that the GE technology and crop revolution has unfolded, it's really turned into kind of an arms race with weeds, using herbicides as the sole hammer.</p><p end="5464" is_meta="false" speaker="Charles Benbrook" start="5405">And as a result, we've had this spread of resistant weeds . And also, the rapid --</p><p end="5464" is_meta="false" speaker="Charles Benbrook" start="5405">especially in the last 10 years, escalation in the use of herbicides . There may have been 100 million pounds or so of insecticides not applied since 1996 because of BT corn and</p><p end="5464" is_meta="false" speaker="Charles Benbrook" start="5405">cotton, but there's been 6 or 700 million more pounds of herbicides . Now, the word "pesticide" encompasses both herbicides and insecticides . So, if you've reduced insecticide use by 100 million pounds -- and that's a good thing -- but herbicide use has gone up by 600 million plus pounds, how do you come up with pesticide use going down ? It's just not true .</p><p end="5526" is_meta="false" speaker="Charles Benbrook" start="5464">And a lot of farmers would take considerable exception to the claims from the other side of the die here about pesticide use going down, and their job being easier. In 1995,</p><p end="5526" is_meta="false" speaker="Charles Benbrook" start="5464">the year before the GE revolution, there was about 27 million pounds of Glyphosate applied by farmers in American agriculture . 10 years later, it had gone up to 157 million pounds . And in 2014, USDA data shows pretty clear, it's about 230 million pounds of Glyphosate was applied . We have about 300 million acres of cultivated croplands, so we're talking about two -thirds of a pound of Glyphosate herbicide -- if it was spread evenly across the United States -- cou ld be applied on every acre of cropland. That's why we've got Glyphosate in our blood, in our hair . That's why we have -- the scientists are concerned, even though it's generally regarded as a relatively safe pesticide, there is reason for serious worry here.</p><p end="5580" is_meta="false" speaker="Robert Fraley" start="5526">Thanks for a great debate and for listening to the commentary . I hope it's helped provide you more insight into the important science and the important tools that GMOs represent . What I'd like to do is actually highlight what a vote against the motion really means, what it would be like to live in a world without GMO crops, what that would look like . First thing, there'd be a significant impact to the land. Without GMOs,</p><p end="5580" is_meta="false" speaker="Robert Fraley" start="5526">farmers would need to dramatically increase their use of herbicides and insecticides . I estimate it to be about 100 million pounds added to the environment each year .</p><p end="5580" is_meta="false" speaker="Robert Fraley" start="5526">Second, since GMOs improved yields and helped farmers deliv er more food in their absence means we're going to have to farm more land.</p><p end="5646" is_meta="false" speaker="Robert Fraley" start="5580">And you k now, it's going to take about 12 0 million acres more land to just keep where we are today . That's about one California or four New York states . And the pressure that will put on will mean -- it will drain more wetlands, will cut down more fores ts.</p><p end="5646" is_meta="false" speaker="Robert Fraley" start="5580">We'll look at more prairielands, because people will fundamentally eat . Third, voting against the GMO technology really means exacerbating climate change, because it means we go backwards . We have to manufacture more chemicals . We have to take trac tors and run up and down the fields and plow, and we release more greenhouse gas emissions . Banning GMO crops is equivalent to taking and putting 26 million new cars on the road from a greenhouse perspective . It also means higher food prices. North Caro lina State just published a study showing that the average family going in -- not using GMO crops adds about $3,000 a year to their food bill. And that impacts everybody, and we all bear the cost of that. And finally, voting against GMOs means forgoing a ll those opportunities that Dr . Van Eenennaam had talked about. You know,</p><p end="5646" is_meta="false" speaker="Robert Fraley" start="5580">it's a relatively new technology . The future is ahead of us.</p><p end="5701" is_meta="false" speaker="Robert Fraley" start="5646">We're at the tip of the iceberg stage in what's possible . So, I hope, for the sake of all of our families -- and I hope for the sake of all the people on the planet -- that you vote to keep all of our options open and vote yes to support GM food. Thank you.</p><p end="5701" is_meta="false" speaker="Margaret Mellon" start="5646">You know, we really haven't heard a single pi ece of evidence tonight that supports the notion that somehow genetically engineered crops are important for helping hungry people eat . And I think that's really -- there is no evidence for that. If there is a consensus study out there, it's the World Ba nk consensus study that GE crops are not important to solve food security problems .</p><p end="5765" is_meta="false" speaker="Margaret Mellon" start="5701">If you want to know what the world would look like without GE, you might want to look at Europe . Europe has an incredibly productive agriculture, so much so that they're all paying, you know, subsidies just like we're paying . They have a -- I would say they're still using too much in the way of herbicides and pesticides, but it's a very productive, safe and capable agriculture system that we would all be, I t hink, very comfortable to live in .</p><p end="5765" is_meta="false" speaker="Margaret Mellon" start="5701">We have to look at the fact that there are still safety concerns about this technology,</p><p end="5765" is_meta="false" speaker="Margaret Mellon" start="5701">particularly about the long term effects . And that's when the American cancer society says . Yes, the current products are safe, but the long -term concerns are still out there .</p><p end="5819" is_meta="false" speaker="Margaret Mellon" start="5765">So , we can't pretend that those issues have been thrown away . I think we can say that since genetic engineering has been introduced, it has simply failed to address the big problems that are out there, the problems that are leading to dead zones in the Gulf of Mexico, but that there are technologies that can do that, and they are traditional breeding and Agroecology , which have not gotten enough discussion, so --</p><p end="5819" is_meta="false" speaker="Margaret Mellon" start="5765">I urge you to vote against it.</p><p end="5819" is_meta="true" speaker="Margaret Mellon" start="5765">a pplause</p></transcript></debate>
