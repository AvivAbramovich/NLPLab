Let me first tell you that I must say in response to your discussion about the title of this debate, about the proposition itself, I was a little bit uptight about it originally because, after all, we are debating this issue here in New York City a few miles from Ellis Island. And I have been -- I have participated in things in the past that have been a little bit skewed, and I can recall a spoof of me, a debate -- or actually it was supposed to be a little discussion between me and Vincente Fox, but it was a spoof on "Saturday Night Live," and so they had someone who looked like -- and I knew it was biased from the beginning, from the very beginning because the guy playing me looked like me and the guy playing Vincente Fox was Antonio Banderas --</p><p end="481" is_meta="true" speaker="Tom Tancredo" start="419">laughter</p><p end="481" is_meta="false" speaker="Tom Tancredo" start="419">No fair, come on, guys.</p><p end="538" is_meta="false" speaker="Tom Tancredo" start="481">Frankly, I -- you look at it and begin to think about the ramifications of immigration, both legal and illegal, and they are fascinating. It is really one of the most intellectually stimulating areas of public policy I think we can possibly talk about.</p><p end="538" is_meta="false" speaker="Tom Tancredo" start="481">A great deal of mythology has built up around the Statue of Liberty, around the Emma Lazarus poem, and a lot of that mythology, of course, is just that. It's mythology. But unfortunately we have a tendency in the United States, we look back sort of nostalgically at a period of time because most of us are either children of or grandchildren of immigrants, and so the whole idea of immigration has a sort of a nostalgic appeal to us,</p><p end="538" is_meta="false" speaker="Tom Tancredo" start="481">and that's our first thought usually. And I am the same way. I am the grandson of Italian immigrants, came right here into Ellis Island.</p><p end="602" is_meta="false" speaker="Tom Tancredo" start="538">And my parents being first generation Americans were very, very strict about one thing and that was to become an American, to become -- and it meant a lot of things to them in different ways, and I'll get to it in a minute, except that I do want you to understand I have that same nostalgic opinion to a large extent of what our immigration policy was,</p><p end="602" is_meta="false" speaker="Tom Tancredo" start="538">but we can't confuse that and make -- and develop true policy today based on mythology and, you know, some of the myths that we have to dispel. I think tonight's a good place to do it, it&#8217;s -- first of all the Statue of Liberty was not a gift from France that was designed to explore the wonderful idea of open immigration. Indeed it had nothing to do with immigration policy. It had everything to do with extolling the virtues of a republic.</p><p end="602" is_meta="false" speaker="Tom Tancredo" start="538">In fact, the statue was called &#8220;Liberty Enlightening the World.&#8221; It was not called &#8220;Liberty Inviting the World.&#8221; As for the Emma Lazarus poem, it was added 30 years after the statue got here.</p><p end="663" is_meta="false" speaker="Tom Tancredo" start="602">And it was about that time that the author of the poem, Ms. Lazarus, was talking about the need to limit immigration to various groups. Remember also that a lot of the tired,</p><p end="663" is_meta="false" speaker="Tom Tancredo" start="602">and poor, and huddled masses got stamped &#8220;return to sender" here at Ellis Island. There were people with dangerous elements and ailments like pinkeye or a cough or fever, and if anyone exhibited any degree of exhaustion by climbing the very steep stairway over at Ellis Island which was purposely built that way, that was one of the things that could get you sent home. It was not a take all comers time in American history. As for the poor,</p><p end="663" is_meta="false" speaker="Tom Tancredo" start="602">well, long before the Ellis Island experience, the colonies had enacted very, very stringent regulations about this particular aspect of immigration policy.</p><p end="717" is_meta="false" speaker="Tom Tancredo" start="663">In New York in 1691, it required an immigrant to have, quote, "A visible estate or manual occupation or give a sufficient surety that he shall not be a burden or a charge to the respective place that he shall come to inhabit." In 1996 in the Congress of the United States, they tried to actually expand on this and say that you had to have an affidavit signed by someone if you&#8217;re coming here, you had to have an affidavit of support. They put it in, it was part of the Welfare Reform Bill, never, not one time, never has it been enforced. And so the fact is we are in a -- unfortunately, we are importing a large degree of poverty into the United States. The National Academy of Sciences along with the Center for Immigration studies shows that welfare use, the rates for welfare use, are significantly higher for immigrant households than they are for nonimmigrant households.</p><p end="780" is_meta="false" speaker="Tom Tancredo" start="717">Federation for Immigration Reform could identify a net cost, net cost after taxes were paid by illegal immigrants, they were just focusing on that one part, a net cost to American taxpayers of over $150 billion annually. Now, my point here is to show that for a long period of time in American history, we had what I would think was, and believe, is a rational policy. It was rational for us to bring in a lot of people, especiallyduring the hay-day of American immigration, the 1890s and 1900s, a lot of people who were low-skill, low-wage people. Why? Because, of course, we were building the Industrial Revolution here. They were fueling it. That was appropriate. It was right. It served purpose for the people coming and it served a purpose for the people here. I hope -- well, also, as I see we&#8217;re getting toward the end of that 7-minute period, there is another myth I want to try to dispel quickly.</p><p end="840" is_meta="false" speaker="Tom Tancredo" start="780">And that is that immigration has always been sort of a straight-line increase from the time America started until today, that it&#8217;s always just been going up. Absolutely untrue.</p><p end="840" is_meta="false" speaker="Tom Tancredo" start="780">About 1830 is when immigration began to be statistically relevant in the United States. It started to climb. By 1850, it started to go down. Around 1880, it grew. Around 1890, it declined. It rose dramatically right before the First World War, but declined dramatically after the First World War with the Immigration Act of 1924. It stayed relatively low for a long period of time until, as a matter of fact, 1965, when everything changed with the Immigration Act that was pushed by Senator Kennedy at the time, Senator Teddy Kennedy. And we&#8217;ve had now really massive immigration, low-skill, low-wage workers ever since that period of time.</p><p end="901" is_meta="false" speaker="Tom Tancredo" start="840">Now whether or not those -- that cyclical movement and that cyclical characterization I just gave you of immigration was purposeful or not. It had and served a good purpose, I think. We had periods of high immigration. We had periods of low immigration. And you know what happened during the periods of low immigration? People used that time to assimilate. And let me tell you, from my point of view, this is by far the most important aspect of the debate. Assimilation -- we can have massive amounts of immigration to this country, the right time and the right type of immigration, especially,</p><p end="901" is_meta="false" speaker="Tom Tancredo" start="840">as I say, depending upon our needs here as long as we have assimilation along with it.</p><p end="901" is_meta="false" speaker="Tom Tancredo" start="840">Or, if it doesn&#8217;t happen along with it, it has to happen at that period of time that we take a break, which is not a bad idea for us to think about even now, because assimilation is not occurring.</p><p end="959" is_meta="false" speaker="Tom Tancredo" start="901">It&#8217;s not occurring to the extent -- I mean, I know you can&#8217;t categorically say that, but it is certainly not occurring to the extent that we need it to in this country. We desperately need, perhaps more than any country in the world, we need things to hold us together, to think about as being Americans, to connect together, not pull us apart. And I&#8217;m afraid our immigration policy is doing just that.</p><p end="1496" is_meta="false" speaker="Kris Kobach" start="1441">Pennsylvania.</p><p end="1496" is_meta="false" speaker="Kris Kobach" start="1441">Well, I'm making plenty of noise there too.</p><p end="1496" is_meta="false" speaker="Kris Kobach" start="1441">Thank you. My work in terms of immigration policy at the national level began in 2001 when I served as counsel to John Ashcroft at the Justice Department. And after I left the Justice Department in 2003, I left with a very important idea in my head and that was that the rule of law has broken down in immigration, and much had to be done to restore it.</p><p end="1496" is_meta="false" speaker="Kris Kobach" start="1441">But it had to be done not only at the national level, but also at the state level. And that's why I got involved helping states like Arizona and many other states.</p><p end="1561" is_meta="false" speaker="Kris Kobach" start="1496">In 2007 for the first time, every state in the country saw legislation introduced into the state legislature to, in some way, restrict or slow down the pace of immigration into that state. Not all of them passed, but that's an important point. Every state is a border state now. The reason that nearly all of the states on the map are trying to take steps to discourage illegal immigration is several-fold. But the number one driver is a very important point in this debate, and I'd like to start there. The fiscal cost, fiscal cost, the cost to governments, to taxpayers to the illegal immigration in particular is unsustainable.</p><p end="1561" is_meta="false" speaker="Kris Kobach" start="1496">My point can be summarized in one sentence by Nobel laureate, Milton Friedman. He said, it's just obvious. You can't have open immigration and a welfare state. You can't have open immigration and a welfare state. Now, my guess is that there are a few fans of the welfare state here in the audience. I am not a big fan myself, I accept the reality that it's here to stay. And given that reality, there is an important distinction that needs to be made between the current wave of immigration, which started in the '80s and has been going unabated for three decades, and all preceding waves of immigration.</p><p end="1621" is_meta="false" speaker="Kris Kobach" start="1561">They were not immigrating into a welfare state. They were immigrating into a situation where they rose or they fell based on their own merits. There was no safety net to catch them. That is a critical distinction that changes everything. When Emma Lazarus wrote that poem, she spoke of a lady holding the golden -- the lamp by the golden door. Now,</p><p end="1621" is_meta="false" speaker="Kris Kobach" start="1561">the golden door she was referring to was a golden door of opportunity. You come here,</p><p end="1621" is_meta="false" speaker="Kris Kobach" start="1561">you're free to do whatever you can. You make it or you lose it, but it's all up to you.</p><p end="1621" is_meta="false" speaker="Kris Kobach" start="1561">Now that golden door represents goodies, public benefits, services that are available to people who come to the United States more than any other nation in the Western hemisphere. The golden door represents something completely different. Now, aliens are consuming those benefits far more than U.S. citizens are doing so. Now, the average per household consumption -- that consumption of public services and benefits, is estimated, from a 2007 figure, not 1993 numbers, 2007, to be $19,400 per year net.</p><p end="1680" is_meta="false" speaker="Kris Kobach" start="1621">They're consuming -- and this is all immigrants, the illegal and legal combined. 19,400 per year more in services than they're paying it in taxes. So that's a net drag on the fiscal status of the country. Now, Juli&#225;n mentioned this 1993 study. I have not seen that study.</p><p end="1680" is_meta="false" speaker="Kris Kobach" start="1621">That is so old I wouldn't even know where to begin because the numbers are so different back then. Now we're talking 11.3 million illegal aliens in the country. There was also a study that came out last month based on census figures from 2010, and the number was generated by the Center for Immigration Studies, crunching the numbers, 71 percent of illegal alien households are consuming some form of welfare, 52 percent of lawfully present alien-headed households are consuming some form of welfare, in contrast to only 39 percent of the U.S. citizen-headed households are consuming some form of welfare.</p><p end="1680" is_meta="false" speaker="Kris Kobach" start="1621">Now, the explanation for this is obvious. It has nothing to do with ethnicity or nationality, it has everything to do with economics and demographics. Poor people are more likely to consume welfare.</p><p end="1743" is_meta="false" speaker="Kris Kobach" start="1680">And immigrants coming into the United States, especially illegal immigrants, are almost in all cases having less than a high school education. If you look at all immigrants combined, about two-thirds have a high school education or less, and so we are importing a very impoverished set of immigrants, both legal and illegal, into the country. Here's another fact to chew on. The Mexico-American border has the greatest disparity in income levels of any border on the planet. There is no other national border where the difference between the rich country and the poor country per capita is greater. That fuels a lot of this fiscal cost, too. So since 1996, Congress has passed laws trying to discourage this handing out of public benefits because it exacerbates the problem. Most states have ignored that law. New York is one of the states that continues to give public benefits to illegal aliens. New York also gives in-state tuition rates to certain illegal aliens. Think about that if you are a --[applause]</p><p end="1743" is_meta="false" speaker="Kris Kobach" start="1680">-- well, I don't think any of the out-of-state students who are at a public institution are clapping right now because they're paying out-of-state tuition rates.</p><p end="1803" is_meta="false" speaker="Kris Kobach" start="1743">Now, the -- nationwide, as Tom mentioned, it's over $100 billion a year net that is flowing out to illegal aliens, that is to say, they're consuming that much more in benefits than they're paying in taxes. And the burden falls overwhelmingly at the states. Indeed, I like to say illegal immigration is the ultimate unfunded federal mandate because the federal government, which is chiefly responsible for enforcing the laws, fails to do so,</p><p end="1803" is_meta="false" speaker="Kris Kobach" start="1743">and then the states have to pay the burden. You can think of story after story about this.</p><p end="1803" is_meta="false" speaker="Kris Kobach" start="1743">Hazelton, Pennsylvania, one of the cities that I'm representing, they saw their population explode from 20,000 in the year 2000 to about 30,000 five years later, 50 percent increase in population, but they get most of their revenue from an earned income tax and their revenue remained flat. Population goes up 50 percent, no additional tax revenue, that was because most of the additional people coming in were working at a meat packing plant nearby, were illegal aliens, and they were either earning too little income to pay any taxes or they were earning purely cash income.</p><p end="1863" is_meta="false" speaker="Kris Kobach" start="1803">And the city wasn't getting any revenues. Look what happened. All the costs to the city went up 50 percent, all the costs contingent on population. The school districts, the budget was breaking, English as a Second Language, the expenditures in 2002 were 136,000 that year. In 2006, they went up to 1.1 million. Talk about that kind of burden on a small town school district. The same thing is happening at the national level. And as a result, we have to recognize that there is a fiscal cost. Or take it on the individual level. Look at the jobs. There are 14 million Americans out of work. A vast majority of the 11.3 illegal -- million illegal aliens have those jobs, about seven million are in the workforce. Many states are realizing the simple truth, if you want to create a real job for a U.S. citizen tomorrow, deport an illegal alien today. It actually works.</p><p end="1863" is_meta="true" speaker="Kris Kobach" start="1803">applause</p><p end="1863" is_meta="false" speaker="Kris Kobach" start="1803">But of course many of you are probably thinking, and I'm sure we'll hear from the other side, that those are jobs Americans won't do, that those are jobs that are too low on the totem pole for Americans to do.</p><p end="1918" is_meta="false" speaker="Kris Kobach" start="1863">Well, the statistics don't bear that out because in every single one of the industry --</p><p end="1918" is_meta="false" speaker="Kris Kobach" start="1863">industrial sectors where illegal aliens are prominent, U.S. citizens still have the majority of jobs there, 74 percent of construction workers, U.S. citizens, 76 percent of food preparation workers, U.S. citizens, 56 percent of agriculture laborers, U.S. citizens. TheU.S. citizens are there, and they're working right alongside the illegal aliens who are depressing the wages or taking their jobs outright. So if we care about our fiscal health,</p><p end="1918" is_meta="false" speaker="Kris Kobach" start="1863">and if we care about the Americans who are struggling to put food on the table, we should look very seriously at our immigration problem in the United States.</p><p end="1918" is_meta="true" speaker="Kris Kobach" start="1863">applause</p><p end="1978" is_meta="false" speaker="Tamar Jacoby" start="1918">You too can go into politics.</p><p end="1978" is_meta="false" speaker="Tamar Jacoby" start="1918">Thank you so much, and thank you so much to the sponsors of this event. So, like all of us, I&#8217;m a descendant of immigrants. In my case, there were two kinds of immigrants. On one side were the Eastern European Jews, and on the other side were the people who came on The Mayflower. So, I grew up in a house where I had two lessons. One was that difference was really kind of what made us great. It&#8217;s certainly what made the two sides of my family great. And I learned to understand later it was what made the country great. But I also learned that, in many ways, what we have in common -- this was another lesson in my household -- what we have in common is more important than our differences.</p><p end="2521" is_meta="false" speaker="Tom Tancredo" start="2462">Well, certainly, you could establish an immigration policy based upon the needs of the country in an economic sense. And that is a determination I think that we have mademany times during our past. Are our needs primarily low-skill, low-wage workers, or are they with high skilled. The people that Tamar and the mayor referred to as being these startup companies, these affluent -- or at least people who became affluent, had all these skills, great, fine.</p><p end="2577" is_meta="false" speaker="Tom Tancredo" start="2521">It's wonderful. But I'm telling you that that's not what our immigration policy is today.</p><p end="2577" is_meta="false" speaker="Tom Tancredo" start="2521">Today it is based almost entirely on something called family unification. And because we've had so many people coming into the country over such a long period of time from such low-skilled, low-wage backgrounds that that's who we get.</p><p end="2577" is_meta="false" speaker="Tom Tancredo" start="2521">Well, sure. It's, if you get here, once you get here and get status here, status as someone here legally, you can begin the process of bringing in your family, bringing in the immediate family then bringing in extended family.</p><p end="2577" is_meta="false" speaker="Tom Tancredo" start="2521">Being it's coming exactly from the same group of people, the same economic group,</p><p end="2577" is_meta="false" speaker="Tom Tancredo" start="2521">especially, that is predominantly low-skilled, low-wage workers when we have, right now, at least -- by the way, this is also legal -- I'm talking legal immigration.</p><p end="2577" is_meta="false" speaker="Tom Tancredo" start="2521">Let alone the people that are coming across the borders illegally. Not many of those people have these kinds of skills that you're talking about that are so desperately needed.</p><p end="2642" is_meta="false" speaker="Tom Tancredo" start="2577">It's interesting that you mention that because, of course, when we also start talking about the taxes that immigrants and even people who are here illegally pay, there is -- your side suggests that they're paying their fair share. But in reality, they pay nothing in terms of income taxes. Most of the people we're talking about end up getting income tax credit and therefore money back from the federal government because again, it's low-skilled,</p><p end="2642" is_meta="false" speaker="Tom Tancredo" start="2577">low-wage work.</p><p end="2700" is_meta="false" speaker="Tom Tancredo" start="2642">And low-skilled, low-wage people don't pay income taxes. They usually pay -- they pay sales taxes and that sort of thing. But it never balances off with --</p><p end="2700" is_meta="false" speaker="Tom Tancredo" start="2642">-- the costs we incur for the infrastructure we provide.</p><p end="2700" is_meta="false" speaker="Tom Tancredo" start="2642">They do.</p><p end="2700" is_meta="false" speaker="Tom Tancredo" start="2642">That is true. And economic impacts are not positive.</p><p end="2760" is_meta="false" speaker="Tom Tancredo" start="2700">Which, by the way, they'll never be able to claim.</p><p end="2760" is_meta="false" speaker="Kris Kobach" start="2700">But the fiscal impact is undisputed. Now, there are some economic studies that look at the overall impact. Have we cheapened the price of some goods? Have we given some economic benefits? But if you narrow it to the fiscal impact, it is undisputed. Every single study in the last 10 years, whether you're talking about Robert Rector's study in 2007 or the Census Bureau numbers that I related just a moment ago where you have seven, eight percent of illegal aliens consuming welfare programs, 51 percent of legal aliens and 39 percent of U.S. citizens, which, by the way, matches up well with that 40 percent figure. It shows statistically that they are consuming the fiscal benefits. And if you just look at in terms of the benefit to us as taxpayers, we're losing on --</p><p end="2760" is_meta="false" speaker="Tamar Jacoby" start="2700">I mean, again, it all just depends on how you measure it and how you look at it. If you look at it most immigrants pay their taxes to the federal level because they have their income tax withheld from their paycheck.</p><p end="2816" is_meta="false" speaker="Tamar Jacoby" start="2760">So if you look not just at the state level, but the federal level as well, and you look over their whole lifetimes, they actually pay in about as much as they take out because what costs is health and education --</p><p end="2816" is_meta="true" speaker="Tamar Jacoby" start="2760">talking simultaneously</p><p end="2816" is_meta="false" speaker="Tamar Jacoby" start="2760">Well, they're exaggerating their welfare numbers. But let me just make my --</p><p end="2816" is_meta="true" speaker="Tamar Jacoby" start="2760">talking simultaneously</p><p end="2816" is_meta="false" speaker="Tamar Jacoby" start="2760">Let me just make a closing point. The point is that what you're leaving out is growth, is the growth they make possible.</p><p end="2883" is_meta="false" speaker="Tamar Jacoby" start="2816">And let me just give you a couple numbers. So in the State of North Carolina, they measured over the '90s, what an immigrants -- what was the fiscal cost and what was the growth made possible in consumption and adding to businesses. Fiscal costs over 10 years, $61 million. Now, that's real money, that's those costs by Latinos coming to the States -- growth, growth, 11 billion --</p><p end="2883" is_meta="false" speaker="Tamar Jacoby" start="2816">Growth, 11 billion.</p><p end="2883" is_meta="false" speaker="Tom Tancredo" start="2816">That rightwing organization, the National Academy of Sciences, I mean, will you accept that as a legitimate entity that assesses these issues? I mean, it doesn't have -- to the best of my knowledge, it doesn't have a dog in this fight, it doesn't have a political bone to pick with anybody. It's the National Academy of Sciences. You can argue with the --</p><p end="2883" is_meta="false" speaker="Tom Tancredo" start="2816">It is also just common sense, it's not even something that you have to go through reams of statistical evidence to prove it is common sense.</p><p end="2945" is_meta="false" speaker="Tom Tancredo" start="2883">If you come here without an ability to provide a service that is well paid for you are not going to be able to pay the income taxes you're talking about, but you are undeniably going to require the services, the services for your children, the children who are in the public school system, the services for the -- the social services --</p><p end="2945" is_meta="false" speaker="Tamar Jacoby" start="2883">And I consider educating the workforce of the future --</p><p end="2945" is_meta="false" speaker="Tom Tancredo" start="2883">-- the social service benefits.</p><p end="2945" is_meta="false" speaker="Tamar Jacoby" start="2883">I consider educating the workforce for the future not as a welfare benefit but an investment.</p><p end="2945" is_meta="false" speaker="Tom Tancredo" start="2883">Yeah, or in the [spelled phonetically] day today [spelled phonetically].</p><p end="2945" is_meta="true" speaker="Tom Tancredo" start="2883">applause</p><p end="2945" is_meta="false" speaker="Tom Tancredo" start="2883">Sure, an investment. Well, okay, how about the investment in our prison system?</p><p end="3003" is_meta="false" speaker="Kris Kobach" start="2945">I [unintelligible] with that study, that Texas Comptroller study looked -- it didn't just look at fiscal income and outgo, then they went on and considered, "Well, have there been generations in second and third degree effects of extra businesses or extra --</p><p end="3003" is_meta="false" speaker="Tamar Jacoby" start="2945">Right.</p><p end="3003" is_meta="false" speaker="Kris Kobach" start="2945">-- consumption that might have occurred?" Now, that's fine, and look, let's get this straight, the fiscal debate is clear, they are a fiscal drag.

The winners are the employers who are able to exploit the illegal labor,</p><p end="3003" is_meta="false" speaker="Kris Kobach" start="2945">the losers are the consumer -- the winners are the consumers of some goods who really want that extra two pennies off the price of a head of lettuce, but the losers are the U.S.</p><p end="3003" is_meta="false" speaker="Kris Kobach" start="2945">citizens who lose their jobs, the U.S. citizens who are still working in those fields and are getting paid a lower wage, and the taxpayers.

Says that if you have a 10 percent increase in the number of laborers in a given industrial sector you will have in the short term a decrease in wages of seven to eight percent, and in the long term a decrease in wages of three to four percent, in the long term. So we agree on that, they can decide whether that's significant or not.</p><p end="3060" is_meta="false" speaker="Tamar Jacoby" start="3003">Three to four, three to four.</p><p end="3060" is_meta="false" speaker="Kris Kobach" start="3003">I think that&#8217;s significant.</p><p end="3060" is_meta="false" speaker="Tamar Jacoby" start="3003">For other high school dropouts.</p><p end="3060" is_meta="true" speaker="Tamar Jacoby" start="3003">applause</p><p end="3301" is_meta="false" speaker="Tom Tancredo" start="3237">Because the numbers today are so high of people coming from a particular area into a geographic area that bring the culture --</p><p end="3301" is_meta="false" speaker="Tom Tancredo" start="3237">That makes is much more difficult to assimilate.</p><p end="3301" is_meta="false" speaker="Tamar Jacoby" start="3237">People in the second generation, even among poor -- children of poor Mexicans,</p><p end="3301" is_meta="false" speaker="Tamar Jacoby" start="3237">everyone learns English. And the third generation, three-quarters of the people can&#8217;tspeak Spanish anymore, can&#8217;t speak to their grandmother. People are learning English as they did in the past.</p><p end="3301" is_meta="false" speaker="Tamar Jacoby" start="3237">Where I want to shift the conversation is, I believe that the policies of our opposing team would actually make integration or assimilation harder, not easier. They want to keep people on the wrong side of the law, not let them make restitution and get right with the law and come into society. They want to end birthright citizenship so that the children of immigrants grow up not as citizens, which every study that&#8217;s looked at it has shown makes the parents less likely to learn the language and integrate.</p><p end="3360" is_meta="false" speaker="Kris Kobach" start="3301">There are -- obviously, assimilation has occurred and obviously assimilation can occur in the future in America. But assimilation doesn&#8217;t happen automatically. As Tom mentioned, you have to have -- there&#8217;s a tipping point. If the percentage of the immigrant population is so high and is so disproportionately speaking one language or sharing one culture, then the pressure from the rest of us, the rest of the American society, on that group to assimilate is lower.</p><p end="3360" is_meta="false" speaker="Kris Kobach" start="3301">Well, actually, it&#8217;s to encourage people to leave and comply with the law and go home.</p><p end="3360" is_meta="false" speaker="Kris Kobach" start="3301">That&#8217;s the idea.</p><p end="3360" is_meta="true" speaker="Kris Kobach" start="3301">laughter</p><p end="3360" is_meta="false" speaker="Kris Kobach" start="3301">Now, but let me -- let me give one more point on assimilation, and that is one of the greatest engines of assimilation -- I think we can all agree on this -- is the public schools.</p><p end="3424" is_meta="false" speaker="Kris Kobach" start="3360">In the past for the last 100 years or so, the public schools have been the primary engine of assimilation. That engine is not working anymore. According to a study done at a highschool in San Diego, I think in 2002 or 2003, after three years of high school, the proportion of students self-identifying themselves as Americans went down 50 percent.</p><p end="3424" is_meta="false" speaker="Kris Kobach" start="3360">The proportion saying they were hyphenated Americans, in other words, Mexican-</p><p end="3424" is_meta="false" speaker="Kris Kobach" start="3360">American or something like that, went down 30 percent. And the number that they were saying they are a foreign nationality after three years of high school went up 52 percent.</p><p end="3424" is_meta="false" speaker="Tamar Jacoby" start="3360">And that study was done in the middle of the battle over Prop 187, which was denying benefits to immigrants --</p><p end="3424" is_meta="true" speaker="Tamar Jacoby" start="3360">talking simultaneously</p><p end="3424" is_meta="false" speaker="Kris Kobach" start="3360">That was in 1994.</p><p end="3424" is_meta="false" speaker="Tamar Jacoby" start="3360">-- had commercials on TV saying stop them coming -- I know the study you&#8217;re talking about, Rumbaugh&#8217;s [phonetic] study, and what he was showing was that when there&#8217;s an anti-immigrant climate, people get alienated and identify with their group. And that&#8217;s exactly what I would argue your side is creating, is an anti-immigrant climate that drives people to identify with their group and not assimilate.</p><p end="3477" is_meta="false" speaker="Tom Tancredo" start="3424">Sure, the logical argument is this: If people come into this country illegally, especially illegally, we should all go, huh, well, you're an immigrant, and therefore we should be happy about the fact you're here. We should not -- we should not raise our concerns about it. We should not say that people should come into the country the legal way.</p><p end="3477" is_meta="false" speaker="Tom Tancredo" start="3424">There is a door. 180 -- 165,000 people a month come in today still legally. We are the most liberal country in the world regarding to legal immigration. But the minute we start talking about the fact that people are violating American laws to get here, that's all of a sudden making it an uncomfortable place for immigrants. Well, bologna. I will not accept the idea that you can't talk the rule of law and be critical of people coming into this country illegally.</p><p end="3477" is_meta="false" speaker="Tamar Jacoby" start="3424">I agree with you that illegal immigration -- I agree with you --</p><p end="3477" is_meta="false" speaker="Tamar Jacoby" start="3424">Tom Tancredo:What's wrong with that?</p><p end="3477" is_meta="false" speaker="Tamar Jacoby" start="3424">-- that illegal immigration is not what the country wants.</p><p end="3538" is_meta="false" speaker="Tamar Jacoby" start="3477">And I agree with you --</p><p end="3538" is_meta="false" speaker="Tom Tancredo" start="3477">But you want to grant an amnesty.</p><p end="3538" is_meta="false" speaker="Tamar Jacoby" start="3477">that we need enforcement of the rule of law. But the problem is our system makes it hard to enter legally, and we don't have enough places for the workers we need. And then we make it easy to enter illegally.</p><p end="3538" is_meta="false" speaker="Tom Tancredo" start="3477">A million -- a little over a million and a quarter people coming legally every year. And by the way, as you know, Tamar, the number of visas that are allowable for people to come here and work in the agricultural arena, H-2A, I believe, are unlimited. Right there you could have 10 million people come tomorrow and on their visas.</p><p end="3538" is_meta="false" speaker="Tamar Jacoby" start="3477">But they don't.</p><p end="3538" is_meta="false" speaker="Tom Tancredo" start="3477">You don't because --</p><p end="3538" is_meta="true" speaker="Tom Tancredo" start="3477">talking simultaneously</p><p end="3538" is_meta="false" speaker="Tom Tancredo" start="3477">Just a moment.</p><p end="3538" is_meta="false" speaker="Tom Tancredo" start="3477">You don't have that because --</p><p end="3538" is_meta="false" speaker="Tom Tancredo" start="3477">All right. Okay.</p><p end="3660" is_meta="false" speaker="Kris Kobach" start="3599">Here legally.</p><p end="3660" is_meta="false" speaker="Kris Kobach" start="3599">Here legally and are U.S. citizens --</p><p end="3660" is_meta="false" speaker="Kris Kobach" start="3599">-- primarily. But let me correct a number Juli&#225;n mentioned.</p><p end="3660" is_meta="false" speaker="Kris Kobach" start="3599">The census bureau, the actual number, you&#8217;re right, 308 million total people residing in America, approximately 36 million are aliens, and that includes legal and illegal.</p><p end="3720" is_meta="false" speaker="Kris Kobach" start="3660">So it's about 12 percent --</p><p end="3720" is_meta="false" speaker="Kris Kobach" start="3660">-- of the population. And that is basically --</p><p end="3720" is_meta="true" speaker="Kris Kobach" start="3660">talking simultaneously</p><p end="3720" is_meta="false" speaker="Kris Kobach" start="3660">11. --</p><p end="3720" is_meta="false" speaker="Kris Kobach" start="3660">-- million is illegal. You do the math.</p><p end="3720" is_meta="false" speaker="Tamar Jacoby" start="3660">That is a good question. Are you guys against just illegal immigration, or are you against immigration, period?</p><p end="3720" is_meta="false" speaker="Kris Kobach" start="3660">I'm telling you what we are in favor of is increasing the percentage of aliens who are exactly the ones you're talking about, the job creators, the entrepreneurs that are starting the companies. The way you increase that percentage is you reduce illegal immigration to zero, and you change our priorities about legal immigration, and you give higher preference to people who are skilled.</p><p end="3720" is_meta="false" speaker="Tamar Jacoby" start="3660">And who --</p><p end="3720" is_meta="false" speaker="Kris Kobach" start="3660">We can accept the cream of the crop, and we should.</p><p end="3720" is_meta="false" speaker="Tamar Jacoby" start="3660">And who's going to grow our food? And who's going to take care of our old people?</p><p end="3720" is_meta="false" speaker="Tamar Jacoby" start="3660">And who's going to work in hospitals?</p><p end="3720" is_meta="false" speaker="Kris Kobach" start="3660">Well, the 14 million unemployed Americans would be a starter.</p><p end="3779" is_meta="false" speaker="Tom Tancredo" start="3720">Mayor of Detroit has already responded to that, I think.</p><p end="3834" is_meta="false" speaker="Kris Kobach" start="3779">Yeah, Mayor Bloomberg, you notice he didn't suggest that the illegal aliens come to any particular borough of New York. And the citizens of Detroit weren't asked whether --</p><p end="3834" is_meta="false" speaker="Kris Kobach" start="3779">you know, they're facing unemployment -- whether they would like a large number of unskilled folks to come in and help revive their economy by taking a job they're already -</p><p end="3834" is_meta="false" speaker="Kris Kobach" start="3779">-</p><p end="3834" is_meta="false" speaker="Tamar Jacoby" start="3779">You can make light of this, but I mean, it's true. Go to any immigrant neighborhood, they revitalize the neighborhoods. They open shops. They open restaurants. They've taken burnt out neighborhoods across the country and revitalized them on the same way they create small businesses, and they're -- and they're consumers. Yes, I don't know if we really want to send them all to Detroit. But the truth is immigrants bring economic vitality, and they create jobs.</p><p end="3900" is_meta="false" speaker="Tom Tancredo" start="3834">Yeah. What our opponents have done here is very skillful, really great at it, and I give them credit for setting up all kinds of straw man arguments, you know, that if you are opposed to immigration, you don't understand that some people who are coming here are patriots and want to be -- well, of course, it's absolutely true. Nobody's suggesting that every single immigrant comes here under that premise. But the idea that you -- when you say you can't deport, I don't have any -- I have never once, in as many millions of words as I have expended on this topic, suggested everybody's got to be deported. All I've ever said is, look, all you have to do is obey the law.</p><p end="3959" is_meta="false" speaker="Tom Tancredo" start="3900">All you have to do is restrict the ability of a employer to give a job to somebody who is here illegally. People self-deport when that happens. It happened in Arizona. You do not have to round people up. These are all cannards. These are all things that people on the other say to make it look as though we're all people who are just waiting and biding our time until we can get these people out of our country. That's --</p><p end="3959" is_meta="false" speaker="Tamar Jacoby" start="3900">Your policy is even worse than deportation.</p><p end="3959" is_meta="false" speaker="Tom Tancredo" start="3900">Why is it hard to suggest that obeying the law would be a good way to deal with --</p><p end="4018" is_meta="false" speaker="Tamar Jacoby" start="3959">And now we're saying, let's make their lives so miserable that --</p><p end="4018" is_meta="false" speaker="Tamar Jacoby" start="3959">-- it will drive them home. I don't think that's the way to deal with that.</p><p end="4018" is_meta="false" speaker="Kris Kobach" start="3959">Statistically -- statistically, attrition through enforcement works. And it's basically the idea. It's the same law enforcement approach you have. You have a section of highway 95 where there are no police officers patrolling. You don't say, well, the only options are to have an amnesty, i.e., have no speed limit, or to catch 100 percent of the speeders. No.</p><p end="4018" is_meta="false" speaker="Kris Kobach" start="3959">Which would mean to --</p><p end="4018" is_meta="false" speaker="Kris Kobach" start="3959">Okay.</p><p end="4018" is_meta="false" speaker="Kris Kobach" start="3959">Yeah. We have the numbers. Arizona, more than any other state, has tried to encourage people to leave. Give disincentives. Take away public benefits. From middle of 2008 tomiddle of 2009, the overall illegal alien population in the United States dropped seven percent.</p><p end="4018" is_meta="false" speaker="Tamar Jacoby" start="3959">Arizona --</p><p end="4018" is_meta="false" speaker="Kris Kobach" start="3959">In Arizona, in dropped 18 percent, more than double the national average.</p><p end="4018" is_meta="true" speaker="Kris Kobach" start="3959">talking simultaneously</p><p end="4018" is_meta="false" speaker="Tamar Jacoby" start="3959">But most of them didn't go home.</p><p end="4018" is_meta="false" speaker="Kris Kobach" start="3959">The only difference was the enforcement.</p><p end="4018" is_meta="false" speaker="Tamar Jacoby" start="3959">But most of them didn't go home.</p><p end="4080" is_meta="false" speaker="Tamar Jacoby" start="4018">They went to other neighboring states right next to --</p><p end="4080" is_meta="false" speaker="Kris Kobach" start="4018">Then why did the Mexican -- why did the Mexicans &#8211; why did the Mexican state of Sonora&#8230;</p><p end="4080" is_meta="true" speaker="Kris Kobach" start="4018">talking simultaneously</p><p end="4080" is_meta="false" speaker="Tamar Jacoby" start="4018">That's true, but it does make the point that they [unintelligible].</p><p end="4080" is_meta="true" speaker="Tamar Jacoby" start="4018">talking simultaneously</p><p end="4080" is_meta="false" speaker="Kris Kobach" start="4018">Why did president --</p><p end="4140" is_meta="false" speaker="Kris Kobach" start="4080">[inaudible] I'd like to answer one her points, though. The designation, by the way, is by the Southern Poverty Law Center which designates lots of people lots of things, but the bit about no human being being illegal, the reason I use the term "illegal alien" or "alien unlawfully present in the United States," is those are the terms used by federal law, and being a lawyer, I try to use the terms used by law.</p><p end="4140" is_meta="true" speaker="Kris Kobach" start="4080">laughter</p><p end="4140" is_meta="false" speaker="Kris Kobach" start="4080">The word "undocumented immigrant" does not appear anywhere in the entire United States Code.</p><p end="4140" is_meta="false" speaker="Kris Kobach" start="4080">[unintelligible] the term "undocumented worker" does not appear.</p><p end="4198" is_meta="false" speaker="Kris Kobach" start="4140">I understand that perfectly well.

And so they&#8217;re based on very large surveys done by the Census Bureau. And those numbers,</p><p end="4322" is_meta="false" speaker="Kris Kobach" start="4263">the 11.3 million, those are generally agreed upon numbers by both the Pew Center and by the Center for Immigration Studies so I think there&#8217;s broad agreement --</p><p end="4322" is_meta="false" speaker="Tamar Jacoby" start="4263">No, I'm just going to say the same thing.</p><p end="4322" is_meta="false" speaker="Tamar Jacoby" start="4263">Something technical, we agree on something technical.</p><p end="4386" is_meta="false" speaker="Tom Tancredo" start="4322">I think I at least attempted to address that when I spoke earlier when I talked about these periods of timeout. In fact, we have had immigrants -- immigration is an important part of America. There is nothing -- there is no argument about that. It&#8217;s just that it was rational over American history to create an immigration policy that fit the time, that fit the economic situation in the country. That&#8217;s exactly what happened in the 1890s and the 1900s, massive immigration, low-skilled people. Fine, worked, it&#8217;s okay. And so you can say over a long period of time, it worked. Well, it would work again today except that we have never had this timeout. And we continue to bring in the same category,</p><p end="4386" is_meta="false" speaker="Tom Tancredo" start="4322">low-skilled, low-wage worker, even though we don&#8217;t have enough jobs.</p><p end="4502" is_meta="false" speaker="Tom Tancredo" start="4443">I mean, it makes no sense.</p><p end="4502" is_meta="false" speaker="Tamar Jacoby" start="4443">The problem with your arguments -- with our opponents&#8217; arguments about integration and assimilation is they&#8217;re all based on hypotheticals. There&#8217;s no timeout. There was a timeout in the past. There&#8217;s too much welfare, that we didn&#8217;t have so much welfare in the past. But you&#8217;re not looking at the empirical evidence of whether today&#8217;s immigrants are integrating, and they are. 99.9 percent of the children are learning English. Even in the first generation, the home ownership rates and the wealth accumulation rise to Americans of similar background. They&#8217;re owning homes. They&#8217;re starting businesses.</p><p end="4502" is_meta="false" speaker="Tamar Jacoby" start="4443">They fighting our wars, and they&#8217;re integrating.</p><p end="4502" is_meta="false" speaker="Tom Tancredo" start="4443">Almost every single study on this -- this is one of the -- another area where there is some degree of agreement in the number of studies out there.</p><p end="4570" is_meta="false" speaker="Tom Tancredo" start="4502">Hispanic immigrants in America -- although Hispanics make economic and educational gains from the first to the second generation, not disputed, the progress stops there.</p><p end="4570" is_meta="false" speaker="Tom Tancredo" start="4502">Third-generation Hispanics still earn significantly less than whites, graduate from collegeat less than 50 percent of whites, and, by the way, in terms of language, still do not accept English as the primary language, even at the third generation.</p><p end="4570" is_meta="false" speaker="Tamar Jacoby" start="4502">That&#8217;s just not true.</p><p end="4570" is_meta="false" speaker="Tom Tancredo" start="4502">Well, that&#8217;s -- okay. So we have another argument about statistics.</p><p end="4570" is_meta="false" speaker="Tom Tancredo" start="4502">John Donvan: We have an impasse on that. There&#8217;s a -- ma&#8217;am in the third row. Yeah,</p><p end="4570" is_meta="false" speaker="Tom Tancredo" start="4502">there&#8217;s a -- if you look to your left, that mic&#8217;s closer. And if you could stand, thanks.</p><p end="4621" is_meta="false" speaker="Tamar Jacoby" start="4570">Well, but there is actually something to say about this. Can I just -- can I say something to that? It&#8217;s not about -- I&#8217;m not going to talk about -- I&#8217;m going to talk about immigration, I promise you, I promise you.</p><p end="4621" is_meta="false" speaker="Tamar Jacoby" start="4570">John Donvan:Save it for your closing remarks.</p><p end="4621" is_meta="false" speaker="Tamar Jacoby" start="4570">And for many industries, the choice is actually do we send the jobs abroad or do we have the immigrants come here? For, in agriculture, if immigrants don&#8217;t come here, I guarantee you, Americans are not going to go out into the fields and pick lettuce and pick fruit. We will start outsourcing --</p><p end="4621" is_meta="false" speaker="Kris Kobach" start="4570">The majority of employees in those fields are Americans right now.</p><p end="4621" is_meta="false" speaker="Tamar Jacoby" start="4570">We will start outsourcing agriculture.</p><p end="4621" is_meta="false" speaker="Kris Kobach" start="4570">According to the census, the majority -- 56 percent are Americans in those fields right now.</p><p end="4678" is_meta="false" speaker="Tamar Jacoby" start="4621">But they&#8217;re supervisors, not the workers.</p><p end="4678" is_meta="false" speaker="Kris Kobach" start="4621">Well, see, you heard the numbers, although they're somewhat disputed about the fiscal drag. I think everybody's coming to an agreement, Democratic or Republican alike that we have to get a hold of this deficit, $1.4 trillion a year.</p><p end="4678" is_meta="false" speaker="Kris Kobach" start="4621">Well, if we don't create -- if we do not create, in this country, 200,000 jobs a month, that's 200,000 new jobs every month have to be created in this country by the private sector in order for us to climb out of this recession, okay? Most economists agree that that's the number. We haven't had a 200,000 monthly increase in quite some time.</p><p end="4738" is_meta="false" speaker="Kris Kobach" start="4678">But we do bring in 160 some thousand a month legally, let alone the numbers that come across the border and fly in this country and stay, which is a significant number. It's not just people coming across the border who are illegal aliens in the country. And so they're part of the problem. Where do those jobs go?</p><p end="4797" is_meta="false" speaker="Tamar Jacoby" start="4738">So the key and the most important change --</p><p end="4797" is_meta="false" speaker="Tamar Jacoby" start="4738">-- is that we give the workers who we're going to need in the future a way to come legally. Right now, we don't need that many foreign workers. We need some in agriculture. And at the high end, we don't need that many. But in the future when the economy picks up, and Americans go back to their better jobs and their year-round jobs,</p><p end="4797" is_meta="false" speaker="Tamar Jacoby" start="4738">and they start to go to restaurants, and they start to go to hotels, and we start to build houses again, we're going to need immigrant workers. And on that day, I say we want to have them come legally as opposed to illegally. If our economy needs them, have them come legally. I also think we need enforcement. Our opponents aren't wrong about enforcement. We do need better enforcement on the border and better enforcement in the workplace to make sure -- we need to create legal channels and enforce against the people who are coming illegally.</p><p end="4860" is_meta="false" speaker="Tamar Jacoby" start="4797">And we need some answer for the 11 million people who are already here and are not going home no matter how miserable we make them with police stops and other things.</p><p end="4860" is_meta="false" speaker="Tamar Jacoby" start="4797">You know, maybe some of them will go home --</p><p end="4860" is_meta="false" speaker="Tamar Jacoby" start="4797">No, no. You need -- the best answer for illegal immigration is a legal immigration system that works. If people are coming to work here, give them a legal way to come and then stop the illegals coming --</p><p end="4924" is_meta="false" speaker="Kris Kobach" start="4860">Amnesty is a horrible idea for four quick -- for four reasons. Number one, you're going to see that the fiscal impact is going to triple. The 89.3 -- $89.1 billion a year that we're losing fiscally is going to become 2.6 trillion over 10 years. That was according to the Robert Rector study in 2007. The reason is simple. Right now, illegal aliens get food stamps, Medicaid, free school lunches, K through 12 education. If they become legalized, then they get the big ones. Then they get Medicare and Social Security. Andthe price goes way, way up. Talk about the golden door. Number two, it won't just be 11.3 million. The last time we had a major amnesty in 1986, according to the INS's own records, 398,000 illegal aliens quickly came across the border to falsely claim that they were already here and grabbed the amnesty.</p><p end="4980" is_meta="false" speaker="Kris Kobach" start="4924">Number three, we've been hearing about the terrorists. We mentioned that earlier about the terrorists coming in. The notion that we are going to suddenly sift through this population and know who the terrorists are and who they aren't is demonstrably false.</p><p end="4980" is_meta="false" speaker="Kris Kobach" start="4924">Mahmud Abouhalima who was one of the ring leaders in the &#8217;93 attack on the World Trade Center here in this city was given amnesty in the 1986 amnesty. And number four,</p><p end="4980" is_meta="false" speaker="Kris Kobach" start="4924">it's a slap in the face to the people --</p><p end="4980" is_meta="false" speaker="Kris Kobach" start="4924">-- who did it the right way.</p><p end="4980" is_meta="false" speaker="Tamar Jacoby" start="4924">No one's talking about amnesty. We're talking about asking people to make restitution and get right with the law. Nobody's talking about amnesty.</p><p end="4980" is_meta="false" speaker="Kris Kobach" start="4924">A slap on the wrist, and then you get to stay. That's called amnesty.</p><p end="5106" is_meta="false" speaker="Kris Kobach" start="5040">As a lawyer who has worked in this area, you're right. It's about 30,000 who are detained. Those are people in deportation proceedings. We call them removal proceedings. But that's a small percentage of the total number of people who are being removed from the country at any given time. And the reason that 30,000 is actually too low is that if you do not detain an alien while he is in removal proceedings, and then the judge says, at the end of the immigration removal hearing, "You are deported," hands him a removal letter, 93 percent will abscond. They will leave. They will disobey the letter. And it's known among the immigration attorneys as a run letter. And so if you don't detain, they don't go. And if we believe that our courts have any meaning, and are nothing more than just a laughing stock, we have got to try to detain the ones that present the highest risk of leaving --</p><p end="5106" is_meta="false" speaker="Tamar Jacoby" start="5040">But the point is the whole system is broken.</p><p end="5160" is_meta="false" speaker="Tamar Jacoby" start="5106">So the point is that the market --</p><p end="5160" is_meta="false" speaker="Tamar Jacoby" start="5106">-- works really well to attract people -- when times are good, the market attracts people.</p><p end="5227" is_meta="false" speaker="Tamar Jacoby" start="5160">And when times are bad, people get the signal all the way to their villages in Mexico, and they don't come. Since the downturn, half as many people have been coming every year from Mexico, half. People hear that there are no jobs, and so they don't come. They're not coming for welfare. They're not coming for unemployment. They don't get those things. They're coming to work. And that's -- we should be happy about that.</p><p end="5227" is_meta="false" speaker="Tamar Jacoby" start="5160">-- I think we should have is a way for when the market is good and attracting people,</p><p end="5227" is_meta="false" speaker="Tamar Jacoby" start="5160">those people who are coming to work should be able to come legally. I don't think we need people working here and being --</p><p end="5227" is_meta="false" speaker="Tom Tancredo" start="5160">Tamar apparently agrees that jobs are the attraction. Without the jobs, they don't come.</p><p end="5227" is_meta="false" speaker="Tom Tancredo" start="5160">Without the jobs, they go back. Therefore, it's an enforcement issue. Something that's called -- right now, it's a program that's voluntary. It should be mandatory. It's called E-</p><p end="5227" is_meta="false" speaker="Tom Tancredo" start="5160">Verify, just a requirement that every employer use a process that --</p><p end="5227" is_meta="false" speaker="Tamar Jacoby" start="5160">I'm for E-Verify.</p><p end="5227" is_meta="false" speaker="Tom Tancredo" start="5160">-- actually verifies whether the person is -- has got a good social security number.</p><p end="5279" is_meta="false" speaker="Tom Tancredo" start="5227">Now, can it be -- can there be problems? Of course. You can steal the social security.</p><p end="5279" is_meta="false" speaker="Tom Tancredo" start="5227">But it's a great use of a tool that's out there that would not cost a great deal of money, it's an easy process, and it would have the effect if Tamara's right that people won't come if they hear there's no jobs, it would have the effect I think also of saying I believe if there are no jobs --</p><p end="5279" is_meta="false" speaker="Tom Tancredo" start="5227">-- so many [spelled phonetically] people left, by the way --</p><p end="5279" is_meta="false" speaker="Tom Tancredo" start="5227">-- so many people left in Arizona --</p><p end="5279" is_meta="false" speaker="Tom Tancredo" start="5227">Juli&#225;n Castro:Let me just say that I agree that jobs are what drive folks over here. I disagree with the idea that if those jobs aren't there at a given time that they're necessarily just going to go back. You know, the point was made very early that these folks -- let's say that you've had a job for 12 years, 13 years, and you've had -- and you're married now and you have children who are United States citizens, you know, for the children the United States is home.</p><p end="5335" is_meta="false" speaker="Tom Tancredo" start="5279">Mexico or wherever they're from is not home. And in many ways, Mexico isn't even the place that feels like home anymore. So it's a much more complicated issue than just to say if you press this button then this is going to happen.</p><p end="5335" is_meta="false" speaker="Tom Tancredo" start="5279">That's not reality. That's not [unintelligible].</p><p end="5335" is_meta="false" speaker="Tamar Jacoby" start="5279">So I work with seasonal employers. I just did a survey of a couple hundred of -- actually probably up to 500 seasonal employers. These are like resorts in remote places and fruit picking and seasonal work. And I asked them, are more Americans showing up now in the downturn to apply for these jobs?</p><p end="5403" is_meta="false" speaker="Tamar Jacoby" start="5335">And what they tell me is in the past, no, Americans showed up to work in a seasonal job but, yes, this year a little uptick in the numbers of Americans showing up, but then when they learn that it's only a seasonal job and that it's physically -- that it's outside and that it's not going to lead to anything, that they're going to have to leave at the end, people are not taking those jobs, staying for maybe a few weeks and then leaving. The Americans are not competing with immigrants. They're mostly doing jobs that Americans do not --</p><p end="5403" is_meta="false" speaker="Tamar Jacoby" start="5335">are not wanting to do.</p><p end="5403" is_meta="false" speaker="Kris Kobach" start="5335">They --</p><p end="5463" is_meta="false" speaker="Tamar Jacoby" start="5403">But you're leaving out the turnover also went up.</p><p end="5463" is_meta="false" speaker="Kris Kobach" start="5403">That&#8217;s exactly what has to happen.</p><p end="5463" is_meta="false" speaker="Tamar Jacoby" start="5403">The turnover went through the roof because people do the jobs for a little while and then they don&#8217;t want to do them anymore.</p><p end="5463" is_meta="false" speaker="Kris Kobach" start="5403">Twenty years ago, the average wage in meatpacking was about $12 an hour.</p><p end="5463" is_meta="false" speaker="Tamar Jacoby" start="5403">And that's --</p><p end="5463" is_meta="false" speaker="Kris Kobach" start="5403">Now it&#8217;s about eight dollars an hour, that&#8217;s not in real dollars that&#8217;s in absolute dollars.</p><p end="5463" is_meta="false" speaker="Kris Kobach" start="5403">There&#8217;s no other industry --</p><p end="5463" is_meta="true" speaker="Tamar Jacoby" start="5403">unintelligible</p><p end="5463" is_meta="false" speaker="Tamar Jacoby" start="5403">Oh, no.[applause]</p><p end="5646" is_meta="false" speaker="Tom Tancredo" start="5579">I mentioned that I first got into this whole thing because of the intellectual stimulation I believe that it provides. And I think tonight&#8217;s a good example, that it certainly does that.</p><p end="5646" is_meta="false" speaker="Tom Tancredo" start="5579">It is a fascinating discussion, and I sincerely respect the opinions of the people on the other side of this. I would say that there is, for America, I think all of us at this table want exactly what has been expressed, Juli&#225;n, by you, certainly an opportunity for people who come here, an opportunity to do great things.</p><p end="5698" is_meta="false" speaker="Tom Tancredo" start="5646">I also want for people who live here, for people who are on the lowest rung of the economic ladder in this country to also have an opportunity, to have the ability to actually get a job, progress through the system, and especially the ones -- I&#8217;m talking about the ones that have done it the right way. Nothing hurts -- there&#8217;s no group of people in the United States that&#8217;s more negatively impacted by massive immigration, both legal and illegal, of low-skilled, low-wage people, than the people who are here legally, who are low-skilled, low-wage people. They are our citizens. Why is it so hard for us to think about them, to think about their needs? For the most part, you know, when we&#8217;re talking about the immigration process and these people, they came the right way. And, by the way, this has nothing to do with race, ethnicity, absolutely nothing.</p><p end="5761" is_meta="false" speaker="Tom Tancredo" start="5698">I assure you that if Italy was on our southern border, had as much poverty, as much population, we would have just as many problems with Italians coming across that border illegally. It&#8217;s got nothing to do with ethnicity, nothing. Although it&#8217;s always tried to be -</p><p end="5761" is_meta="false" speaker="Tom Tancredo" start="5698">- people try to cast it in that light because they want to move the discussion away from the real problem and to this bogeyman of racism. Is it out there? Of course. But I&#8217;ll tell you what, it does not motivate me. All I want is for this country to achieve its goals. I want it to be the place, yeah, that, still, everybody wants to come because we have a vibrant economy in which most of the people here are doing well, in fact, all of the people are doing well, and this is --</p><p end="5761" is_meta="false" speaker="Tom Tancredo" start="5698">John Donvan:Tom Tancredo, your time&#8217;s up. Thank you.</p><p end="5761" is_meta="false" speaker="Tom Tancredo" start="5698">Okay.</p><p end="5761" is_meta="true" speaker="Tom Tancredo" start="5698">applause</p><p end="5761" is_meta="false" speaker="Tamar Jacoby" start="5698">Well, in conclusion, I would just like to sharpen the choice here a little bit.</p><p end="5821" is_meta="false" speaker="Tamar Jacoby" start="5761">I think what you&#8217;ve heard is we all agree that the immigration system we have isn&#8217;t working, but we differ in a very sharp way about what the solution is. Our opponents say that the solution has one dimension. It&#8217;s enforcement and enforcement only. We say that the solution has several dimensions. Yes, it&#8217;s enforcement. Yes, it&#8217;s security. But it&#8217;s also a legal immigration system that works. The best antidote to illegal immigration is a legal immigration system that works. And I urge -- and the other place we disagree is we disagree over whether immigration and, really, the economy in America and American life is a zero-sum game or not. Our opponents are saying they have the vision of America that leaves no room for people with energy and grit and entrepreneurialism who want to come here and make better lives for their families, but also make America a better place.</p><p end="5821" is_meta="false" speaker="Tamar Jacoby" start="5761">They have no room for -- their vision leaves no room for hope and for an expansive America.</p><p end="5883" is_meta="false" speaker="Tamar Jacoby" start="5821">Their vision is that there&#8217;s never enough of anything and that&#8217;s it&#8217;s a zero-sum game.</p><p end="5883" is_meta="false" speaker="Tamar Jacoby" start="5821">And our point is that that&#8217;s just not true in America. Yes, we&#8217;re in a hard time now, but that hard time is not going to last forever. Immigrants don't take jobs. They create them.</p><p end="5883" is_meta="false" speaker="Tamar Jacoby" start="5821">Immigrants don't threaten us. They bring talent and vitality. American culture and society haven't lost their appeal. Immigrants are as drawn to them as ever, and immigrants are still integrating or assimilating every bit as fast as they did in the past. So I think the notion is exactly wrong. Shutting the gates now would be a disastrous policy.</p><p end="5883" is_meta="false" speaker="Tamar Jacoby" start="5821">We need immigrants to create jobs and grow. And that need's only going to get stronger as the economy recovers. Just saying no isn't an answer. It's a fantasy, and it's an un-</p><p end="5883" is_meta="false" speaker="Tamar Jacoby" start="5821">American fantasy at that.</p><p end="5883" is_meta="true" speaker="Tamar Jacoby" start="5821">applause</p><p end="5883" is_meta="false" speaker="Tamar Jacoby" start="5821">John Donvan:Thank you, Tamar Jacoby. Our motion is &#8220;Don't give us your tired, your poor, your huddled masses.&#8221; And here to argue for the motion, Kris Kobach, Secretary of State of Kansas and co-author of Arizona's S.B. 1070, the legal immigration law.</p><p end="5944" is_meta="false" speaker="Kris Kobach" start="5883">I just want to address a couple of loose ends quickly. Juli&#225;n just mentioned this notion that if we had an amnesty, it would be just fine. It'd be fair because the illegal aliens would go to the end of the line. Legally speaking, that's impossible. When you have an amnesty, you immediately give lawful status to the people who are here. They have been automatically given what four to five million people are waiting for who are trying to do it the right way. There is no such thing as the end of the line. As soon as you grant an amnesty, the person is automatically at the front of the line. And then we heard from them earlier that we shouldn't have a policy that fluctuates, encourages immigration some years, it discourages it depending on the needs of the U.S. economy. It should be pretty much wide open all the time. No. That's exactly what we want. We want immigration policy that is legal and that meets the interests of the United States because we owe our highest duty to our own citizens. And finally, we hear about this point again and again,</p><p end="5944" is_meta="false" speaker="Kris Kobach" start="5883">and they're encouraging this myth of belief that there are jobs Americans won't do. And we have to bring them in for the lower end jobs because Americans won't do those jobs.</p><p end="6001" is_meta="false" speaker="Kris Kobach" start="5944">Now, remember, I told you the statistics. Americans are doing those jobs. But there's a cultural problem with that argument too. It's encouraging high school kids today, many of whom have never pulled on the starter cord of a Briggs and Stratton lawnmower engine, to believe that certain jobs are beneath them. I would say that is un-American.</p><p end="6001" is_meta="false" speaker="Kris Kobach" start="5944">Our country is built on manual labor, everybody going through a period in their life when they worked a job like that, and then they moved on. Well, this attitude of, let the immigrants do those jobs is a pernicious attitude in our society. And so I'll conclude --</p><p end="6001" is_meta="true" speaker="Kris Kobach" start="5944">applause</p><p end="6001" is_meta="false" speaker="Kris Kobach" start="5944">-- conclude with this. Don't give us your tired and your poor because our tired and our poor American citizens, who are disproportionately minority and who are out of work need those jobs. They need also the welfare state to survive. And those things are not going to happen if you have a massive amnesty or you have unbridled illegal immigration continuing, which an amnesty would further.</p></transcript></debate>
