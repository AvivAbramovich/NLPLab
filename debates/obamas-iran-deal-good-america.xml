You are a senior fellow at the Hudson Institute, a former deputy assistant secretary of defense, a former senior director in the National Security Council, also an insider in this process . You helped devise and coordinate a lot of U.S. strategies on Middle East issues, including efforts to contain Iran . You recently Tweeted this, &#8220; In --&#8221; 1 44 characters -- &#8220; In Obama -land, the kiss of the nuclear deal will turn the Iranian frog into a beautiful prince, &#8221; but don &#8217;t you have to kiss a lot of frogs before you find a prince?</p><p end="599" is_meta="false" speaker="Michael Doran" start="541">They &#8217;re kissing a lot of frogs . It&#8217;s true.</p><p end="599" is_meta="true" speaker="Michael Doran" start="541">laughter</p><p end="599" is_meta="false" speaker="Michael Doran" start="541">Yes.</p><p end="599" is_meta="false" speaker="Michael Doran" start="541">I &#8217;m against that, yes.</p><p end="659" is_meta="false" speaker="Mark Dubowitz" start="599">That is true . That is true . We keep sending them ideas, and the White House keeps saying, you know, &#8220; Iran sanctions are just so yesterday. &#8221;</p><p end="659" is_meta="true" speaker="Mark Dubowitz" start="599">laughter</p><p end="782" is_meta="false" speaker="Philip Gordon" start="718">All right . Thanks very much, everybody . Thanks for coming . I&#8217;m really pleased to be here and honored to be joined on my side of the debate by Tom Pickering . Also glad to be up here with Mark and Mike . They play an important role . We disagree on this subject, but they play an important role in what is a really important debate . Let me get straight to the po int. Tom and I are going to argue that the Iran deal of President Obama is good for America for three basic reasons .</p><p end="840" is_meta="false" speaker="Philip Gordon" start="782">One, it &#8217;s important for the United States to stop Iran from acquiring a nuclear weapon.</p><p end="840" is_meta="false" speaker="Philip Gordon" start="782">Two, this deal effectively does that, and it does it while avoiding a costly and unpredictable conflict . And three, the alternatives to this deal -- the alternatives to this deal are far worse . And I &#8217;m going to ask you to pay particular attention to this third point, because I suspect our opponents in this debate will spend a considerable amount of time telling you why this agreement is imperfect and why it should also have X, Y, and Z .</p><p end="840" is_meta="false" speaker="Philip Gordon" start="782">What I don&#8217;t think you &#8217;ll hear them do is present a credible and realistic alternative to it .</p><p end="840" is_meta="false" speaker="Philip Gordon" start="782">And I r emind you as we start, that the proposition on the table is not, &#8220; Is this a perfectdeal that you would write alone if you didn&#8217; t have to negotiate it with somebody else?&#8221;</p><p end="840" is_meta="false" speaker="Philip Gordon" start="782">but &#8220;Is it good for America? &#8221; And I think if that&#8217;s the question, it clearly is . In fact, I don &#8217;t even think it&#8217;s much of a close call.</p><p end="901" is_meta="false" speaker="Philip Gordon" start="840">The first point , I&#8217;ll be very brief on . The United States has an interest in stopping Iran from getting a nuclear weapon because an Iran with a nuclear weapon could threaten the regi on and some of our close allies, including Israel. It could be a precedent and a stimulant for other countries in the region to develop nuclear weapons . And it would be harder to deter and contain it in terms of its foreign policy in the region. I just want that to be clear. I don &#8217;t think our opponents disagree with that, so I would just want to stipulate it upfront. That doesn&#8217;t require a debate . It is important for the United States .</p><p end="901" is_meta="false" speaker="Philip Gordon" start="840">What we disagree on is whether this deal effectively does that. And Tom and I will assert that it does, and let me tell you why and why it&#8217;s good for America. The framework agreement that the Obama Administration negotiated cuts of all of the possible paths for Iran to get a nuclear weapon.</p><p end="901" is_meta="false" speaker="Philip Gordon" start="840">Now, in this brief opening sta tement, this is not the place for a very detailed analysis of every provision in the agreement .</p><p end="967" is_meta="false" speaker="Philip Gordon" start="901">I suspect most of you have already read it and are familiar with it . What I would do is underscore some of what this agreement does . And I would ask you to think about it in these terms: Imagine the world before us with the agreement, if we get it finalized and we implement it, and imagine the world without the agreement . Think about those two alternatives -- alternative worlds for the future and ask yourself which one you want to live in, which one is good for America.</p><p end="967" is_meta="false" speaker="Philip Gordon" start="901">I said the deal cuts off all of the possible paths to an Iranian nuclear weapon. There are three basic paths: Enriching uranium to be able to use it for a bomb, usi ng plutonium to create a nuclear weapon, or a covert path . And this agreement stops all of those tracks .</p><p end="967" is_meta="false" speaker="Philip Gordon" start="901">On enrichment, what does the agreement do ? With the agreement, Iran would have to take its current stockpile of low enriched uranium, which is aroun d 10,000 kilograms or 12 tons, enough for several nuclear weapons today, a s we discussed this, and get rid of 98 percent of it, keep only 300 kilograms .</p><p end="1017" is_meta="false" speaker="Philip Gordon" start="967">Without it, they could have whatever stockpile they like . With this agreement, they w ould have to get rid of two -thirds of their installed centrifuges . Today they have 20,000 installed centrifuges . With this agreement, it would have to go down to 6,000, of which only 5,000 could be operating for 10 years . And they would all have to be theoldest technology, the least efficient. Without it, they can operate whatever centrifuges they like . With the agreement, they would have to stop all of their enrichment at an underground facility called Fordo w and they could only keep nonoperating ce ntrifuges there . Without the agreement, they can use Fordo w for whatever they like . With the agreement, Iran couldn &#8217;t use its more advanced centrifuges to do enrichment for 10 years and would have long -term limits on research and development .</p><p end="1083" is_meta="false" speaker="Philip Gordon" start="1017">Without the ag reement, they can do whatever R&amp; D they want and develop more advanced centrifuges very quickly . With this agreement, Iran could not enrich uranium to 20 percent, the level, if you recall, when the Israeli prime minister was here in New Yor k a couple of years ago, he identified as the most concerning thing . So if you enrich uranium to 20 percent, it &#8217;s a short step away from 90 percent and the ability to use it for a bomb . The interim agreement that we negotiated got rid of that 20 percent stockpile, this agreement requires Iran to not enrich at all to 20 percent, clos es off all the potential paths to highly enriched uranium for a bomb. It also closes off the plutonium path. With the agreement, Iran has to get rid of its current heavy water reactor at a place called Arak and replace it with one that would not produce any weapons -grade plutonium at all. And it couldn&#8217; t do any reprocessing. It has to ship the core out and can &#8217;t use this site . Without the agreement, they can fini sh production of that heavy water reactor and start producing weapons -grade plutonium .</p><p end="1141" is_meta="false" speaker="Philip Gordon" start="1083">Finally, and maybe most importantly, this blocks the covert path . With this agreement in place, Iran would be bound to accept unprecedented intrusive inspections , forever,</p><p end="1141" is_meta="false" speaker="Philip Gordon" start="1083">with a mechanism for resolving disputes . We would have access to their entire fuel cycle from the mines and mills of uranium to production sites for centrifuges all the way to the enrichment sites themselves where there would be cameras and inspectors on a regular basis . That &#8217;s what we have if we get this agreement, if we conclude this agreement . Without this agreemen t, we don&#8217;t have any of that, a nd we have no idea what Iran is up to . The bottom line of all that, when you put it all t ogether, is Iran&#8217;s breakout timeline, the amount of time it would take them to get enough material for a bomb, goes from around two months, what it is today, to over a year, which our military specialists are confident give us enough time to react if they seek to violate it .</p><p end="1202" is_meta="false" speaker="Philip Gordon" start="1141">I could go on, but you get the bottom line point. When you compare these two worlds that we could live in with the agreement or without the agreement, clearly, this agreement is good for the United States . Indeed, I think it &#8217;s not even a close call. When Tom takes the floor -- I &#8217;ve made the positive case for this agreement . When Tom takes the floor, he &#8217;ll be able to talk about some of the reasons why not only is this a goodagreement, but all of the potential alternative s to it are much, much worse . Thank you very much.</p><p end="1202" is_meta="false" speaker="Michael Doran" start="1141">Thank you. Thank you, John, and thanks to all of you. It &#8217;s fantastic to be here. There&#8217;s nothing more wonderful than Central Park in the springtime except the IQ2 debate.</p><p end="1259" is_meta="true" speaker="Michael Doran" start="1202">laughter</p><p end="1259" is_meta="false" speaker="Michael Doran" start="1202">Now, as you know, we &#8217;re going to argue -- M ark and I are going to argue against . We think this is a very bad deal . Let me just get right to the point. To me, this is like -- say you &#8217;re a legitimate businessman, and a Mafioso comes and you &#8217;re in a little bit of --</p><p end="1259" is_meta="false" speaker="Michael Doran" start="1202">you &#8217;re in a little bit of trouble financially, and he offers you a loan, and you take it, and you tell you rself that this is a temporary thing and that as the Mafioso becomes your partner, over time, he &#8217;s going to moderate, he &#8217;s going to understand what it&#8217;s like to get honest profits, and he &#8217;s going to change, and he &#8217;s going to start abiding by the law . This agreement would be fantastic if we were making this agreement with Denmark, but we &#8217;re not . We&#8217;re making it with Iran . We know Iran well. We&#8217;ve known them for 35 years . We know what they &#8217;re like. The Iran that we have today is the Iran that we had 10 years ago . It&#8217;s the Iran that we had 20 years ago . It&#8217;s the Iran that we had 35 years ago .</p><p end="-34673" is_meta="false" speaker="Michael Doran" start="1259">And that&#8217;s -- that is actually the single most important question that I want to put to you tonight is, why do we think that this regime is going to abide by this agreement ? That &#8217;s the -- that is the single most important -- the single most important question, and the administration never, ever -- never ever talks about it .Now, there are two stories out there that are being told. One is the story that the Obama administration is telling, and the other story is the one that our allies in the Middle East are telling . The story the Obama administration is telling us goes something like this: Back in -- back in April of 2013, there was an election i n Iran which brought to power this guy Rouhani, who is a reformer. And Rouhani wanted to change relations with the West. He wanted to change all of this enmity and conflict between Iran and the West. And so he started this negotiation with the Americans , and he made some very important concessions to the Americans, concessions that they had never made,</p><p end="-34673" is_meta="false" speaker="Michael Doran" start="1259">along the lines of the ones that Phil was talking about, basically the essence was a willingness to constrain their nuclear -- their nuclear program.</p><p end="-34673" is_meta="false" speaker="Michael Doran" start="1259">1</p><p end="1383" is_meta="false" speaker="Michael Doran" start="-34673">And that then has led to this process that we have here before us today . That&#8217;s not the stor y that our allies are telling . They &#8217;re saying that this process is not the result of a strategic change in Iran . It&#8217;s the result of a strateg ic change in Washington. The United States -- the United States started this process with major concessions . It ripped up six Security Council resolutions that called for zero reprocessing and zero enrichment . It gave Iran, in the first step, as part of the interim agreement, it gave it the right to enrich,</p><p end="1383" is_meta="false" speaker="Michael Doran" start="-34673">and it said also that the restrictions on its program would be temporary, right ? So the negotiation after that -- after the initial interim agreement and the negotiations were over how long wo uld that period of temporary restriction be ? And under what -- how big would the restrictions on the -- on the program be ?</p><p end="1439" is_meta="false" speaker="Michael Doran" start="1383">And what would Iran get in return ? Now, just for signing up to the interim agreement,</p><p end="1439" is_meta="false" speaker="Michael Doran" start="1383">we started paying Iran $700 million a month . We &#8217;re paying them to negotiate with us .</p><p end="1439" is_meta="false" speaker="Michael Doran" start="1383">We &#8217;re going to -- when they sign the deal, we &#8217;re going to give them $50 billion right up front and shortly thereafter and additional $ 70 to $90 billion. Now, when you ask John Kerry, what &#8217;s the evidence that there &#8217;s been a strategic change on the part of the Iranian regime ? He says, &#8220; Well, look, they signed the interim agreement, and they have negotiate d for over a year now with us, and they have abided by the terms of the interim agreement duri ng this period of negotiation. &#8221; We paid them to do that . We paid them to do that, and we have dangled out a big prize at the end of this signing bonus and the relief from -- and the relief from all sanctions . So, of course, they&#8217;re going to be -- they&#8217;re going to play nice at the negotiating table .</p><p end="1504" is_meta="false" speaker="Michael Doran" start="1439">What other evidence do we have other than the fact that they have allowed us to pay them to negotiate with us, that they have made a strategic shift? No evidence whatsoever . They still are the -- they still spout the same anti -Semitic rhetoric, they stillcall for the destruction of Israel, they still destabilize their neighbors . They still have four Americans who are hostage there . They have a Marine, they have a cleric, they have a newspaper reporter, and they have a former FBI agent . They didn&#8217;t even have the -- they didn &#8217;t have -- they didn&#8217;t even have the grace and the good manners to release the hostages during this -- during this negotiation.</p><p end="1504" is_meta="false" speaker="Michael Doran" start="1439">Now, Mark and I are going to divide our duties here . Mark is going to explain to you why all of those characteristics of the deal that Phil went through are basically a fiction,</p><p end="1504" is_meta="false" speaker="Michael Doran" start="1439">why it &#8217;s a fantasy to think that any of this -- that the Iranians will abide by any of these --</p><p end="1504" is_meta="false" speaker="Michael Doran" start="1439">by any of these terms that Phil mentioned . I am just going to make a couple of statements about the broader problem of the deal in the region.</p><p end="1565" is_meta="false" speaker="Michael Doran" start="1504">Mark &#8217;s going to talk about the nuclear breakout. I&#8217;m going to talk about the regional breakout . We are turning -- with this deal, we are turning Iran into the regional hegemon in the Middle East, all right ? We have turned a blind eye to the expansion of Iranian power in Iraq, in Syria, in Yemen, and elsewhere across the region . And when we hand them $50 billion a few mon ths from now, if, in fact, we do, we&#8217;re going to see an expansion of those -- an expansion of those activities . That &#8217;s one problem . Another problem is we have set off with this deal a regional nuclear arms race . The Saudis have said openly, explicitly, that they are going to match the Iranians capability for capability .</p><p end="1565" is_meta="false" speaker="Michael Doran" start="1504">They &#8217;re not going to wait for this deal to end before they start developing their own capability, and they have made that explicit . There&#8217;s no way to deny, absolutely no way to deny, th at there is not a regional nuclear arms race underway right now .</p><p end="1619" is_meta="false" speaker="Michael Doran" start="1565">The other thing is this deal does not make the United States any safer . One of the things that has been left off the table, not part of the negotiations, is the illegal ballisti c missiles program of the Iranians . So before long we &#8217;re going to have an Iran -- a nuclear Iran with a ballistic missile capability capable of hitting the United States .</p><p end="1619" is_meta="false" speaker="Michael Doran" start="1565">A good deal, a good deal -- and this is what we need to define -- a good deal is one that stops Iran from getting a nuclear weapon, A ; B, makes our allies in the region feel safer and stabilizes the region; and, three, makes the United States safer . This deal does not meet that basic criteria. Thank you.</p><p end="1686" is_meta="false" speaker="Thomas Pickering" start="1619">Thank you, John, and thank you for your warm welcome . It&#8217;s a pleasure to be h ere with Phil and also with Mike and Mark . I have much I think to say tonight in a very short period of time, and I will do what I can to compress it . Not too long ago when he was still alive, Daniel Patrick Moynihan said famously that, &#8220;You &#8217;re each enti tled to your own opinion but not your own set of facts. &#8221; Tonight from Mr. Doran we&#8217;ve heard an extremely interesting, unusual, and strange set of facts .</p><p end="1745" is_meta="false" speaker="Thomas Pickering" start="1686">So let me just cover a few of those that I think will be helpful to your understanding of</p><p end="1745" is_meta="false" speaker="Thomas Pickering" start="1686">the arrangements that we have to deal with.</p><p end="1745" is_meta="false" speaker="Thomas Pickering" start="1686">First and foremost is the notion in his part that somehow $50 billion will pass on the moment of signature . The truth is, of course, that until Iran complies with four major requirements of the deal -- tha t they put their centrifuges aside ; that they change their stockpile from 10,000 kilograms to 300 kilograms ; that they, in fact, dismantle the central piece of the reactor that can make plutonium ; and that they agree on that the past efforts that the y made in a nuclear direction , in a nuclear weapons direction , are fully explained to and satisfactorily explained to the Int ernational Atomic Energy Agency -- they get nothing out of this deal .</p><p end="1796" is_meta="false" speaker="Thomas Pickering" start="1745">N o sanctions relief until those particular steps take place, no money passes hands to Iran.Secondly, the notion that Iran is somehow going to enjoy, when it does get this money,</p><p end="1796" is_meta="false" speaker="Thomas Pickering" start="1745">the opportunity to play havoc in the Middle East is both strange and unusual . Certainly we watch carefully what Iran does . And none of us have undertaken the notion that the Iranians are angels, that the whole agreement is indeed put together with very strong inspection mechanisms well beyond what you have ever seen before in any country around the world in order to prevent the kind of cheating or indeed the kind of misuse of the agreement for narrow political advantage .</p><p end="1860" is_meta="false" speaker="Thomas Pickering" start="1796">Were the Iranians, in fact, going to misuse this money, the y would have far done it well before an y receipts from sanctions relief, their priorities for the things that they &#8217;re doing in the region are high enough, I think, for them to continue to do that. It is important,</p><p end="1860" is_meta="false" speaker="Thomas Pickering" start="1796">too, to remember this is a nuclear agreement, not a ballistic missile agreement . Both sides have agreed on the importance of the nuclear agreement as a matter of priority .</p><p end="1860" is_meta="false" speaker="Thomas Pickering" start="1796">Obviously, a missile -- ballistic missile without a nuclear warhead is not the kind of threat that has been portrayed to you here . And there are plenty of opportunities in the next set of agreements, if this one is successfully concluded, to move on to that particular effort .</p><p end="1860" is_meta="false" speaker="Thomas Pickering" start="1796">Now, let me turn, if I can, to the key questions, a nd they&#8217;re important to all of us here .</p><p end="1860" is_meta="false" speaker="Thomas Pickering" start="1796">You &#8217;ve already understood that both sides share a deep sense of the necessity to stop any Iranian nuclear weapon . That &#8217;s stipulated and agree d.</p><p end="1913" is_meta="false" speaker="Thomas Pickering" start="1860">It &#8217;s important, however, to understand that the second question -- is this a good deal for America -- is one that we would certainly answer in the positive for a whole set of reasons that Phil set out for you. And the third question is, what are the alternatives to this deal ? Well, the alternatives, quite starkly and quite frankly, are two : n o deal at all,</p><p end="1913" is_meta="false" speaker="Thomas Pickering" start="1860">or an attempt to use sanctions to see if, in fact, we can achieve a better deal . You heard from Mr. Doran that he would like to have zero enrichment. I would like to have zero enrichment, too . I&#8217;d like to be a billionaire .</p><p end="1913" is_meta="true" speaker="Thomas Pickering" start="1860">laughter</p><p end="1913" is_meta="false" speaker="Thomas Pickering" start="1860">I &#8217;d like to believe in the Tooth Fairy . But for 14 years, previous administrations attempted to negotiate for zero enrichment, and got nowhere .</p><p end="1986" is_meta="false" speaker="Thomas Pickering" start="1913">And the value of zero enrichment, in my view, is not significant compared to the value of the arrangement that we now have on the table, with all of its inspectionmechanisms, and with al l of its limitations on Iran, and that &#8217;s extremely important to keep in mind .</p><p end="1986" is_meta="false" speaker="Thomas Pickering" start="1913">In addition to that, what would happen if we walked away from an agreement? How and in what way would that affect the situation? It would affect it very badly . We would have turned down what our allies joined us in negotiating . The notion that we could achieve effective additional sanctions without friends, allies, and indeed, without</p><p end="1986" is_meta="false" speaker="Thomas Pickering" start="1913">the participation of the world community, is well beyond reality . It&#8217;s not there and it&#8217;s not [unintelligible] . The third question is, what would happen in the event we had no agreement . Iran, of course, could move freely to a nuclear weapon . They wou ld have two to three months to breakout time . They would, if they -- they &#8217;re so inclined, use that opportunity, as we have a 10 -year agreement with a 15 -year limitation on the production of more than 300 kilograms of low -enriched uranium to hold them in place,</p><p end="1986" is_meta="false" speaker="Thomas Pickering" start="1913">and I think that&#8217;s important.</p><p end="2041" is_meta="false" speaker="Thomas Pickering" start="1986">Finally, I think it &#8217;s significant that you understand that the alternatives to an agreement may well involve the necessity to use force under conditions where we would be highly isolated, having turned down the kind of agreement we participated centrally in negotiating -- a good agreement . If we were to use force, it would mean, I think, from the best judgment that I can get of military officials, a three to five-year cessation in the Iranian agreement before they could move back to where they are now. And a situation under which we would have to bomb pretty continuously to keep the Iranians under that kind of stricture and under that kind of pressure . To me, there is no alternative .</p><p end="2041" is_meta="false" speaker="Thomas Pickering" start="1986">This agreement is a good one . I hope that you will consider that carefully .</p><p end="2100" is_meta="false" speaker="Thomas Pickering" start="2041">And when the time comes to push your little button, push the button in the right order for the right set of arrangements that President Obama has put before you. Thank you very much .</p><p end="2100" is_meta="true" speaker="Thomas Pickering" start="2041">applause</p><p end="2699" is_meta="false" speaker="Philip Gordon" start="2650">Yeah . I will start . But, frankly, I don&#8217;t know where to start, given what we heard about this agreement, speaking of Tooth Fairies . I don &#8217;t get all of my predictions right . I&#8217;m probably wrong most of the time . But when I stood up there a few minutes ago and predicted that what we wouldn &#8217;t hear was an alternative path to get somewhere,</p><p end="2699" is_meta="false" speaker="Philip Gordon" start="2650">instead we just hear a litany of the things that we would love to see if we could write itourselves, I got that prediction right . And, Mark, I think you misunderstood my challenge . My challenge wasn &#8217;t to describe a better deal. I can describe a better deal,</p><p end="2699" is_meta="false" speaker="Philip Gordon" start="2650">and you did a great job of it. I love your deal. I &#8217;d sign it right now . I can describe the salary package that Tom would have if he was a billionaire .</p><p end="2699" is_meta="true" speaker="Philip Gordon" start="2650">laughter</p><p end="2752" is_meta="false" speaker="Philip Gordon" start="2699">What I can &#8217;t do is tell him how to get there . And that&#8217;s what you didn &#8217;t tell us, how to get that better deal.</p><p end="2752" is_meta="false" speaker="Michael Doran" start="2699">The agreement doesn &#8217;t have binding restrictions . This is the -- the reason that we have gotten any compliance out of the Iranians th us far is because we &#8217;re paying them to do it.</p><p end="2819" is_meta="false" speaker="Michael Doran" start="2752">The -- you know, Tom mentioned that the agreement is going to require the Iranians to come clean on all of their past program, which is an incredibly important aspect of the monitoring mechanism. Unless you understand what the program was, you can &#8217;t monit or it. The fact of the matter is the Iranians have stiffed the IAEA for a decade about this . We have not stood firm on it. We have not forced them to come clean on their past program. And the agreement that we got from them about that is that, yes,</p><p end="2819" is_meta="false" speaker="Michael Doran" start="2752">the y will address that question in the future . I&#8217;m willing to bet anything -- I&#8217;m going to make a prediction right here, Phil. And my prediction is that if this deal is signed, we &#8217;re going to give them sanctions relief before they ever come clean on their p ast program,</p><p end="2819" is_meta="false" speaker="Michael Doran" start="2752">because they have never ever come clean and they &#8217;re not going to let us into military sites.</p><p end="2819" is_meta="false" speaker="Thomas Pickering" start="2752">Look, let me offer you the facts, not your imagination, not your predictions --</p><p end="2943" is_meta="false" speaker="Thomas Pickering" start="2819">-- these are the facts --</p><p end="2943" is_meta="false" speaker="Thomas Pickering" start="2819">-- yes, of course they have . They&#8217;ve started.</p><p end="2943" is_meta="false" speaker="Thomas Pickering" start="2819">They &#8217;ve started.</p><p end="2943" is_meta="false" speaker="Thomas Pickering" start="2819">-- conclude the release of sanctions until they have come clean with the IAEA . That&#8217;s an indisputable negotiating objective of the United States . That &#8217;s what we have said we will agree to, nothing less . And so that&#8217;s -- you &#8217;re sitting here making up fairy stories about what it is that&#8217;s going to be agreed or not agreed . Nobody that I know o f, when the framework came out on April 2nd, who knows anything about this agreement was not surprised by the degree to which Iran had come in our directions, including, I have to tell you, a number of very senior Iranians . The notion that somehow we have been snookered or somehow that this process will not work , totally defeats the fact that throughout the Cold War we made a whole series of agreements with the Soviet Union.</p><p end="2943" is_meta="false" speaker="Thomas Pickering" start="2819">President Reagan said in his best Russian, &#8220; Doveryai, no proveryai,&#8221; &#8220; Trust but v erify.&#8221;</p><p end="2943" is_meta="false" speaker="Thomas Pickering" start="2819">That &#8217;s the basis of this agreement.</p><p end="2943" is_meta="false" speaker="Thomas Pickering" start="2819">This is nothing new here.</p><p end="2943" is_meta="false" speaker="Mark Dubowitz" start="2819">Yeah . Tom, it &#8217;s interesting . I mean, you know, these are stories you tell childre n to keep the nightmares away, that, &#8220; Don&#8217;t worry, the Iranians will come clean . Don&#8217;t worry, the Iranians have come clean. &#8221; But, Tom, you know better than anybody that the Iranians have been stonewalling the IAEA for years . There are 12 outstanding questions about past and possibly continuing military dimensions of the Iranian program. The head of the IAEA has made it very clear that he is deeply frustrated that Iran refuses to answer those 12 questions . They &#8217;ve answered half of one, Tom . Half of one is not answering the questions . There are 11 and a half outstanding questions . We also know that the administration will give sanctions relief based on Iranian nuclear compliance, and that includes centrifuges, it includes Fordow , it includes some of the nuclear elements of this.</p><p end="3003" is_meta="false" speaker="Thomas Pickering" start="2943">Just not accurate, Mark.</p><p end="3003" is_meta="false" speaker="Mark Dubowitz" start="2943">And you know what?</p><p end="3003" is_meta="false" speaker="Thomas Pickering" start="2943">They&#8217;ve already come on 8 according to the IAEA, but let &#8217;s not argue about the details.</p><p end="3003" is_meta="false" speaker="Mark Dubowitz" start="2943">[inaudible] 12, Tom, half of 12.</p><p end="3003" is_meta="false" speaker="Thomas Pickering" start="2943">Let &#8217;s argue about the notion that they cannot get sanctions relief until they do.</p><p end="3003" is_meta="false" speaker="Mark Dubowitz" start="2943">But, Tom, they already have gotten sanctions relief . They &#8217;ve gotten $11.9 billion in oil escrow funds that have returned to them since November 2013 . They &#8217;ve gotten petrochemical sanctions relief . They &#8217;ve gotten auto sanctions relief. Their economy --</p><p end="3003" is_meta="false" speaker="Mark Dubowitz" start="2943">Tom, their economy was on its back in 2013 --</p><p end="3003" is_meta="false" speaker="Thomas Pickering" start="2943">That &#8217;s in return for the joint program of action .</p><p end="3003" is_meta="false" speaker="Mark Dubowitz" start="2943">-- but they came -- but they got sanctions relief before they ever came clean on weaponization, which completely contradicts your thesis.</p><p end="3003" is_meta="false" speaker="Thomas Pickering" start="2943">But that&#8217;s --</p><p end="3054" is_meta="false" speaker="Mark Dubowitz" start="3003">And so, here &#8217;s the problem.</p><p end="3054" is_meta="false" speaker="Mark Dubowitz" start="3003">Because you &#8217;re getting the economics wrong here.</p><p end="3054" is_meta="false" speaker="Michael Doran" start="3003">Let me shift it a little bit and just --</p><p end="3054" is_meta="false" speaker="Michael Doran" start="3003">-- say that, you know, Tom said what I want is a fantasy . I want zero enrichment, zero reprocessing . That&#8217;s not what I want.</p><p end="3123" is_meta="false" speaker="Michael Doran" start="3054">Oh, no, no, no, no --</p><p end="3123" is_meta="false" speaker="Michael Doran" start="3054">No, no, no, no -- we -- listen . I have it from European partners to the negotiations that they have been shocked by the giveaway . The idea that we are responding, that we are responding to the demands of allies is simply not true . This has been a bilaterally ne gotiated deal.</p><p end="3123" is_meta="false" speaker="Michael Doran" start="3054">-- by the desire for detente with Iran. The president has sold the world on the notion that he is -- that what he &#8217;s trying to do is get a nuclear arms agreement . What he is --</p><p end="3123" is_meta="false" speaker="Michael Doran" start="3054">his strategic goal is to have detente with Iran, and he &#8217;s using the arms control agreement as the vehicle --</p><p end="3123" is_meta="false" speaker="Michael Doran" start="3054">-- for getting it.</p><p end="3123" is_meta="false" speaker="Thomas Pickering" start="3054">The way that --</p><p end="3123" is_meta="false" speaker="Thomas Pickering" start="3054">-- European allies -- the Russians, the Chinese, the Brits, the French, and the Germans have been with us .

That &#8217;s a tricky one for me.</p><p end="3240" is_meta="false" speaker="Michael Doran" start="3173">Well, that -- the fact is --</p><p end="3240" is_meta="false" speaker="Philip Gordon" start="3173">Sure, the Russians are totally compliant --</p><p end="3240" is_meta="false" speaker="Mark Dubowitz" start="3173">The European --</p><p end="3240" is_meta="false" speaker="Philip Gordon" start="3173">-- [unintelligible] runaway train .</p><p end="3240" is_meta="true" speaker="Philip Gordon" start="3173">laughter</p><p end="3240" is_meta="true" speaker="Philip Gordon" start="3173">unintelligible</p><p end="3240" is_meta="false" speaker="Mark Dubowitz" start="3173">The Europeans have told me -- the Europeans have told me their biggest nightmare,</p><p end="3240" is_meta="false" speaker="Mark Dubowitz" start="3173">okay, is U.S. negotiators at one minute to midnight in a room with the Iranian negotiators . And they believe at that point, major concessions come . And listen, major concessions have come, Phil. The fact of the matter is Iran&#8217;s economy was on its back in 2013 as a result of sanctions . As a result of sanctions relief that your administration --</p><p end="3240" is_meta="false" speaker="Mark Dubowitz" start="3173">that you were in -- negotiated , the economy is on its knees getting up to its feet. We &#8217;ve lost economic leverage . Iran went from a severe recession to a modest recovery . When you l ose peaceful economic leverage, you lose the ability to actually negotiate strong nuclear concessions . And when you lose peaceful economic leverage in a post -deal</p><p end="3240" is_meta="false" speaker="Mark Dubowitz" start="3173">environment, you have no way to enforce this deal. And then you have to use military force to enforce this deal, which is something nobody at this table wants.</p><p end="3240" is_meta="false" speaker="Thomas Pickering" start="3173">-- of their economy --</p><p end="3305" is_meta="false" speaker="Thomas Pickering" start="3240">-- one percent changed their economy.</p><p end="3305" is_meta="false" speaker="Philip Gordon" start="3240">We agree on sanctions, Mark, at least that part of it . That&#8217;s why they agreed to this deal that required them to do so many things that they didn &#8217;t want to do . You &#8217;re right . The ir economy is on its back . It&#8217;s because of the sanctions that we put together, together with our allies . And that&#8217;s how we got this deal.</p><p end="3305" is_meta="false" speaker="Mark Dubowitz" start="3240">And then you diminish the pressure.</p><p end="3305" is_meta="false" speaker="Michael Doran" start="3240">[inaudible] --</p><p end="3305" is_meta="false" speaker="Mark Dubowitz" start="3240">Then you [unintelligible] the negotiations --</p><p end="3305" is_meta="false" speaker="Mark Dubowitz" start="3240">-- and diminish the pressure, and you gave on key nuclear demands, and that&#8217;s why --</p><p end="3305" is_meta="false" speaker="Michael Doran" start="3240">That was out of affection.</p><p end="3305" is_meta="false" speaker="Michael Doran" start="3240">Mark was nice . Mark toned down the story a little bit. The story that he heard was,</p><p end="3305" is_meta="false" speaker="Michael Doran" start="3240">&#8220; Our nightmare &#8221; -- this is from our European allies . &#8220;Our nightmare is that Zarif and Kerry are in a hotel room, and it &#8217;s one minute to midnight, and there &#8217;s a -- then there &#8217;s a deadlin e.&#8221; That &#8217;s what they said. Now, the story that the Obama Administration told when it signed the interim agreement, is it said, &#8220; Oh, the Supreme Leader is under such economic pressure, he &#8217;s dying for an agreement .</p><p end="3359" is_meta="false" speaker="Michael Doran" start="3305">What he needs from us is a face -saving agreement . A face-saving agreement . So, we &#8217;re going to rip up these Security Council resolutions, zero enrichment, zero reprocessing,</p><p end="3359" is_meta="false" speaker="Michael Doran" start="3305">and we are going to -- we are going to give him a face -saving nuclear enrichment program of 1,000 centrifuges. &#8221; And then I heard from our European allies, a little bit later t he Americans came and said, &#8220; It &#8217;s not going to be 1,000, it &#8217;s going to be 3,000.&#8221; A little bit later they came and said, &#8220; No, 4,500. &#8221; Now it &#8217;s 6,104. And that&#8217;s why I can sit here and I can tell you, with absolute certainty, and I will be correct on this, there has been a pattern of concession, unilateral concession from the United States, and in forcing our partners along, and in the end --</p><p end="3359" is_meta="false" speaker="Mark Dubowitz" start="3305">-- the Iranians won &#8217;t come clean, and we &#8217;ll give them sanctions relief.</p><p end="3359" is_meta="false" speaker="Thomas Pickering" start="3305">Look, your predictions are your predictions .</p><p end="3423" is_meta="false" speaker="Thomas Pickering" start="3359">They have nothing to do with the framework . They have nothing to do with what we now have in hand, and they have nothing to do with what is now being currently negotiated as the final language of the agreement, which I am told is moving well . So if you want to believe the Tooth Fairy, if you want to believe the worst of a ll possible predictions, there&#8217; s your choice. But it&#8217;s not up on the board. You&#8217;re not voting for anything but the Obama proposal at the present time or some alternative imaginary set of ideas . We constantly have asked, how is it that you would get done what it is you want to get done ? And why is what you want to get done so much more worthwhile in the process of moving ahead ? Everybody knows they negotiated for a house here in this room . How many in this room have ne gotiated for a house? Everybody knows your first bid is not the acceptable answer to what it is you get.</p><p end="3481" is_meta="false" speaker="Thomas Pickering" start="3423">It &#8217;s plain and simple.</p><p end="3481" is_meta="true" speaker="Thomas Pickering" start="3423">laughter</p><p end="3481" is_meta="false" speaker="Mark Dubowitz" start="3423">Well, here &#8217;s the problem . We have outlined a better deal . And one of the key elements of a better deal is that the restrictions of the Obama administration of putting on this program are not going to expire after 15 years . I mean, 15 years. So let me ask how many of you are remember 9/ 11? 9/11 was 14 years ago . How many of you have kids ?</p><p end="3481" is_meta="false" speaker="Mark Dubowitz" start="3423">All right, college senior was in first grade 15 years ago . And parents know that in geopolitics, as in life, 15 years is a blip in time . In 15 years, most of these restrictions aregoing to vanish . Iran will have an industrial sized program. It&#8217;ll have zero breakout .</p><p end="3481" is_meta="false" speaker="Mark Dubowitz" start="3423">Zero breakout is undetectable breakout. Tom, we can negotiate a better deal by making one simple modification to the Obama deal .</p><p end="3544" is_meta="false" speaker="Mark Dubowitz" start="3481">And that is that the restrictions will not sunset. They will not disappear until the International Atomic Energy Agency has reached a broader conclusion that Iran&#8217;s nuclear program is only for peaceful purposes and there are no clandestine activities,</p><p end="3544" is_meta="false" speaker="Mark Dubowitz" start="3481">which why not demand that?</p><p end="3598" is_meta="false" speaker="Mark Dubowitz" start="3544">No, you &#8217;re mischaracterizing . The IAEA could reach that broader conclusion in five years . They could reach it in seven years . All Iran has to do is declare to the IAEA that we have no clandestine facilities, we have no clandestine activities, and the IAEA reaches a broader conclusion that it has done so with 60 countries, to say this is a peaceful program. So this is not about eternity . This is not about the Tooth Fairy. This is about a restriction --</p><p end="3598" is_meta="false" speaker="Mark Dubowitz" start="3544">Philip Gordon:But you&#8217; re -- you &#8217;re [unintelligible] now for eternity.</p><p end="3598" is_meta="false" speaker="Mark Dubowitz" start="3544">It could be five --</p><p end="3598" is_meta="false" speaker="Philip Gordon" start="3544">Last point about it.</p><p end="3598" is_meta="false" speaker="Mark Dubowitz" start="3544">Phil, it could be five years . It could be seven years.</p><p end="3663" is_meta="false" speaker="Philip Gordon" start="3598">No, no . If the agreement says --</p><p end="3663" is_meta="false" speaker="Mark Dubowitz" start="3598">Peaceful nature of the program.</p><p end="3663" is_meta="false" speaker="Mark Dubowitz" start="3598">Peaceful . Phil, peaceful.</p><p end="3663" is_meta="false" speaker="Thomas Pickering" start="3598">The question, please, before they start my 30 seconds . What question --</p><p end="3663" is_meta="false" speaker="Thomas Pickering" start="3598">John Donvan:Oh, you were -- well, [unintelligible] so you were responding to your opponent.</p><p end="3783" is_meta="false" speaker="Michael Doran" start="3663">You get -- you don&#8217;t --</p><p end="3783" is_meta="false" speaker="Michael Doran" start="3663">You don &#8217;t get a couple of decades . You don&#8217;t get 10 years, you don &#8217;t get 15 years. You have an agreement . You have a Mafioso who &#8217;s going to sign an agreement, is going to say he &#8217;s going to abide by certain restrictions for 10 or 15 years . But all of the leverage that we have, other than military force, we are giving up on the front end of the -- on the front end of the deal . We&#8217;re paying them to sign this . We are paying to say that they will be good citizens for 10 or 15 years . And then you&#8217;re coming to me and saying that we &#8217;ve got this in hand. This is the way -- this is the Iran that we &#8217;re going to be dealing with for the next 10 or 15 years is not the one that we &#8217;ve been dealing with for the last 35.</p><p end="3783" is_meta="true" speaker="Michael Doran" start="3663">bell sounds</p><p end="3783" is_meta="false" speaker="Thomas Pickering" start="3663">Pieces of thi s deal last forever, including the fact that Iran is obligated not to do anything to move toward nuclear weapons . Secondly, the additional inspection protocol stays on forever . So those are very important because they will signal to us plenty early as to whether the Iranians are keeping their commitments or staying out of the nuclear weapons business as we go ahead. And it&#8217;s important that we have those to guarantee the process is moving ahead . And we have the force at the end of the day if they violate this agreement.[laughter]</p><p end="3783" is_meta="false" speaker="Mark Dubowitz" start="3663">Here &#8217;s the problem: If I &#8217;m Iran, here&#8217;s what I do. I comply with the agreement for the first few years . I get my sanctions relief . I get the billions of dollars returned to me . I build my economy. I rebuild my economy . I create economic immunity against future economic pressure . I am a good boy for the first few years, and then I start to cheat.</p><p end="3783" is_meta="false" speaker="Mark Dubowitz" start="3663">But I cheat incrementally, not egregiously, even the sum total of my incremental cheating will always be egregious if I &#8217;m an Iranian regime. And I will then wait until those restrictions start to disappear, year 10, year 13, year 15, year 20.</p><p end="3840" is_meta="true" speaker="Mark Dubowitz" start="3783">bell sounds</p><p end="3902" is_meta="false" speaker="Thomas Pickering" start="3840">You want to take it?</p><p end="3902" is_meta="false" speaker="Thomas Pickering" start="3840">[unintelligible].</p><p end="3902" is_meta="false" speaker="Philip Gordon" start="3840">Yeah, sure.</p><p end="4018" is_meta="false" speaker="Thomas Pickering" start="3902">Thank you.</p><p end="4018" is_meta="false" speaker="Philip Gordon" start="3902">Look, Iran having access to its frozen funds is not something we would welcome . We&#8217;ve been very clear, the administration has been very clear that Iran is a destabilizing factor in the region . It&#8217;s a state supporter of terrorism , and we don&#8217;t want to see the Iranian regime have more money at its disposable to pursue some of these activities . But as Tom reminded the group earlier on, this is a nuclear agreement . The reason these specific sanctions are in place -- the only reason we got the rest of the world to join these sanctions -- and, by the way, it was only when the rest of the world joined them that they became effective -- is that they were focused on Iran&#8217;s nuclear weapons program. Now, it seems to me what our opponents are suggest ing here, or those who don &#8217;t want to move ahead with this deal, is that we focused it on the nuclear program to get international support for the sanctions, we brought down the Iranian economy,</p><p end="4018" is_meta="false" speaker="Philip Gordon" start="3902">and then in the 11th hour we say, &#8220; Oh, by the way, even though we &#8217;ve gotten what we want on the nuclear side, let&#8217;s keep on the sanctions because we actually now want Iran to stop supporting terrorism, recognize Israel, stop messing around in Yemen -- &#8221; and, let me just be cle ar, I&#8217;m for all of those things .</p><p end="4018" is_meta="false" speaker="Philip Gordon" start="3902">19:53: 07</p><p end="4018" is_meta="false" speaker="Philip Gordon" start="3902">We should be vigorously trying to pursue all of those goals, but the idea that we can just shift gears and say, &#8220; We&#8217;re not even doing the deal until then, &#8221; is a recipe not for getting both a nuclear deal and constraining Iran in the region, it&#8217;s a recipe for getting neither.</p><p end="4018" is_meta="false" speaker="Michael Doran" start="3902">This deal isn &#8217;t a deal about nuclear weapons, but it has profound implications for Iran&#8217;s place in the world . It has profound implications for Iran &#8217;s ability to make mischief around the region . Phil says he and the Obama administration would say as well that they are for doing something about the Iranian backed militias in Iraq, they &#8217;re for stopping Hezbollah from turning South Lebanon into an armed camp. Hezbollah has 100,000 missiles and rockets that can -- that could hit Israel -- what are they doing about it ? They &#8217;re not doing anything about it.</p><p end="4081" is_meta="false" speaker="Michael Doran" start="4018">All of the region, everyone in the region, all of our allies are up in arms, hair on fire about this issue, and the answer is , &#8220;Look, it &#8217;s just a nuclear agreement. &#8221; The only w ay this agreement makes sense, is what Kayvon asked here, is if the Obama administrationbelieves that if it kisses the frog it will turn into a prince, that through this economic --</p><p end="4081" is_meta="false" speaker="Michael Doran" start="4018">through the economic transformation of Iran, through greater relief of sanctions and greater business opportunities Iran is going to miraculously transform into something other than what we know it to be.</p><p end="4081" is_meta="false" speaker="Michael Doran" start="4018">The Iranian regime has -- the Revolutionary Guard Corps has set up front companies that dominate the economy of Iran. They have positioned themselves very well to benefit from this . What we are doing, like I said, is making a deal with the mafia and assuming that it will become a legitimate businessman . There&#8217;s no reason to believe that. Maybe, maybe it could possibly happen, but it is wishful thinking . It is definitely Tooth Fairy thinking.</p><p end="4137" is_meta="false" speaker="Thomas Pickering" start="4081">I think it&#8217;s clear that they will be deeply investe d in being part of the international community from which they have been excluded. So there is no question that at least one possibility is that they will behave and not move toward a nuclear weapon. The other possibility is we will certainly, as I point ed out a minute ago, know if they do. And we will have exactly the same retributive capabilities then as we have now . And in my view that is the arrangement that makes the most sense and the best deal that we have been able to get up until now, and our friends have shown us absolutely no way to improve the deal.</p><p end="4199" is_meta="false" speaker="Thomas Pickering" start="4137">I would love to find ways to improve the deal, but I am totally satisfied that the deal we have now on the table is a deal which we can certainly live with and that we will have every opportunity to assure that Iran does not get a nuclear weapon.</p><p end="4326" is_meta="false" speaker="Thomas Pickering" start="4260">Let me just --</p><p end="4380" is_meta="false" speaker="Michael Doran" start="4326">They &#8217;re not --</p><p end="4380" is_meta="false" speaker="Michael Doran" start="4326">-- the allies are not upset about imaginary things . They allies are upset about militias that the Iranians are running inside Iraq , and that the United States is cooperating with indirectly in fighting the Islamic State . Our airpower comes in, and knocked out the Islamic State of Ramadi, and the Shiite militias controlled by Tehran took it over.</p><p end="4439" is_meta="false" speaker="Michael Doran" start="4380">In Israel, now, we have Iranian forces -- not just Hezbollah, but actually Iranian forces across the border from Israel in Syria. We &#8217;ve got an Iranian proxy, Hezbollah, on Israel&#8217;s northern border . We&#8217;ve got an Israeli proxy, Hamas, in Gaza. We &#8217;ve got Iranians on the -- [inaudible] --</p><p end="4439" is_meta="false" speaker="Michael Doran" start="4380">It &#8217;s a -- it &#8217;s -- Hamas is not as closely controlled as Hezbollah is by Tehran, but the military wing of Hamas is armed and equipped by the Iranians . So, the Israelis are now surrounded by Iranian power . And when you -- when the Israelis or the -- and the Saudis see the Iranians in Yemen, when the Saudis and the Israelis go to the A mericans and they say, &#8220;What &#8217;s your answer to this ? The rise of Iran across the region, &#8221; the --</p><p end="4439" is_meta="false" speaker="Michael Doran" start="4380">what they get is rhetoric . They get President Obama saying, &#8220; We&#8217;re concerned about that. We &#8217;ve got your back . We&#8217;ll help you. &#8221;</p><p end="4498" is_meta="false" speaker="Michael Doran" start="4439">They say to the S audis, &#8220;We &#8217;re going to help you with your intraoperative missile defense, and we &#8217;re going to give you some other capabilities against conventional threat, which doesn&#8217; t even address the issue at all.</p><p end="4498" is_meta="false" speaker="Philip Gordon" start="4439">Might I have a word on that?</p><p end="4498" is_meta="false" speaker="Philip Gordon" start="4439">Just to remind people, the proposition on the table is whether this deal is good for America. Now, a lot of our allies in the region and elsewhere have real concerns about</p><p end="4498" is_meta="false" speaker="Philip Gordon" start="4439">Iran, and so do we . And we stand with them on that . But a lot of our allies in the region would not mind if we went to war against Iran. And we used force in Syria against Iran &#8217;s proxy there . And we stood up and fought militia in Iraq. And that may well be in their interest . The proposition on the table is, is this good for America?</p><p end="4498" is_meta="false" speaker="Michael Doran" start="4439">A destabilized --</p><p end="4498" is_meta="false" speaker="Michael Doran" start="4439">-- Middle East is bad for the United States.</p><p end="4498" is_meta="false" speaker="Michael Doran" start="4439">Mark Dubowitz:Yeah, and Phil, so is prolif eration in the Middle East bad for America. I mean, the Saudis have made it very clear that they want the deal that Iran is going to get. So, the Saudis are going to have a one -year breakout capability, as are the Emiratis . The Turks are going to want that . A deal that was designed to stop proliferation is enabling proliferation .</p><p end="4561" is_meta="false" speaker="Michael Doran" start="4498">A nuclear armed Middle East with nuclear threshold states to turn the screw from a nuclear weapon is bad for America. That&#8217;s why Obama&#8217;s deal is bad for America.</p><p end="4561" is_meta="false" speaker="Thomas Pickering" start="4498">John, we &#8217;ve strayed a long way from that --</p><p end="4561" is_meta="true" speaker="Thomas Pickering" start="4498">laughter</p><p end="4561" is_meta="false" speaker="Thomas Pickering" start="4498">-- but I cannot help to ask --</p><p end="4561" is_meta="false" speaker="Thomas Pickering" start="4498">-- who here has heard of ISIS? Here is Michael suggesting that in fact the Iranian opposition to ISIS is somehow in Iraq a dangerous development for American interests .</p><p end="4561" is_meta="false" speaker="Thomas Pickering" start="4498">That, I find, very hard to jump to that conclusion. I just wanted to make sure that you understood that thinking.</p><p end="4561" is_meta="false" speaker="Michael Doran" start="4498">I want to -- I&#8217;d lik e to explain that.</p><p end="4620" is_meta="false" speaker="Philip Gordon" start="4561">It &#8217;s actually [unintelligible] explanation because there &#8217;s not a great discrepancy. I&#8217;d actua lly urge you to read -- the Belfer Center at Harvard did a really nice comparison of the U.S. fact sheet and what Iranians have been saying, because a lot of people ha ve picked up on this . You know, it &#8217;s a different agreement, and they don&#8217;t really agree to it . Not surprisingly, each side is emphasizing what it gets and minimizing what it &#8217;s giving . And the Iranians are really doing that .</p><p end="4620" is_meta="false" speaker="Philip Gordon" start="4561">But when you actually look at what the Iranians have said, they don&#8217; t take issue with our fact sheet. They &#8217;ve called it &#8220;spin,&#8221; and they &#8217;ve emphasized what they don &#8217;t have to do.</p><p end="4620" is_meta="false" speaker="Philip Gordon" start="4561">But it&#8217;s, I dare say on their side, all spin . Right ?</p><p end="4679" is_meta="false" speaker="Philip Gordon" start="4620">So , you know, they &#8217;ll emphasize all of the things that they &#8217;ll preserve without -- they &#8217;ll have a 300 -kilogram stockpile . This sort of overlooked the fact that they &#8217;re going to give up 98 percent of what they currently have . And they&#8217;ll have 5,000 operating centrifuges . They don &#8217;t emphasize the fact that to get there they have to dismantle more than 5,000 others . So if you actually look at the details of the two sides, you don &#8217;t find a huge gap. You find a huge gap in emphasis, but they don&#8217;t -- they don &#8217;t deny the agreement that we articulated [unintelligible].</p><p end="4679" is_meta="false" speaker="Mark Dubowitz" start="4620">Well, that &#8217;s totally right . There &#8217;s no big gap because Iranians know exactly what they &#8217;re getting . They&#8217;re getting a great deal. They understand that they &#8217;re getting to preserve their entire nuclear infrastructure . They understand that 6,000 centrifuges keep them a year away from breakout.</p><p end="4679" is_meta="false" speaker="Mark Dubowitz" start="4620">Wait a second.</p><p end="4679" is_meta="true" speaker="Mark Dubowitz" start="4620">talking simultaneously</p><p end="4679" is_meta="false" speaker="Thomas Pickering" start="4620">Ninety percent of their low enriched uranium, that&#8217;s their entire infrastructure?</p><p end="4679" is_meta="true" speaker="Mark Dubowitz" start="4620">unintelligible</p><p end="4679" is_meta="true" speaker="Mark Dubowitz" start="4620">talking simultaneously</p><p end="4679" is_meta="false" speaker="Mark Dubowitz" start="4620">I got a fact sheet here.</p><p end="4679" is_meta="false" speaker="Thomas Pickering" start="4620">[unintelligible] centrifuges.</p><p end="4679" is_meta="false" speaker="Mark Dubowitz" start="4620">I got a fact sheet -- Tom.</p><p end="4679" is_meta="true" speaker="Mark Dubowitz" start="4620">talking simultaneously</p><p end="4738" is_meta="false" speaker="Mark Dubowitz" start="4679">Tom, Tom, Tom.</p><p end="4738" is_meta="false" speaker="Thomas Pickering" start="4679">[unintelligible] of their reactors .

It&#8217;ll be industrial sized . It&#8217;ll be massive, and they &#8217;ll have zero breakout. Tom and Phil, you have not explained to us, when Iran rea ches zero breakout in year 15 -- in fact, President Obama said, in an interview with NPR, that they &#8217;re going to reach near zero breakout by year 13 . You haven&#8217; t explained to the audience, and you haven&#8217; t explained to us how near zero breakout or breakout or undetectable breakout is a good deal for America.</p><p end="4738" is_meta="false" speaker="Mark Dubowitz" start="4679">&#8220; Breakout &#8221; means the length of time it takes to weaponize a bomb &#8217;s worth of uranium.</p><p end="4738" is_meta="false" speaker="Mark Dubowitz" start="4679">It effectively means the most difficult element of developing a nuclear weapon and the element of developing a nuclear weapon that is easiest for us to detect.</p><p end="4801" is_meta="false" speaker="Mark Dubowitz" start="4738">It &#8217;s very difficult for us to detect warhead des ign in a laboratory.</p><p end="4801" is_meta="false" speaker="Mark Dubowitz" start="4738">It &#8217;s complicated stuff, you know --</p><p end="4801" is_meta="true" speaker="Mark Dubowitz" start="4738">talking simultaneously</p><p end="4801" is_meta="false" speaker="Thomas Pickering" start="4738">Just -- just one point.

Getting rid of 14,000 of 20,000 centrifug es is gett ing rid of your infrastructure -- it &#8217;s not getting rid of your infrastructure . It&#8217;s preserving it . Keeping the A rak reactor in a position where it can make kilograms of weapons grade plutonium per year, but taking it out of that particular capa city, that&#8217;s certainly keeping the infrastructure in place .

They &#8217;re not going to get rid of -- they &#8217;re not dismantling . They&#8217;ve made it a point they will not dismantle a single centrifuge . Some of them won&#8217;t be spinning, but they &#8217;re still going to exist.</p><p end="4981" is_meta="false" speaker="Thomas Pickering" start="4922">That &#8217;s why we &#8217;re such successful negotiators.</p><p end="4981" is_meta="true" speaker="Thomas Pickering" start="4922">laughter</p><p end="4981" is_meta="false" speaker="Philip Gordon" start="4922">Well, one reason is that &#8217;s partly what got us here . You know, the world, as Iran started to do enrichment and move toward the potential weapons capability, go back to 2003,</p><p end="4981" is_meta="false" speaker="Philip Gordon" start="4922">de cided that the outcome had to be zero enrichment. And we insisted on that, and we insisted on that as they increased from, at the time, 160 centrifuges . And we said, &#8220; No,</p><p end="4981" is_meta="false" speaker="Philip Gordon" start="4922">it has to be zero. &#8221; Then they got up to 3,000, we said &#8220;It has to be zero. &#8221; And they had 6,000, &#8220;It has to be zero. &#8221; And we &#8217;ve done that all the way to 19,000 .</p><p end="5044" is_meta="false" speaker="Philip Gordon" start="4981">So we could, as you suggest, and as I think Mike and Mark would suggest, keep choking .</p><p end="5044" is_meta="false" speaker="Philip Gordon" start="4981">While we choke -- you know, we could take that gamble . As I said before, we could have showed up at the talks in the first day, said &#8220;The only out come here is zero enrichment, no civilian reactors and fill Fordo w with cement and let us go anywhere,</p><p end="5044" is_meta="false" speaker="Philip Gordon" start="4981">anytime , including your military bases. &#8221; We could have said t hat. I&#8217;m just suggesting that had we done so, choking, choking sanctions, instead of 19,000 centrifuges, we &#8217;d get to 25, and then 30, and then they &#8217;d finish the heavy water reactor at Arak , and then they &#8217;d harden Fordo w -- and then we would have another debate three years from now,</p><p end="5044" is_meta="false" speaker="Philip Gordon" start="4981">and they &#8217;d be at 30,000 centrifuges and all the rest --</p><p end="5044" is_meta="false" speaker="Philip Gordon" start="4981">Be careful --</p><p end="5098" is_meta="false" speaker="Mark Dubowitz" start="5044">Well, the reality is is that I don &#8217;t believe that we should have imposed choking sanctions to these negotiations, that it &#8217;s not -- again, it &#8217;s the fallacy of the false alternative that Phil is very good offering . The fact of the matter is we should increase the sanctions .We continue to ratchet up the pressure . We didn&#8217;t have to sti ck at zero enrichment, but we could have offered exactly what President Obama offered in the beginning, which was 500 to 1,000 centrifuges . Why the willingness on the part of the United States to continue to diminish our nuclear demands step by step? The fact is that the Iranians fear U.S. escalation dominance . They began in 2003 negotiating the Europeans over 13 years . They only increased their operating centrifuges by 9 ,500. That&#8217;s about 700 centrifuges a year . They increased their program increment ally. They fear escalation dominance . They fear our crippling sanctions .</p><p end="5162" is_meta="false" speaker="Mark Dubowitz" start="5098">They fear our military power. And so you &#8217;re right, we could have actually increased our sanctions, but we could have done so in an incremental way . We could have ratcheted up the pressure . And most importantly, we could have stuck to our nuclear demands .</p><p end="5162" is_meta="false" speaker="Mark Dubowitz" start="5098">Why the rush, you ask ? The rush is because President Obama has 18 months left in his term. And President Obama wants a legacy -capping nuclear deal. I said in my introduction, why not let Hillary negotiate this ? Why not let Marco Rubio negotiate this ? Why the rush to negotiate, right ?</p><p end="5162" is_meta="true" speaker="Mark Dubowitz" start="5098">laughter</p><p end="5162" is_meta="false" speaker="Mark Dubowitz" start="5098">Stick to a -- I &#8217;m trying to be bipartisan -- stick --</p><p end="5162" is_meta="true" speaker="Mark Dubowitz" start="5098">laughter</p><p end="5220" is_meta="false" speaker="Michael Doran" start="5162">We haven &#8217;t stuck to a single principle in this negotiation .</p><p end="5278" is_meta="false" speaker="Michael Doran" start="5220">The principle that we enunciat ed with the interim agreement was that they had to verify that it was a peaceful program. For example, the president said, &#8220; Fordow is absolutely inconsistent with a peaceful program. &#8221; He caved on Fordow .</p><p end="5278" is_meta="false" speaker="Philip Gordon" start="5220">He said they don&#8217;t need enrichment at Fordow, and the agreement is very clear, there will be no enrichment at Fordow . There will be no fissile material at Fordow --</p><p end="5278" is_meta="true" speaker="Philip Gordon" start="5220">talking simultaneously</p><p end="5278" is_meta="false" speaker="Michael Doran" start="5220">But there will be enrichment of what ? There will be enrichment of what?</p><p end="5278" is_meta="false" speaker="Philip Gordon" start="5220">And still [inaudible] --</p><p end="5278" is_meta="true" speaker="Philip Gordon" start="5220">talking simultaneously</p><p end="5278" is_meta="true" speaker="Philip Gordon" start="5220">bell sounds</p><p end="5278" is_meta="false" speaker="Mark Dubowitz" start="5220">He was . That&#8217;s my plan t.[laughter]</p><p end="5345" is_meta="false" speaker="Thomas Pickering" start="5278">I want to take you to two stories that I think are important and throw light on this question. Two years ago a few of us met with then the leading Iranian negotiator. He said to us frankly that &#8220; For eight years we have been in the doghouse . Ahmadinejad put us there, and we &#8217;re now coming out . We will come forward with a set of ideas and principles for t he negotiation that will deal effectively with the problem of your suspicion about our nuclear weapon .</p><p end="5399" is_meta="false" speaker="Thomas Pickering" start="5345">And we will accept inspections, a wide variety of them. And we want sanctions relief .</p><p end="5399" is_meta="false" speaker="Thomas Pickering" start="5345">And if we cannot achieve this with you in a reasonable period of time, we won &#8217;t be back. &#8221; And that&#8217;s, in fact, what has happened, interestingly enough . And that&#8217;s where we are now.</p><p end="5399" is_meta="false" speaker="Thomas Pickering" start="5345">A second story: T wo weeks ago I had the opportunity on successive days to hear again from the lead negotiators on both sides. And as Philip mentioned just a moment ago,</p><p end="5399" is_meta="false" speaker="Thomas Pickering" start="5345">each one of them said to us, &#8220; This is a good deal for the following reasons, &#8221; and the Iranian reasons were, guess what, quite friendly to the Iranian point of view and ignored the question of the maj or negotiating concessions they had to make . The Americans were less so but, nevertheless, reflected their view .</p><p end="5463" is_meta="false" speaker="Thomas Pickering" start="5399">But when I sat down just as the Belfer Center sat down, I could not find any reason to believe that what they had said was so inc onsistent that, in fact, we didn&#8217;t have a deal very close to in hand, and that nothing contravened the framework .We now have a new opportunity in the region, but we have a new opportunity first with Iran n ow, to stop any eff ort toward a nuclear weapon . So, I urge you to vote &#8220;Yes &#8221;</p><p end="5463" is_meta="false" speaker="Thomas Pickering" start="5399">when the time comes, to support this arrangement. It is, in my view, the answer to this difficult problem.</p><p end="5463" is_meta="false" speaker="Michael Doran" start="5399">Wishful thinking among highly intelligent and experienced people is a very common thing . Just remember all of the very intelligent investors who put their faith in Bernie Madoff.</p><p end="5518" is_meta="false" speaker="Michael Doran" start="5463">The men sitting over here are intelligent, and they are experienced, and they are engaging in the worst kind of wishful thinking, as is the White House . It calls to mind Ronald Reagan in 1987, when he appeared before the American people and he said,</p><p end="5518" is_meta="false" speaker="Michael Doran" start="5463">&#8220; Three months ago I told you that I didn&#8217;t trade arms for hostages with Iran . Today, my heart and my best intentions still tell me that that is true . Bu t the evidence has shown that actually something else is true . I did trade arms for hostages.&#8221; Now, who traded the arms for hostages ? Who was involved in that deal ? You may recall, for those of you who ar e old enough, that Bud McFarlane , the former National Security Advisor, and Ollie North, of the Iran -Contra scandal, went to Iran with a plane -load of weapons . And they delivered it to the Iranians .</p><p end="5581" is_meta="false" speaker="Michael Doran" start="5518">And in return, the Iranians gave up hostages that were held by Hezbollah in Lebanon.</p><p end="5581" is_meta="false" speaker="Michael Doran" start="5518">What was the thinking behind it ? The thinking behind it was &#8220;We &#8217;re not trading arms for hostages . What we&#8217;re doing is we &#8217;re finding the moderates in Tehran. We&#8217;re making -- we &#8217;re reaching out across the political divide with them, and we &#8217;re going --</p><p end="5581" is_meta="false" speaker="Michael Doran" start="5518">we &#8217;re go ing to create a new relationship .</p><p end="5581" is_meta="false" speaker="Michael Doran" start="5518">Now, Ollie North wakes up and bites off the heads of snakes for breakfast. Bud McFarlan e was a former Marine . Ronald Reagan was a very experienced politician . And he had this fantasy of finding the moderates in Iran and coming to an agreement with them . And he got led down the garden path and made a fool of himself. The exactsame thing is happening now to the -- to the Obama Administration . There &#8217;s a fantasy in the A merican national security elite that across the Persian Gulf, there is this ally in waiting . And if we just embrace it properly, everything is going to get better.</p><p end="5642" is_meta="false" speaker="Philip Gordon" start="5581">So, this has been a good debate . And we &#8217;ve had a bit of fun with it . But the truth is, it &#8217;s a very serious topic . And I have a lot of respect for a lot of the arguments that we &#8217;ve heard . As you sit here and think about how you want to vote, whether you believe this deal is good for America or not , I would ask you to imagine not that you &#8217;re just sitting here and you get a free vote as a citizen, but you&#8217; re the president of the United States.</p><p end="5642" is_meta="false" speaker="Philip Gordon" start="5581">And it&#8217;s June 30th . And your team has come back and said, &#8220; Mr. President, Madame President, it &#8217;s been really hard, but we got the framework that we &#8217;ve talked out. Well,</p><p end="5642" is_meta="false" speaker="Philip Gordon" start="5581">we &#8217;ve got it . Now you just have to decide if it &#8217;s good for America or not.&#8221;</p><p end="5642" is_meta="false" speaker="Philip Gordon" start="5581">Now, maybe Mister, Madame President -- Mike and Mark have persuaded you it&#8217;s not good for America and you should reject it . And if you do, maybe we&#8217;ll put on more sanctions, and somehow the world will follow us, even though we walked away from the agreement .</p><p end="5707" is_meta="false" speaker="Philip Gordon" start="5642">And maybe Iran will then come back to the table and agree to zero or 500 centrifuges .</p><p end="5707" is_meta="false" speaker="Philip Gordon" start="5642">And maybe they &#8217;ll get rid of their heavy water reactor anyway . And maybe they&#8217;ll accept anytime, anywhere inspections, including military bases . And maybe they&#8217;ll recognize Israel and stop terrorism. Maybe all that will happen, speaking of fantasies --</p><p end="5707" is_meta="false" speaker="Philip Gordon" start="5642">because y ou thought this deal wasn&#8217;t good and you rejected it, and you hoped all those things would happen, Mister, Madame President. On the other hand, maybe we &#8217;ll walk away . We won &#8217;t be able to keep the international sanctions coalition together . Iran will sta rt resuming all of those things it stopped doing with the joint plan of action,</p><p end="5707" is_meta="false" speaker="Philip Gordon" start="5642">stockpiling 20 percent uranium, spinning 10,000, 19,000 centrifuges and more, finishing the heavy water reactor at Arak . And at that point, you -- and think about this veryse riously -- will be faced with a choice . Either you acquiesce and let them finish that heavy water reactor and build more centrifuges, or use military force to stop it, which would have all sorts of other consequences in the region.</p><p end="5759" is_meta="false" speaker="Philip Gordon" start="5707">That &#8217;s what I &#8217;d ask you to think about when you decide if this agreement is good for America or not . I would suspect that --</p><p end="5759" is_meta="false" speaker="Philip Gordon" start="5707">-- if we got to that point --</p><p end="5759" is_meta="false" speaker="Philip Gordon" start="5707">-- the deal you walked away from would look very good indeed.</p><p end="5759" is_meta="false" speaker="Mark Dubowitz" start="5707">Phil and Tom, it &#8217;s been a real pleasure . And I want to thank you both for your great service to our country . I -- two years ago, I went to see someone in the White House .</p><p end="5759" is_meta="false" speaker="Mark Dubowitz" start="5707">That &#8217;s when the White House would still see me . And I met a senior White House director there . And at the beginning of the meeting, he said to me, Mark, I want to be very clear before we start this discussion on an Iran deal, that no deal is bett er than a bad deal . And I said to him, &#8220;I understand this . I think President Obama just said that last week. &#8221; And he said, &#8220;Absolutely . I want to reiterate no deal is better than a bad deal. &#8221;</p><p end="5818" is_meta="false" speaker="Mark Dubowitz" start="5759">We spent about an hour and a half debating the em erging Iran deal. And at the end of it, he was showing me out of his office . We were walking down the hall, and he turnedto me, and he said, &#8220;Mark, I just want to be clear . As I said at the beginning of our discussion, that a bad deal is better than no deal. &#8221; Now, that &#8217;s what&#8217;s known in Washington as a gaffe . A Washington ga ffe is when the White House tells you the truth.</p><p end="5818" is_meta="false" speaker="Mark Dubowitz" start="5759">And I think that&#8217;s where we are at today . We are at, today -- and you&#8217;ve heard the argument from Phil. You &#8217;ve heard the argument from Tom. That really a bad deal is better than no deal . But the fact of the matter is that the fallacy of false alternatives ?</p><p end="5818" is_meta="false" speaker="Mark Dubowitz" start="5759">There is an alternative to a bad deal. It&#8217;s not no deal . It&#8217;s a better deal.</p><p end="5818" is_meta="false" speaker="Mark Dubowitz" start="5759">Our side outlined seven specific ways to make this deal better . They are not fictions.</p><p end="5818" is_meta="false" speaker="Mark Dubowitz" start="5759">They are real alternatives . Without go anywhere, go any time inspections into military bases, we &#8217;ll have no way of knowing wheth er the regime is developing warheads.</p><p end="5883" is_meta="false" speaker="Mark Dubowitz" start="5818">Without the ability to actuall y meet the scientists that have been involved in this and see the docum entation and get into the Parchi n site that is currently being blocked and sanitized, we &#8217;ll have no way of creating a baseline for a proper verification and inspection regime . And with out effective, peaceful snapbacks, economic leverage that helps us actually respond to Iranian cheating and challenging . We will only be able to respond using military force . If you believe that economic seduction will change the hard men of this regime, then you should support their side . If you believe that this terror sponsoring, holocaust -denying --</p><p end="5883" is_meta="false" speaker="Mark Dubowitz" start="5818">-- [unintelligible] cheating regime --</p><p end="5940" is_meta="false" speaker="Michael Doran" start="5883">He &#8217;s a --</p><p end="5940" is_meta="true" speaker="Michael Doran" start="5883">l aughter</p><p end="5940" is_meta="false" speaker="Michael Doran" start="5883">He &#8217;s a published author on this topic.</p></transcript></debate>
