There's still fewer African American students at UCLA today than there were prior to 1996, when Proposition 209 was adopted.</p><p end="1141" is_meta="false" speaker="Erwin Chemerinsky" start="1080">Good evening. It's such a pleasure to be with you. Every Supreme Court case to consider the issue has held that affirmative action by college universities is constitutional. The Supreme Court for decades has said that colleges and universities have a co mpelling interest in a diverse student body. The colleges and universities may use race as one fact or among many to enhance diversity and benefit minorities. This has ] had a tremendous beneficial effect. I t's reduced the unfortunate legacy of racial discrimination in this country. It's enhanced the education of countless students.</p><p end="1198" is_meta="false" speaker="Erwin Chemerinsky" start="1141">Tonight Professor Archer and I are arguing we should not abandon this policy that largely has worked so well. I am going to argue why affirmative action is consistent with the Equal Protection Clause. Professor Archer, in her time, will respond to the arguments that are made against affirmative action by Mr. Taylor and Mr. Clegg. I am going to make three points. First, affirmative action is consistent with the text and the history of the Equal Protection Clause. Second, affirmative action serves compelling purposes, especially diversity in college universities. And, third, there's no other way to achieve these goals, especially diversity, except through affirmative action. As to thefirst point, the Constitution says, "No state shall deny any person equal protection of laws." Notice it doesn't say that everyone has to be treated the same.</p><p end="1261" is_meta="false" speaker="Erwin Chemerinsky" start="1198">Long ago, Aristotle said, "Equality means treating likes alike and unalikes unalike." To the extent that students are different, based on their history, based on what they bring to the campus, they must be treated differently. Notice it also doesn't say that the government must be colorblind. The 14th Amendment could've been written that way,</p><p end="1261" is_meta="false" speaker="Erwin Chemerinsky" start="1198">but it wasn't. It is absurd to think of the government as always colorblind. If the police want to infiltrate a gang that's defined by race, surely they should be able to take that into account. Throughout American history, the Supreme Court has recognized that equal protection allows the government to take race into account. That's consistent with the history of the 14th Amendment. The very Congress that ratified the 14th Amendment adopted color -based programs, things we call, "affirmative action," today,</p><p end="1261" is_meta="false" speaker="Erwin Chemerinsky" start="1198">like the Freedmen's Bureau. It's why the Supreme Court repeatedly has said, "Colleges,</p><p end="1261" is_meta="false" speaker="Erwin Chemerinsky" start="1198">universities can engage in affirmative action."</p><p end="1316" is_meta="false" speaker="Erwin Chemerinsky" start="1261">My second point is that affirmative action serves compelling purposes, especially diversity. We cannot discuss affirmative action outside of the context of American history. Throughout American history, there have been separate and unequal schools bas ed on race, and that's not a thing from long ago. Just a couple of decades ago,</p><p end="1316" is_meta="false" speaker="Erwin Chemerinsky" start="1261">Harvard Professor Christopher Jencks found that an average 20 percent less is spent on an African -American child's elementary and secondary school compared to a white child's elementary and secondary school. Today, about 90 percent of the students in private schools are white. The reality is that race matters enormously in how all of us experience society. College universities have long realized diversity matters. It's long been easy to get into Harvard or Yale if you're from Montana or North Dakota compared to if you're Boston or New York based.</p><p end="1381" is_meta="false" speaker="Erwin Chemerinsky" start="1316">College universities have long accepted people who had relatives who went to that college o r university. Legacies, I don't hear Mr. Taylor talking about the problem in mismatch for legacies. The reality is diversity matters , and racial diversity matters. Racial diversity helps to bring cross -racial understanding. It breaks down stereotypes. It prepares students for the multicultural world in which they'll exist. That's why every Supreme Court case has found diversity to be a compelling interest. And my third point is there is no other way to achieve diversity except through affirmative ac tion, no other way to achieve the goals that I've talked about except through this. This has been the experience in states that have tried to eliminate affirmative action. As I mentioned earlier, in California, after Proposition 209, there wasa dramatic decrease in the presence of African -American and Latino students, especially at UCLA Berkeley. There are still fewer African -American students today at UCLA than there were prior to 1996.</p><p end="1442" is_meta="false" speaker="Erwin Chemerinsky" start="1381">There are dramatically fewer African -American and Latino students at Berkeley and UCLA law schools compared to Stanford and USC. But affirmative action programs work. Take the University of Texas program that's now before the Supreme Court. They look at race as one of many factors in admissions. In addition to grades and test scores and two letters of recommendation, race is just one of six factors, and yet doing that,</p><p end="1442" is_meta="false" speaker="Erwin Chemerinsky" start="1381">together with taking the top 10 percent of high schools across the state, meant there was a 20 percent increase in African -American students, a 15 percent increase in Latino students. Professor Archer will respond in detail to Mr. Taylor, but I want to disagree with a couple of things that he says. One thing that he says is they are against large racial preferences. I think all of us would be against large racial preferences, but that's not what you're asked to vote on tonight. In order to vote for the affirmative, you have to vote against all racial preferences, large or small, that's how the topic is written.</p><p end="1497" is_meta="false" speaker="Erwin Chemerinsky" start="1442">He spent most of his time talking about his mismatch hypothesis. There's one problem with the mismatch theory. It's flat out wrong. The evidence doesn't support it. In fact,</p><p end="1497" is_meta="false" speaker="Erwin Chemerinsky" start="1442">I'll quote to you from a brief that was recently filed in the Supreme Court by Richard Lempert a social scientist and professor at Michigan. He said, "The overwhelming weight of the evidence suggests that affirmative action as currently practiced, does not harm minorities for academic mismatch, and may benefit students." If there's any mismatch problem it is that minorities are more likely to be in situations of under-</p><p end="1497" is_meta="false" speaker="Erwin Chemerinsky" start="1442">match. To vote for the affirmative tonight you must find o ne of two things. Either they must convince you that diversity is unimportant, disagreeing with the Supreme Court and almost every university in the country, or they must convince you that there is some other way to achieve diversity besides what we're di scussing. No college or university has found it yet.</p><p end="1554" is_meta="false" speaker="Erwin Chemerinsky" start="1497">Focusing on class doesn't do that because , although more percentage wise African American and Latinos are coming from disadvantages classes , the sheer number of white students who are disadvantaged greater. Focusing on class doesn't yield racial diversity. Nothing does. That's why you should continue the status quo and vote against the proposition.</p><p end="1622" is_meta="false" speaker="Roger Clegg" start="1554">Thank you very much a nd thank you to Intelligence Squared for putting on this event.</p><p end="1622" is_meta="false" speaker="Roger Clegg" start="1554">Let's begin by reading the Equal Protection Clause of the 14th Amendment. "No state shall deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws." Note that it doesn't say anything about protecting some races differently from other races. It applies to all races. And, of course, any other interpretation would be inconsistent with equal protection of the laws, wouldn't it? It is also inconsistent with the necessary str ucture of a Constitution for &#8220;We the People,&#8221; the people that is increasingly multi -</p><p end="1622" is_meta="false" speaker="Roger Clegg" start="1554">racial and multi- ethnic. Now Erwin talked about how some kinds of discrimination are certainly okay. Colleges discriminate all the time on the basis of things like SAT sc ores and grades and so forth.</p><p end="1692" is_meta="false" speaker="Roger Clegg" start="1622">But some kinds of discrimination are not okay under the Equal Protection Clause when you look at its historical context A nd the principle kind of discrimination that is not okay under the Equal Protection Clause is discrimination on the basis of race. It's true that the people who drafted the Equal Protection Clause had in the forefront of their minds protecting the rights of African Americans who had just been freed from slavery, but they deliberately chose words that were broader in protection than that. Words that protected whites, as well as blacks, from racial discrimination. And it would today protect Asian Americans from being treated less favorably because of their race than white Hispanics. And it's good that they did. It is after all the Constitution we are expounding, and it would be untenable to have a legal regime in 2015 that allowed the government to sort p eople according to skin color and what country their ancestors came from in our increasingly multi- ethnic and multi-racial society.</p><p end="1742" is_meta="false" speaker="Roger Clegg" start="1692">Bear in mind that our opponents interpret the Equal Protection Clause to permit racial discrimination against a racial minority, Asian Americans, in favor of white Hispanics.</p><p end="1742" is_meta="false" speaker="Roger Clegg" start="1692">Now, it's sometimes said that the Constitution means what the Supreme Court says itmeans, and I don't buy that completely. But it's worth pointing out here that the basic approach the court has taken is the correct one, that all Americans are protected from racial discrimination and that exceptions to this rule will be allowed only in extraordinary circumstances when the government has a really, really, really, really good reason to discrimi nate, and no other way to accomplish this compelling end except through racial discrimination.</p><p end="1804" is_meta="false" speaker="Roger Clegg" start="1742">If our opponents don't establish all four of those reallys, then they lose. It's as simple as that. So, do we have that in the case of racial preferences in state university admissions? We do not . And this is where the Supreme Court has gotten wrong --</p><p end="1804" is_meta="false" speaker="Roger Clegg" start="1742">where I hope it will correct itself in the year ahead. What the C ourt has said and what our opponents are arguing tonight is that what some students say in random conversations in and outside campus classrooms might be so insightful , and so unlikely and difficult to be learned in any other way besides these random conversations , that it is worth denying admission to some white and Asian American students because of their race so that other white and Asian American students might hear these random observations . That's it .</p><p end="1859" is_meta="false" speaker="Roger Clegg" start="1804">That is what universities are arguing . I don't think that that is compelling at all . But there's something else that you need to keep in mind tonight. Even if you think that there is something to that argument , you have to weigh against that purported benefit the costs of racial discrimination . Now, my partner -- Stuart Taylor tonight, has already described one of the heaviest of those heaviest costs, namely the mismatch of students in universities . But there are a lot of other costs too . And in my remaining time, I'm going to run through them . Here they are. It's personally unfair, passes over better-</p><p end="1859" is_meta="false" speaker="Roger Clegg" start="1804">qualif ied students, and sets a disturbing legal, political, and moral precedent in allowing racial discrimination . It creates resentment .</p><p end="1923" is_meta="false" speaker="Roger Clegg" start="1859">It stigmatizes the so -called beneficiaries in the eyes of their classmates, teachers, and themselves as well as future employers, clients, and patients . It fosters a victim mindset, removes the incentive for academic excellence . It encourages separatism. It compromises the academic mission of the university and lowers the overall academic quality of the studen t body. It creates pressure to discriminate in grading and graduation . It breeds hypocrisy within the school . It encourages a scofflaw attitude among college officials . It papers over the real social problem of why so many African Americans and Latinos are academically uncompetitive . As Stuart said, they typically emerge from K through 12 schools four years behind their white and Asian peersacademically . That's a problem that should be addressed, but we are not -- there's not the urg ency to address it because of the existence of racial preferences .</p><p end="1981" is_meta="false" speaker="Roger Clegg" start="1923">Another cost -- perhaps most fundamental of all -- it gets states, state governments, and their schools involved in unsavory activities like deciding which racial and ethnic minorities will be favored and which ones not -- and how much blood is required to establish group membership? An untenable legal regime in America that is becoming increasingly multiracial and multiethnic . And where individual Americans are more and more likely themselves to be multiracial and multiethnic, starting with our president . I think that it is very hard to say that all of those costs are outweighed by anything that might be learned in a random campus conversation . Please vote against a pro-</p><p end="1981" is_meta="false" speaker="Roger Clegg" start="1923">pref erence interpretation of the Constitution and in favor of the motion tonight. Thank you.</p><p end="2043" is_meta="false" speaker="Deborah Archer" start="1981">Good evening, everyone. My partner has explained the legal analysis that firmly establishes the constitutionality of affirmative action programs . Although there is a push to interpret the Equal Protection Clause in a way that ignores race and racial context, the very purpose of the 14th Amendment is to counter the oppression of historically subjugated racial minorities . You've also heard a laundry list of the alleged harm that affirmative action causes to black and Latino students . Those harms are not real. Affirmat ive action has offered a pathway to opportunity for generations of students of color . It has taken steps to diversify our campuses and has made for a more just America.</p><p end="2100" is_meta="false" speaker="Deborah Archer" start="2043">The weight of the evidence demonstrates that affirmative action is good p olicy. But whatever y ou think of affirmative action as a matter of policy, that's not the question you're asked to address today. The question is whether or not affirmative action violates the Equal Protection Clause, and I urge you to vote against that motion. It bears repeating that the United States Supreme Court has repeatedly held that race -conscious admissions programs in public colleges and universities are constitutional with substantial, not trivial, substantial benefits that flow to the educati onal institution, the larger society, and individual students, both students of color and white students. Pursuing the educational value of a racially diverse student body is a compelling state interest. Arguing -- arguments about whether extra points se t aside substantial preferences, whether or not those are constitutional are all -- they're all red herrings.</p><p end="2164" is_meta="false" speaker="Deborah Archer" start="2100">The court has already held that universities cannot have specific racial targets,</p><p end="2164" is_meta="false" speaker="Deborah Archer" start="2100">universities cannot set aside spots for students of certain racial backgrounds, and universities can't consider race in an inflexible manner. The Equal Protection Clause does allow universities to use race as one consideration when choosing among a group of qualified students, not all with identical qualifications, but all qualified. Numbers are not the only thing that matter, and higher SAT scores does not make you more qualified or more deserving of admission.</p><p end="2164" is_meta="true" speaker="Deborah Archer" start="2100">applause</p><p end="2164" is_meta="false" speaker="Deborah Archer" start="2100">Universities are trying to admit people, not SAT scores. And universities don't exist to credential the best test takers. I'm not saying that race is a qualification, not at all, but race is a part of who we are. The Equal Protection Clause permits colleges and universities to consider many characteristics, including sexual orientat ion, political persuasion, gender, whether or not you're from Ohio.</p><p end="2221" is_meta="false" speaker="Deborah Archer" start="2164">We can't exclude race and only race from that list of considerations. We couldn't possibly offer each student individualized holistic review without giving some consideration to race, especially when an applicant has indicated that race is important to their own sense of self identity, their own sense of who they are. For that student who says their race is important, it's critical to understanding their achievements, their a ccomplishments, and their perspectives. Now, the statistics that have been cited by the proponents of this resolution about disparities and outcomes for students of color are indeed troubling. But every assertion that they make is contested, and none can be the basis of a constitutional rule. The methods and conclusions they've reached have been criticized and rejected by almost every social scientist who has examined thedata. There have been many studies that have found no evidence, whatsoever, of mis match.</p><p end="2272" is_meta="false" speaker="Deborah Archer" start="2221">There are numerous studies that say affirmative action programs have unequivocally benefitted minority students and society. There are studies that say minority students fair far better, the higher ranked school that they attend, and, very importantly, there are studies that say the problem of under matching, where students with strong academic credentials attend lower ranked schools even though they could get accepted to higher ranked schools, is far more a problem for minority students than mismatches. Even if you were to accept t he proponents' assertions as true, they do not undermine the conclusion that achieving racial diversity is a compelling government interest. Those statistics they cite are just a snapshot of a much larger story. They ignore the fact that race continues to structure the opportunities and outlook for all Americans.</p><p end="2340" is_meta="false" speaker="Deborah Archer" start="2272">To assess the impact of race conscious admissions programs, we must first acknowledge the critical factors that contribute to any alleged black or Latino under performance in the cla ssroom. And those include racial discrimination. They include discrimination by professors. They include inadequate K -12 education systems. They include stereotype threat. The gap between the performance of some minority students and some white students is quite troubling, but race conscious admissions programs are not the cause of those troubles. Finally, the argument that race conscious admissions programs should be outlawed because minority students end up attending schools that are academically to o challenging for them quite frankly is condescending. It inappropriately seeks to displace the independent, informed judgment of minority students about the potential costs and benefits of attending flagship universities and colleges. We should want all of our students to aim high and challenge our -- themselves. We shouldn't be settling for less for minority students.</p><p end="2340" is_meta="true" speaker="Deborah Archer" start="2272">applause</p><p end="2340" is_meta="false" speaker="Deborah Archer" start="2272">The individual harm -- the individual harms that affirmative action's opponents claim will befall minority students have not come to pass.</p><p end="2403" is_meta="false" speaker="Deborah Archer" start="2340">For example, you heard about minority students who will experience stigma, both internal and external, doubting their own qualifications and sense of belonging and hav ing their classmates, and their faculty members doubt thei r abilities. There is no causal connection between race conscious admissions programs and racial stigma. It'snever been established. The fact remains the root causes of racial stigma reach back much further than race conscious admissions programs. We all know that minority students face d stigma before affirmative action programs and they would continue to face stigma without affirmative action programs. In fact, those who argue that race conscious admissions programs should be banned because they stig matize minority students are part of the problem. Stamping all minority students with badges of inferiority by assuming they lack qualifications is racial discrimination. The fact that there were will be racists who assume that every black person or Lati no person that he or she sees is unqualified cannot dictate the reach or meaning of the Constitution.</p><p end="2460" is_meta="true" speaker="Deborah Archer" start="2403">applause</p><p end="2460" is_meta="false" speaker="Deborah Archer" start="2403">The motion asks you to assess the constitutionality of race conscious admissions programs, not whether affirmative action is good policy. But on either question, the proponents of this motion are wrong, and I urge you to vote against the motion.</p><p end="2460" is_meta="true" speaker="Deborah Archer" start="2403">applause</p><p end="2576" is_meta="false" speaker="Roger Clegg" start="2506">Well, you know, the -- it's a Constitution -- there is limited space. You don't have to use every synonym in the -- in the dictionary when you describe what can't be done.</p><p end="2635" is_meta="false" speaker="Roger Clegg" start="2576">What it says is that you can't deny equal protection of the laws. It doesn't say that you have to be colorblind, but in context, what it's saying is that you can't deny equal protection to people because of their skin color. That's basically the same thing as saying that you have to be colorblind unless you have a really, really good reason. I mean, I really don't see any dis tinction between a -- you know, a writing that says, "You have to be colorblind," and saying that, "No American can be denied the equal protection of the laws," given the historical context.</p><p end="2635" is_meta="false" speaker="Erwin Chemerinsky" start="2576">Imagine that a college or university has been proven to discriminate based on race. Can a court order that -- it remedy that and then admit students who have previously been excluded based on race? Of course it can. In other words, it's not totally &#8211;</p><p end="2635" is_meta="false" speaker="Erwin Chemerinsky" start="2576">-- in other words, it's not colorblind. No Supreme Court case in history has ever equated equal protection with colorblindness .</p><p end="2690" is_meta="false" speaker="Erwin Chemerinsky" start="2635">That's because that's not what "equal" means. "Equal" means you treat people who are alike, alike and those who are different, different. People are different based on race,</p><p end="2690" is_meta="false" speaker="Erwin Chemerinsky" start="2635">based on the experiences they've had in society . That's why racial diversity matters so much in colleges and universities.</p><p end="2690" is_meta="false" speaker="Roger Clegg" start="2635">You know, this business that --</p><p end="2690" is_meta="false" speaker="Roger Clegg" start="2635">-- people are different because of their race sounds like something I would've heard maybe a hundred years ago in favor of Jim Crow.</p><p end="2690" is_meta="true" speaker="Roger Clegg" start="2635">applause</p><p end="2690" is_meta="false" speaker="Deborah Archer" start="2635">I don't think that we're saying that people are different because of their race or that people think one way or another that a black or Latino student is going to hold a certain position because they are black or Latino, but I think what we are saying in the context of affirmative action programs is that race influences the way we view the world. It influences how we perceive the things that go on day to day.</p><p end="2760" is_meta="false" speaker="Deborah Archer" start="2690">So although we wouldn't expect a black or Latino student to hold a certain position, we would anticipate that a black or Latino student&#8217;s race would have influenced whatever position it is that they're holding. So we're not making assumptions about &#8211;</p><p end="2760" is_meta="false" speaker="Deborah Archer" start="2690">-- people based on race. We are looking at reality and knowing that race impacts how we think and how we perceive the world, because it's impossible that it -- for it not to.</p><p end="2760" is_meta="false" speaker="Deborah Archer" start="2690">John Donvan:Stuart Taylor.</p><p end="2823" is_meta="false" speaker="Roger Clegg" start="2760">And I think it's fine for --</p><p end="2823" is_meta="false" speaker="Roger Clegg" start="2760">I think it's fine for school s to try to bring in students who have a diversity of backgrounds and perspectives. The problem is when you use skin color or what country your ance stors came from as a proxy for those backgrounds and experiences. You can't look at somebody and say , &#8220;Oh, you're black. You must have this background and this perspective. &#8221; You've got to look at the individual.</p><p end="2823" is_meta="false" speaker="Deborah Archer" start="2760">That's actually ignoring exactly what I said. It's not that someone is saying, &#8220;You're black , you hold this perspective. &#8221; We're saying that , &#8220;You&#8217;re black. I'm sure that the fact that you are black in an America where race very much matters where we're still fighting a nd battling against racial discrimination impacts the way that you see the world, whatever that perspective is, it's important to bring that to the table, &#8221; and you get at that by looking at the whole student. No one's looking at just the race box. We're actually looking at the entire application and getting a sense of who that student is as a person and making sure that classrooms offer diverse perspectives.</p><p end="2881" is_meta="false" speaker="Deborah Archer" start="2823">In fact, it would be wonderful to have blacks and Latino students who are both libera l and both -- who are conservative, who are Republicans, and who areDemocrats. They're not asking for a black person who holds a particular view, but looking to see and assess the whole person knowing that race will impact and influence their views.</p><p end="2881" is_meta="true" speaker="Deborah Archer" start="2823">a pplause</p><p end="2881" is_meta="false" speaker="Erwin Chemerinsky" start="2823">I've been a law professor now for 36 years. I've taught subjects like criminal procedure and Constitutional law in classes that are almost all white and in classes with a substantial number of minority students. When you talk about things like racial profiling of the police , the discussion is vastly different with a significant number of students of color who've experienced it compared to an all- white class. When you talk about affirmative action the conversation is different. That's why diversity matters, because it benefits all students and the education of all studies and prepares students for the multi -cultural society we live.</p><p end="2939" is_meta="false" speaker="Erwin Chemerinsky" start="2881">It's not that a particular student comes with a specific viewpoint, but it does mean that race matters in how we experience the world, how we're treated, and we need to have all those experiences in the classroom.</p><p end="3068" is_meta="false" speaker="Deborah Archer" start="3002">So I think we have to first start by distinguishing affirmative action from negative action.</p><p end="3068" is_meta="false" speaker="Deborah Archer" start="3002">And negative action is where a university will take steps to artificially keep low the numbers of a certain group. And so, it seems like there are allegations -- that universities are engaged in negative action against Asian and Asian American students .</p><p end="3068" is_meta="false" speaker="Deborah Archer" start="3002">If that's true, then we absolutely shoul d do something about that. Universities should explain what they're doing . But we shouldn't confuse negative action with affirmative action .</p><p end="3068" is_meta="true" speaker="Deborah Archer" start="3002">applause</p><p end="3068" is_meta="false" speaker="Deborah Archer" start="3002">That's right.</p><p end="3121" is_meta="false" speaker="Deborah Archer" start="3068">No .

Certainly, numbers -- SAT scores, LSAT scores, are good indication to judge a wide range of students that can be s uccessful at your university . But it shouldn't be the end.

Whenever you allow a university to engage in a holistic review of that student, the student's going to benefit.</p><p end="3121" is_meta="false" speaker="Deborah Archer" start="3068">And for Asian and Asian American communities in particular, it's important . Not all Asian and Asian American stu dents have access to a high quality education. They aren't all as successful educationally . In particular, Cambodian students, Laotian students do not fare as well academically as Korean students or Japanese students, or Chinese students .</p><p end="3182" is_meta="false" speaker="Deborah Archer" start="3121">Laotian and Cambodian students have lower graduation rates than black students . And so, to say that &#8220;Asian&#8221; students don't benefit from affirmative action is just simply --</p><p end="3182" is_meta="false" speaker="Deborah Archer" start="3121">-- wrong . And it's a wedge issue.</p><p end="3182" is_meta="false" speaker="Deborah Archer" start="3121">It's to put a wedge -- put a wedge between the people of color.</p><p end="3182" is_meta="false" speaker="Roger Clegg" start="3121">Let me interrupt you--</p><p end="3182" is_meta="false" speaker="Roger Clegg" start="3121">right there .

College s and universities always look to a wide range of factors, in terms of w hat the student can add to the student body and the diversity of the school. I mentioned, "geography." I mentioned, "legacies." I taught for a long time at U.S.C., I'dventure to say the football players there had lower grades and test scores than other students, or I taught at Duke, the basketball players probably had lower grades and test scores. That's because they brought some other talent to the forefront. There are a much larger pool of students who are qualified to do the work than the number who will be accepted. And so in deciding among them, many factors go into consideration. It is not discrimination to say that one of the things that's considered in addition to athletic talent or legacy is also, "What does a student add based on his or her race to the diversity of the school?" It's wr ong to equate preference with discrimination.</p><p end="3360" is_meta="true" speaker="Erwin Chemerinsky" start="3303">applause</p><p end="3360" is_meta="false" speaker="Deborah Archer" start="3303">Yes, because --</p><p end="3360" is_meta="false" speaker="Deborah Archer" start="3303">-- they're Asians, absolutely.</p><p end="3360" is_meta="false" speaker="Roger Clegg" start="3303">And a quick point on test scores and grades, Erwin I think said all of us would be against large racial preferences. Well, I think we just won the debate. If all you have to establish is that the racial preferences are large, that's undisputed.</p><p end="3416" is_meta="false" speaker="Roger Clegg" start="3360">There are 300 to 400 SAT point average differences in a lot of the colleg es. There are corresponding GPA differences. There are huge achievement differences within the college. And that's pretty large.</p><p end="3416" is_meta="false" speaker="Deborah Archer" start="3360">I think &#8211;</p><p end="3416" is_meta="true" speaker="Deborah Archer" start="3360">applause</p><p end="3416" is_meta="false" speaker="Erwin Chemerinsky" start="3360">No, but we're not debating -- we're not arguing here about, "What 's the best form of affirmative action." The resolution you're asked to vote on is, "Does equal protection forbid racial preferences?" In order to vote affirmative, you have to conclude that all racial preferences, however small, are unconstitutional. No court cases ever said that.</p><p end="3416" is_meta="false" speaker="Deborah Archer" start="3360">I also want to just make a quick point. You said that, that there are large racial preferences is undisputed. That's not true. There are many people -- many prominent social scientists who dispute everything that you've said before. Erwin mentioned Richard Lempert , Ian Ayres, Richard Brooks, Derek Bok They've all disputed the points that you're making.</p><p end="3486" is_meta="false" speaker="Deborah Archer" start="3416">And I think we need to take a step back because everyone else is using the term,</p><p end="3486" is_meta="false" speaker="Deborah Archer" start="3416">"preference," I'm not, because I don't think it's a preference. What universities are doing -- hundreds of universities around the country -- what they're doing is looking at the whole application. It's not a preference. If it was a preference, we'd have far more than 20 percent black and Latino students at most colleges and universities.</p><p end="3486" is_meta="true" speaker="Deborah Archer" start="3416">applause</p><p end="3486" is_meta="false" speaker="Deborah Archer" start="3416">I also want to dispute the use of the word, "discrimination." Erwin mentioned this. There is no symmetry between race conscious measures that seek to include traditionally excluded groups and invidious discrimination that seeks to include people because of a sense of superiority or hatred.</p><p end="3486" is_meta="false" speaker="Deborah Archer" start="3416">John Donvan:All right.</p><p end="3486" is_meta="false" speaker="Deborah Archer" start="3416">Those are not the same thing.</p><p end="3486" is_meta="true" speaker="Deborah Archer" start="3416">applause</p><p end="3486" is_meta="false" speaker="Roger Clegg" start="3416">I don't think that you can draw a meaningful distinction between floors and ceilings that way. I mean, if you are setting ceilings for some -- or if you're having a floor for some,</p><p end="3486" is_meta="false" speaker="Roger Clegg" start="3416">you're setting a ceiling for others. And there's no question that what's going on here is not -- just is an effort, yes, to increase the number of students who are of particular races and ethnicities.</p><p end="3535" is_meta="false" speaker="Roger Clegg" start="3486">But the means for doing that is by discriminating against people of other races and ethnicities because there's too many of them. If you have underrepresented groups,</p><p end="3535" is_meta="false" speaker="Roger Clegg" start="3486">then you must have overrepresented groups. That's just logic.</p><p end="3730" is_meta="false" speaker="Erwin Chemerinsky" start="3657">Okay.</p><p end="3730" is_meta="false" speaker="Erwin Chemerinsky" start="3657">Sure. I actually think he raised two questions, first, about the --</p><p end="3730" is_meta="false" speaker="Erwin Chemerinsky" start="3657">-- the first is the relationship &#8211;</p><p end="3730" is_meta="false" speaker="Roger Clegg" start="3657">If you gave him a couple more minutes, he'd have gotten to 10.</p><p end="3730" is_meta="true" speaker="Roger Clegg" start="3657">laughter</p><p end="3730" is_meta="false" speaker="Erwin Chemerinsky" start="3657">-- the first is the relationship between the Constitution and policy. This is important. The Constitution does not prohibit all use of race. It doesn't prohibit all use of sex. It says that the government can discriminate even on the basis of race if it's ne cessary to achieve a compelling purpose. What we're arguing is, "What's the compelling purpose and is it necessary?" So you can't completely separate the policy and the Constitution. And, second, in terms of diversity, what study after study has found i s that interracial association does break down stereotypes, that interracial association in college and law school and medical school better prepares those who are graduating to deal with a multicultural workforce.</p><p end="3785" is_meta="false" speaker="Erwin Chemerinsky" start="3730">And commonsense bears that. If we deal with those who are different from us, we're then better prepared to deal with those like them in the future.</p><p end="3785" is_meta="false" speaker="Deborah Archer" start="3730">Just -- can I add something?</p><p end="3785" is_meta="false" speaker="Roger Clegg" start="3730">Well, this is astonishing to me that I actually agree with Erwin on something, and it was actually a point that &#8211;</p><p end="3785" is_meta="false" speaker="Erwin Chemerinsky" start="3730">We can stop here.</p><p end="3785" is_meta="true" speaker="Erwin Chemerinsky" start="3730">laughter</p><p end="3785" is_meta="false" speaker="Roger Clegg" start="3730">-- and not only that, but it's something that will make John I think feel better, too, and that is a way to sort of explain why this constitutional argument immediately becomes so laden with policy considerations.</p><p end="3785" is_meta="false" speaker="Roger Clegg" start="3730">Sure.</p><p end="3785" is_meta="false" speaker="Roger Clegg" start="3730">And that is because what the Equal Protection Clause means , and what the Supreme Court, believe it or not, has said that it means, it's got this right, is that racial d iscrimination is forbidden by the 14th Amendment unless, as I said, the government has a really, really, really, really good reason.</p><p end="3844" is_meta="false" speaker="Roger Clegg" start="3785">And so that's why what we're talking about tonight immediately becomes, "Well, okay,</p><p end="3844" is_meta="false" speaker="Roger Clegg" start="3785">is there a really, really , really good reason for the discrimination that state universitiesare engaging in?" That's why, you know, this debate about the Constitution has become so much a policy debate. And that --</p><p end="3844" is_meta="false" speaker="Roger Clegg" start="3785">It is -- that's right. And I think that in order to answer that, we talk, first of all, about whether there is anything good that comes from these random interracial conversations, which is what the diversity argument bo ils down to. And I think that those -- that premise is weak. I think it's even weaker when you consider that a lot of these lessons could be achieved through means that don't involve racial discrimination.</p><p end="3900" is_meta="false" speaker="Roger Clegg" start="3844">You know, you don't have to have -- rely on these -- the happenstance of these conversations in order to teach students that not all black people think the same way. If you're in law school, you can assign th e opinions of Justice Clarence Thomas and the opinions of Justice Thurgood Marshal l and figure it out that way, but even after you've done that if you think that there is still something --</p><p end="3900" is_meta="false" speaker="Roger Clegg" start="3844">-- to the -- there are these possible benefits, you then have to weigh against all of these costs.</p><p end="3900" is_meta="false" speaker="Deborah Archer" start="3844">I actually just don't even know where to begin.</p><p end="3900" is_meta="true" speaker="Deborah Archer" start="3844">laughter</p><p end="3900" is_meta="false" speaker="Deborah Archer" start="3844">Let's start with the lessons can be achieved in other ways. One of the lessons or benefits of affirmative action programs is that they equip us with the skills that we are going to need to engage in an increasingly global economy.</p><p end="3964" is_meta="false" speaker="Deborah Archer" start="3900">That's happening for the first time for many students in college and it's an important skill to learn. You can look at the protests that are going on, on university campuses around the country and see that having real , substantive discussions about race are difficul t. It's the first time that many people are having those conversations because we are incredibly segregated in K through 12 education and we are getting more segregated and the Supreme Court has tied our hands there. We are segregated in our communities and our housing. We -- the Supreme Court just recently recognized last term that it's growing with racial isolation in our communities. Where we can start to bring people together to have these important discussions to gain these skills of cross -</p><p end="3964" is_meta="false" speaker="Deborah Archer" start="3900">racial c onversations is in colleges and universities.</p><p end="4023" is_meta="false" speaker="Roger Clegg" start="3964">And more that would graduate.</p><p end="4023" is_meta="false" speaker="Erwin Chemerinsky" start="3964">I can present you the statistics. It's just not true that 95 percent of college s and universities would have the same diversity. It's just the opposite.</p><p end="4076" is_meta="false" speaker="Deborah Archer" start="4023">Can I just very quickly ? Sorry.</p><p end="4143" is_meta="false" speaker="Deborah Archer" start="4076">Can I very quickly just address --</p><p end="4143" is_meta="false" speaker="Deborah Archer" start="4076">-- a point that Stuart made. They've been discussing back and forth the harm this gives to Asian students and they mentioned UC Berkeley and UCLA. Actually, when race conscious admissions programs were banned in California, Asian students experienced a drop in UCLA and UC Berkeley and just a fluctuation of one percent back and forth over the years and it has been white students who have benefited. So I just want to make that point, because you're -- you keep saying that &#8211;</p><p end="4143" is_meta="false" speaker="Roger Clegg" start="4076">I think that's wrong.</p><p end="4143" is_meta="false" speaker="Deborah Archer" start="4076">-- the race conscious -- I don't think it's wrong.</p><p end="4143" is_meta="false" speaker="Deborah Archer" start="4076">Second, you&#8217;ve been talking about the harm then you said that you don't need studies. There's one point tha t you made earlier on that is particularly difficult for me to swallow, and that is that somehow race conscious admissions programs lower the academic standards and the drive for high achievement for students of color. I don't think there's evidence that there are students of color sitting around saying &#8220; I don't need to work hard because affirmative action is going to get me into college, &#8221; but there is evidence of students of color &#8211;</p><p end="4143" is_meta="false" speaker="Roger Clegg" start="4076">John McWhorter</p><p end="4143" is_meta="false" speaker="Deborah Archer" start="4076">-- fighting &#8211;</p><p end="4143" is_meta="true" speaker="Deborah Archer" start="4076">applause</p><p end="4143" is_meta="false" speaker="Deborah Archer" start="4076">-- fighting for a quality education.</p><p end="4202" is_meta="false" speaker="Deborah Archer" start="4143">There is evidence of students of color trying to get equal access to resources. There is evidence of parents of students of color doing everything humanly possible to get their children a quality education.</p><p end="4202" is_meta="false" speaker="Deborah Archer" start="4143">John Donvan:I want to move on to another question, please. Ma'am, right in the center there. The mic is coming from you right hand side.</p><p end="4202" is_meta="true" speaker="Deborah Archer" start="4143">applause</p><p end="4498" is_meta="false" speaker="Erwin Chemerinsky" start="4440">That's just wrong.</p><p end="4498" is_meta="true" speaker="Erwin Chemerinsky" start="4440">laughter</p><p end="4498" is_meta="false" speaker="Erwin Chemerinsky" start="4440">I've been on admissions committees at three different law schools. We certainly do look to students who are the first in their family to go to college, as I was. Now, let me answer your question directly. There have been many attempts to try to create race neutral ways of achieving diversity.</p><p end="4567" is_meta="false" speaker="Erwin Chemerinsky" start="4498">The University of Texas showed that everything else that it tried failed, which is why the United States Court of Appeals for the Fif th Circuit, with a conservative Judge Patrick Higginbotham writing that Texas is proving no alternative. We'll take UCLA as anexample. They've tried all sorts of alternatives, and they still have fewer African -</p><p end="4567" is_meta="false" speaker="Erwin Chemerinsky" start="4498">Americans today than before in 1996. The reason just looking at just socioeconomic status doesn't work is as I said briefly earlier, the percentage of African -Americans and Latinos that are disadvantaged is higher than the percentage of whites, but the sheer number of whites who are disadvantaged is greater. So focus on that socioeconomics,</p><p end="4567" is_meta="false" speaker="Erwin Chemerinsky" start="4498">which is important, won't yield racial diversity.</p><p end="4567" is_meta="false" speaker="Roger Clegg" start="4498">Well, certainly, you know, if what you're trying to do is meet a racial quota, there is no better way to meet that racial quota than by considering race.</p><p end="4567" is_meta="false" speaker="Roger Clegg" start="4498">No, I am serious.</p><p end="4616" is_meta="false" speaker="Roger Clegg" start="4567">Yeah. Well, I think that if schools are saying that, "Well, in order to hit our racial numbers, we really have to take race into account," you know, I think that's plausible. But, first of all, I think that Erwin is wrong in saying that the University of Texas has not been extremely successful in using the top 10 perce nt plan. There is actually, you know, more diversity under the top 10 percent plan than there had been when the University of Texas was using quotas. Now they want to re -impose racial preferences on top of the top 10 percent plan because -- and they want to insure that the African -Americans who are admitted come from well- to-do families rather than those poor African -American students who are being admitted under the top 10 percent plan . That's part of the issue that's before the Supreme Court.</p><p end="4673" is_meta="false" speaker="Deborah Archer" start="4616">Just a quick point about top 10 percent plans generally and the one in Texas. They work because there is racial segregation in our communities in our public schools. You're able to get diversity through top 10 percent plans because black people in Texas have --</p><p end="4673" is_meta="false" speaker="Deborah Archer" start="4616">attend predominantly black schools, and white people in Texas attend predominantly white schools. And so the top 10 percent of any class is going to demonstrate that kind of racial isolation. There's something really perverse about telling a university that in order to achi eve the benefits of a racially diverse class , you have to rely on racial segregation in K -12 education.</p><p end="4746" is_meta="false" speaker="Deborah Archer" start="4673">Also Texas -- the top 10 percent plan -- and other top 10 percent plans , don't allow you to achieve the full diversity. They're asking us not to rely just on race, but that's what those plans do. They're saying, "You got enough black people by going &#8211; by getting the top 10 percent plan, and that's enough." What Texas wants to do is take it a step further and say, "We want a lot of div ersity. We don't just want black or Latino students who attended racially segregated schools. We want a variety of black and Latino students." And I think that that's a -- that, that means that, that race neutral alternative is no t a workable race neutral alternative or even race neutral.</p><p end="4746" is_meta="false" speaker="Roger Clegg" start="4673">I don't think there's anything perverse about the Texas 10 percent plan. They not only get racial diversity, th ey get class diversity. Getting class diversity is good. And so now the idea is that they need overt racial preferences so they can get some wealthy black kids in there because they've got plenty of relatively poor black kids and Hispanic kids.</p><p end="4746" is_meta="false" speaker="Deborah Archer" start="4673">But that's a bad thing.</p><p end="4746" is_meta="false" speaker="Roger Clegg" start="4673">That begins to sound a little strange &#8211;</p><p end="4746" is_meta="false" speaker="Roger Clegg" start="4673">Deborah Archer:You don't want to have all of your class &#8211;</p><p end="4746" is_meta="false" speaker="Roger Clegg" start="4673">-- but &#8211;</p><p end="4746" is_meta="false" speaker="Deborah Archer" start="4673">-- diversity be the same as your racial diversity so that all you have are poor black students and all you have are poor Latino students. That only reinforces stereotypes. It doesn't help to break down stereotypes.</p><p end="4797" is_meta="true" speaker="Deborah Archer" start="4746">applause</p><p end="4926" is_meta="false" speaker="Erwin Chemerinsky" start="4870">What you say is right. Many studies have demonstrated that there is a cultural and racial bias to standardized tests. It's why you can't measure qualifications just based on standardized tests. And in terms of &#8211;</p><p end="4926" is_meta="true" speaker="Erwin Chemerinsky" start="4870">applause</p><p end="4926" is_meta="false" speaker="Erwin Chemerinsky" start="4870">-- again, having looked at the studies about the LSAT, there is only a very weak correlation between the LSAT in first -year law school grades, no correlation to LSAT in second and third -year grades, and no proven correlation to the LSAT on what somebody's going to be is a lawyer.</p><p end="4977" is_meta="false" speaker="Erwin Chemerinsky" start="4926">So let's not assume that these tests really measure qualifications.</p><p end="4977" is_meta="true" speaker="Erwin Chemerinsky" start="4926">applause</p><p end="4977" is_meta="false" speaker="Deborah Archer" start="4926">I would also just want to add a response to what you said.</p><p end="4977" is_meta="false" speaker="Deborah Archer" start="4926">I just want to add something to respond to --</p><p end="5050" is_meta="false" speaker="Deborah Archer" start="4977">Yes, but you claim that when you admit black and Latino students &#8211;</p><p end="5050" is_meta="false" speaker="Deborah Archer" start="4977">-- it somehow undermines the &#8211;</p><p end="5050" is_meta="false" speaker="Deborah Archer" start="4977">-- academic qualities .</p><p end="5099" is_meta="false" speaker="Roger Clegg" start="5050">I'm happy to take it.</p><p end="5099" is_meta="false" speaker="Roger Clegg" start="5050">The answer is that we do not treat people differently because of the color of their skin or what country their ancestors came from.</p><p end="5099" is_meta="true" speaker="Roger Clegg" start="5050">applause</p><p end="5099" is_meta="false" speaker="Deborah Archer" start="5050">I think the history and the purpose of the Equal Protection Clause shows that equal doesn't mean colorblind.</p><p end="5163" is_meta="false" speaker="Erwin Chemerinsky" start="5099">One thing we're doing is discussing this out of the context of American history. We're not talking about the long history of separate and unequal schools. We're not talking about the long history o f discrimination against African Americans. The purpose of the Equal Protection Clause was especially to prohibit subordination of minorities, try to get a more equal society based on race. That's why the same Congress that ratified the 14th Amendment al so adopted programs that today we call affirmative action .</p><p end="5163" is_meta="false" speaker="Roger Clegg" start="5099">Try again.</p><p end="5345" is_meta="false" speaker="Erwin Chemerinsky" start="5279">When I stood at the lectern , I issued a challenge t o my opponents. I said you could only vote affirmative if you find one of two things. I don't have to convince you that diversity in the classroom is unimportant or they must convince you there's another way to achieve diversity. I think they failed at both of those questions. As to the former,</p><p end="5345" is_meta="false" speaker="Erwin Chemerinsky" start="5279">diversity is compelling. The Supreme Court has said it time and again. It's like every college and university I know of engages in affirmative action . Some form of what we&#8217;re, tonight, calling racial preferenc e. Diversity matters in preparing all of our students for the society that they're going to deal with. The second question is , is there any other way to achieve diversity? The reason college universities engage in affirmative action is none has found an alternative. We talked in generalities, but I've got statistics. The University of California Davis Medical School found that without some form of affirmative action they would average less than one African American or Latino student a year in an entering class of a hundred.</p><p end="5404" is_meta="false" speaker="Erwin Chemerinsky" start="5345">When Proposition 209 was passed in California, five years after -- University of California Law School, a private school, 11.4 percent of the students are African American.

And the motion is: The Equal Protection Clause Forbids Racial Preferences in State University Admissions . And here summarizing his position in support of the motion, Roger Clegg, President and G eneral Counsel of the Center for Equal Opportunity.</p><p end="5460" is_meta="false" speaker="Roger Clegg" start="5404">Let me make one point at the outset. You've heard a lot about dispute social science evidence. And I would say that yes, this social science evidence is, to some extent,</p><p end="5460" is_meta="false" speaker="Roger Clegg" start="5404">disputed. I think that we have the better argument. But if the evidence is disputed,</p><p end="5460" is_meta="false" speaker="Roger Clegg" start="5404">then I think the other side loses, because there cannot be a compelling interest in something if it's not clear if that interest exists at all . Now, what you have to decide tonight is which of two very different visions of the role the Constitution allows rac e to play in state university admissions is .</p><p end="5518" is_meta="false" speaker="Roger Clegg" start="5460">O ur opponents think that it is fine if state education officials, for the foreseeable future -</p><p end="5518" is_meta="false" speaker="Roger Clegg" start="5460">- and probably forever -- look at the skin color and national origin of the students who apply to help d etermine who gets in . I don't think that this is the vision of the people who wrote the words of the 14th Amendment or the people who ratified it right after the Civil War had been fought . I think that when they said that , &#8220;N o state shall deny to any person the equal protection of the laws, &#8221; they said &#8220;No&#8221; to that kind of discrimination . The institutionalization of racial discrimination that our opponents support will become harder and harder to dismantle with every tick of the clock . It is not consi stent with the vision that we should have for our increasingly multiracial and multiethnic society .</p><p end="5576" is_meta="false" speaker="Roger Clegg" start="5518">In that society, by the way, blacks and whites are now the slowest growing groups . The fastest growing group is Asian Americans, and then Latinos, and then people who are themselves multiracial. For a society like that to work, there has to be mutual respect .</p><p end="5576" is_meta="false" speaker="Roger Clegg" start="5518">And for mutual respect, we must all be judged by the same standards . And we must know that other people are being judged by the same standards too . Please vote for the motion .</p><p end="5576" is_meta="true" speaker="Roger Clegg" start="5518">applause</p><p end="5576" is_meta="false" speaker="Deborah Archer" start="5518">I very quickly just want to respond to something that was said, that because there is some dispute -- very little dispute -- about whether or not mismatch exists, that it can't be the basis to say that diversity is a compelling interest . It's important to note the Supreme Court, in the first Fischer case, received all the information and data about mismatch and still ruled tha t diversity is a compelling state interest .</p><p end="5638" is_meta="false" speaker="Deborah Archer" start="5576">The 14th Amendment isn't about color -blindness . It is about equal citizenship. Indeed,</p><p end="5638" is_meta="false" speaker="Deborah Archer" start="5576">the purpose of the 14th Amendment was to constitutionalize race -conscious admissions -- to constitutionalize r ace-conscious programs . The framers of the 14th Amendment understood that considering race is sometimes necessary to achieve equality . It is perverse to argue that the constitutional amendment created to help turn America away from its legacy of racial oppression requires us to limit the opportunities available to students of color . Racial diversity in education is important and it is compelling . It is not about discriminating against anyone . It's not about denying opportunities to anyone because of t heir race. Race is not the only factor and it's not the deciding factor . I am certainly personally been a beneficiary of affirmative action programs, but I didn't get into college or into law school because of my race . Did the law school consider the fact that I'm a black woman, the child of immigrants, or the first person in my family to graduate from college when they accepted me?</p><p end="5693" is_meta="false" speaker="Deborah Archer" start="5638">Did it consider the fact that I was raised in a racially -segregated neighborhood, then moved to a white suburb , where I experienced racial discrimination? I hope so, because without it, they have no idea who I really am . And they have no idea what it took for me to get to where I am . My SAT scores, my LSAT scores, my GPA certainly did not tell my whole story . The Constitution promises equality to all people regardless of race . Today,</p><p end="5693" is_meta="false" speaker="Deborah Archer" start="5638">race matters . Not because it should, but because it does . And there's nothing in the Equal Protection Clause that says we have to ignore that reality. I urge you to vote agains t the motion. Thank you.</p></transcript></debate>
