Thank you to our host, moderator, and participants in this debate. My name is Nita Farahany . And I am here to convince you that college students should be allowed to take smart drugs. In a little while, you'll hear from my partner, Anjan Chatterjee, who will debunk many of the scientific claims against smart drugs. Before that, I want to convince you of two things. First, colleges should empower students to make their own choices about how they will change their brains.</p><p end="597" is_meta="false" speaker="Nita Farahany" start="544">And, second, the gradual improvement of our brains is a social good that we should pursue in society. Colleges should educate and empower students to make informed choices about smart drugs. There's a common saying in education that we should teach students how to think, not what to think. Teaching a student how to think encourages them to question their own bel ief and to question the claims that they are presented with. Banning smart drugs disempowers students from making educated choices for themselves. And it denies them their ability to think smarter. Being protective of students and telling them what to do to change their brains leaves students poorly prepared for life after college in a world that will present them with choices and with pressure. A campus culture built on prohibitions and policing students is a campus that is at odds with encouraging freedom of thought and liberty. It fosters fear and ignorance instead of courageous deliberation.</p><p end="654" is_meta="false" speaker="Nita Farahany" start="597">A recent online poll found one in five of the 1,400 respondents had used Ritalin, Provigil,</p><p end="654" is_meta="false" speaker="Nita Farahany" start="597">or beta blockers for non -medical purposes. Polls at in coming college freshmen show that at least one in three has used smart drugs. We can pretend that this isn't a choice that large swaths of people are already making. Or we can embrace that smart drugs are just one of the many ways that people exercise fr ee choices in their lives. Colleges are incredibly well-positioned to equip students with the information and the skills necessary to balance the risks and benefits of taking or foregoing these drugs. It's time that we recognize that college students are moral agents, capable of acting freely and making judgments for which they can be praised, blamed, or held responsible. We should respect their dignity and enable them to decide whether caffeine, prep classes,neural stimulation, exercise, or smart drugs are ways that they want to change their brains.</p><p end="715" is_meta="false" speaker="Nita Farahany" start="654">Look what's happening in high schools around the country when bans on so -called &#8220;dangerous substances&#8221; are being made. One school administrator from Indiana testified before Congress that high school students in his district are trafficking banned foods on school property thanks to a federal law prohibiting what can be served in school lunch rooms. Students have been caught bringing in -- even selling -- salt,</p><p end="715" is_meta="false" speaker="Nita Farahany" start="654">pepper, sugar in schools -- add ta ste to the bland and tasteless cafeteria food. This is a sad reality of what bans do in educational settings. They spur underground markets where the very goods prohibited become more alluring and go unchecked. This puts students at greater danger of ta king tampered substances without the benefit of transparency. Instead of banning salt, pepper, sugar, soda, or smart drugs, let's teach students how to weigh the risks and benefits and to make choices for themselves. This says nothing, of course, about the frightening intrusion into private lives of college students to enforce a ban on smart drugs.</p><p end="777" is_meta="false" speaker="Nita Farahany" start="715">Can you imagine regular screening and testing of students to try to detect taking these drugs? But I want to convince you of a second thin: that enhancing our brains is a social good that we should be pursuing. The gradual improvement in how our brains function is a social good worth pursuing, and a social good we pursue all the time. We enhance our brains all the time and every day, from coffee we drink first thing in the morning, to SAT prep classes we take to gain college admission, the music classes we enroll in, the basic nutrition we follow, the exercise we undertake, the classes we attend. All of these things change our brains, and that's a great thing. To the extent that smart drugs work to improve focus, motivation, attention, concentration, or memory -- we should celebrate them, not prohibit them. What if taking a smart drug gives us the capacity to study harder, longer, and better suc h that we cure cancer? Or develop tools for staying in better touch, resolving social ills, or for improving our overall happiness? Shouldn't we encourage, rather than ban, these opportunities?</p><p end="845" is_meta="false" speaker="Nita Farahany" start="777">Improving our brain functioning can influence i mportant outcomes for individuals, like making them more successful at work, enhancing their earning potential, alleviating their likelihood of experiencing social and economic difficulties, and improving their overall well-being. Widespread improvement i n cognitive function would result in widespread societal benefits, like economic gains or even reducing dangerous errors.</p><p end="845" is_meta="false" speaker="Nita Farahany" start="777">Shouldn't we encourage this? We shouldn't think of smart drugs like taking steroids in sports. Life isn't a competitive game, where there are winners and there are losers andspectators on the sidelines. Improving our brains is inherently valuable in and of itself.</p><p end="845" is_meta="false" speaker="Nita Farahany" start="777">And not because it offers some kind of competitive advantage for one person versus another. Improving our memory, our motivation, our concentration, our capacities improves our opportunities in life, which can mean better living conditions and greater flourishing for all of us. Knowledge is a good in and of itself. And using smart drugs to give us access to even more knowledge is truly invaluable.</p><p end="906" is_meta="false" speaker="Nita Farahany" start="845">We should celebrate and not prohibit these opportunities. You'll hear fear -mongering talks about coercion and the vulnerability of students tonight, on being on the slippery slope toward a dystopia and a rat race of enhancements. These fear tactics are just that: fear. Not only are smart drugs not bad, they may offer significant good. But regardless, it's up to college students as moral agents to decide for themselves. I urge you to vote in favor of personal choice and freedom, to vote in favor of educ ational institutions serving as educators and not nannies. And in favor of collectively improving our insights and our opportunities in life. Thank you.</p><p end="968" is_meta="false" speaker="Eric Racine" start="906">Good evening, members of the public, fellow debaters, and thank you, organizers for allowing me to come to Washington. It's always a welcome opportunity to warm up a little bit from the cold weather in Montreal. So tonight I hope to conv ince you that we should reject the motion that we have before us. And this won't be an enigmatic stance on my behalf. I think the facts, the scientific facts and sound reasoning and policy bring us there. I'll make two remarks in my short introductory remarks. First of all, I try to unpack a little bit the proposition before us. What do we mean by smart drugs, for example? Second, I'll try to highlight that there have been two major moral criteria put forward to assess these smart drugs. Moral acceptability and moral praise worthiness .And I think if you're committed to the foundations of both these tenses, you will reject the motion before us.</p><p end="1032" is_meta="false" speaker="Eric Racine" start="968">So first, a couple of remarks on the proposition. Smart drugs, do they exist? Well, if we look at scientific reviews that have been published on this, it doesn't seem to be the case. There is no scientific reviews suggesting that these drugs are efficacious, that they actually improve cognition and intelligence in those who use them. Furthermo re, we don't even know for whom they would work and what would be the risks entailed by their use on the long run. So I think smart drugs don't exist, so we don't have to allow them because, really, they're not -- we're not there yet. A second important piece of the proposition tonight is the allowing. Who should be doing the allowing? Should it be college students? Obviously, that would be a bit contradictory. Should it be college administrations? I could -- I think it could have destined [spelled phonetically] interests in pressure their students to use drugs to gain advantage.</p><p end="1083" is_meta="false" speaker="Eric Racine" start="1032">Physicians, probably not also -- they could have also an interest in caring for the worried well. So I think this is really a question that we should be answeri ng and tackling at the very highest level of moral and political analysis. It concerns all of us, because if once, if ever, these drugs are out of the barn and start getting more traction, all of us will be concerned. It will impact college environments, the workplace and so on. Second setof remarks: Now, what are the moral criteria to assess if this is ethical? Should we be engaging in cognitive enhancement and the use of smart drugs? As I mentioned, two major moral positions have been put on the table. I'll try to explain them very briefly and come back to it in the Q and A.</p><p end="1145" is_meta="false" speaker="Eric Racine" start="1083">First of all, moral acceptability is basically capturing a basic set of concerns and trying at liberal democracy. If, for example, tonight you were worried from the ethics standpoint,</p><p end="1145" is_meta="false" speaker="Eric Racine" start="1083">if ever college students would be free and autonomous in making such de cisions, that's a concern reflected in moral acceptability. If you thought that perhaps we didn't have or were concerned that we didn't have the data to suggest that these drugs were safe and efficacious, that's also a fundamental condition of basic moral acceptability. And we don't have these data. We don't pilot studies about the autonomy of students. We don't have convincing data that these drugs work. So I think from the standpoint of moral acceptability, we need to reject the proposition. But furthermore, if you were concerned by other types of issues that we capture under the label of moral praiseworthiness, you could also be rejecting the motion.</p><p end="1205" is_meta="false" speaker="Eric Racine" start="1145">If, for example, from the ethics standpoint, you were worried that perhaps this is not a genuine way to achieve oneself, it is not a proper way to seek self -fulfillment. That it's somehow cheating or threatening our moral ideals. That's a concern captured under the label of "moral praiseworthiness." If, from the medical and scientific standpoint you were worried that perhaps physicians would be diverted as a resource from attending to important neurological or psychiatric conditions, for example, that would be a concern captured under the umbrella of moral praiseworthiness, i.e., is this p ractice morally laudable and praiseworthy? And the answer is no. No, because we haven't really debated this issue. We haven't made up our minds. We haven't been discussing with our neighbors and in public enough to really know if this is something we w ant to generally pursue.</p><p end="1268" is_meta="false" speaker="Eric Racine" start="1205">So I hope to have convinced you that it is premature at this point in time to consider the practice of using smart drugs to be, A, morally acceptable, and B, moreover, morally praiseworthy. And if you're still convinc ed yet, my colleague and partner, Nicole Vincent, will stretch the arguments further to show that even if you would grant some minimal moral acceptability to the practice, there would be still substantive issues to grasp with. Thank you.</p><p end="1686" is_meta="false" speaker="Nicole Vincent" start="1629">Thank you. So in March this year, the Presidential Commission for the Study of Bioethical Issues released a report called, "Gray Matters: Volume Two." The report recommended, amon g other things, that once we develop safe and effective medications, safe and effective smart drugs, we should make sure that they are made available equally to everyone.</p><p end="1743" is_meta="false" speaker="Nicole Vincent" start="1686">I am very much in favor of equality, and I'm really glad that the commis sion which Nita over there is indeed on recognized and was sensitive to this right. This -- we need more of this in politics. But here is my worry, that in focusing on the medical side effects, on all the medical problems, what they've actually overlooke d is they've overlooked all the other ways that our lives can go really bad, not just because we've had various medical problems, worse than this. What I'm going to argue is that actually by providing equal access to these medications to everyone, all the things that we really value are going to be jeopardized. So what are the arguments in favor of smart drugs? So I'm just going to be talking about the safe and effective ones, right? These are the -- this is the science fiction future.</p><p end="1806" is_meta="false" speaker="Nicole Vincent" start="1743">Presume that the arguments would go something like this. Here's one, "Hey, maybe if I can have access to these medications, which don't have any bad side effects, maybe I can get through all the work that I need to get through quickly." "And what then?" "Well, I&#8217;ll have spare time," right? And why is that good? Because then I can go and do the things that I really want to do -- spend time with my family, maybe stare atthe ceiling, which is my, you know, favorite occupation, while listening to music. Or perhaps being students -- hey, you need to make sure that you can earn an income.</p><p end="1806" is_meta="false" speaker="Nicole Vincent" start="1743">Actually have enough time for a part -time job. But would this actually happen? I don't think that would. And here's why. So, when you start taking these medications - - and suppose that they work, like they do for everyone.And you think, &#8220;Great, now I want to make sure that I'll get this work done and in half the time, maybe, and then I'll go off home.&#8221; Do you think everybody else is going to do this as well? Or do yo u think some people might say, &#8220;Huh, I'm going to work as much time as I would have, but I'll now get much better grades.&#8221;</p><p end="1868" is_meta="false" speaker="Nicole Vincent" start="1806">Some people might say, &#8220;Actually, look, guess what, I'm still not tired. I'm going to keep working. I'm going to make sure that I get awesome grades.&#8221; Think of what this does to your grades -- you've done a sufficiently good job. You've pulled the party line.</p><p end="1868" is_meta="false" speaker="Nicole Vincent" start="1806">Unfortunately, their actions are going to force you to not be able to get the very thing that you wanted -- the extra time to make sure that you get those things that you wanted, right? Time with family. Time for you to relax or whatever else it is. They're going to force you to have to also give those things up through competition. Very simple. Here's another way in which I think people think that smart drugs might be helpful. It could get -- maybe you can get better grades. Get that really awesome job,</p><p end="1868" is_meta="false" speaker="Nicole Vincent" start="1806">right? But remember, if everyone has access to those awesome medications, the ones that work for everyone -- what if we figured it out -- and in that particular scenario, all of us get exactly the same advantages.</p><p end="1920" is_meta="false" speaker="Nicole Vincent" start="1868">So, all the pe ople who could get into those lovely professions -- it's still them who can only get into those professions. So, unless you get a head start, you're an early adopter,</p><p end="1920" is_meta="false" speaker="Nicole Vincent" start="1868">you won't get the advantage. But think of what happens if you do get the early advantag e, because you're an early adopter. Well, you initially extend your reach and you get into that position. Great. But then, of course, you've gotten into this new cadre. You've made life more difficult for them. The more people like you get into that particular cadre, the more they're going to feel like, &#8220;Man, now I've got to compete harder.&#8221; Either they work harder or they say -- draw the obvious conclusion -- lso take the smart drugs. The longer you remain committed to this position, all that's going to happen is that more people will enter into this particular field and start using smart drugs for exactly those same reasons.</p><p end="1982" is_meta="false" speaker="Nicole Vincent" start="1920">Eventually, once everybody else is on smart drugs, you will simply lose all that investment and time. And you wil l lose your job, because we'll simply go back up to the same normal. Everybody's going to equally benefit. It doesn't strike me that either ofthose strategies is going to actually get us those things that we want. If anything, they may even lead us to disaster. Now, the real arguments, I think, have to do with the sort of things that Nita over there pointed out -- the possibility of scientific discovery, the possibility of better learning, right? Maybe we can develop better medications, cure cancer. Maybe we can develop better smart drugs. But this does not come without a cost. What -- the cost is that when you insert smart drugs into the equation, into a really competitive society, what you are doing is you are increasing competition. You are making it possible for some people to up the ante even more. They can now say, &#8220;I am actually going to try and get a further advantage. And I am going to work harder.&#8221;</p><p end="2052" is_meta="false" speaker="Nicole Vincent" start="1982">Competition will increase. It's not going to decrease. The amount of time that you're going to have to do all those other things isn't going to be greater. It'll be less. If you care for all the other things in your life, think about what you will be using to purchase that lifestyle. I only came to this country two -and -a -half y ears ago. And I've lived in six countries. People here work so hard -- harder than any other country I've lived in. Do you really want to smart drugs, that are going to make you into even better -oiled machines that can be like gladiators -- getting rid of all the time in your life and not be able to get all the things that make life worth living? Nita and Anjan would you like you to vote for the proposition. That vote closes the door on the this particular discussion--</p><p end="2052" is_meta="false" speaker="Nicole Vincent" start="1982">Thank you.</p><p end="2287" is_meta="false" speaker="Eric Racine" start="2229">Well, I think it's also important to acknowledge that we also lack data on the efficacy of these drugs. The risk would be, you know, fairly moderate to low . But at the same time, we don't have good efficacy data, so why do something which may involve moderate risks, but actually pans out to nothing?</p><p end="2287" is_meta="false" speaker="Eric Racine" start="2229">Absolutely not.</p><p end="2287" is_meta="false" speaker="Eric Racine" start="2229">Exactly.</p><p end="2342" is_meta="false" speaker="Eric Racine" start="2287">Exactly. You know, and one concerning aspect of the data alluded to in the discussion is the fact that these drugs could enhance motivation. You could be more eager to work .</p><p end="2342" is_meta="false" speaker="Eric Racine" start="2287">Yet those effects could be those also responsible for their addictive properties. So, you know, there are things we don't know about these drugs. And if there's actually nothing panning out in terms of benefits, it's not worth the risk . That's usually how we weigh other kinds of decisions. Moreover, when people are ill and really have serious health conditions, we are willing to take some risks . But when someone's healthy, you know, if it ain't broke, don't fix it.</p><p end="2342" is_meta="false" speaker="Eric Racine" start="2287">John Donvan:Nita Farahany.</p><p end="2342" is_meta="false" speaker="Nita Farahany" start="2287">I appreciate that Anjan is as responsible as a scientist as he is to be as cautious in his conclusions. But the data are better than I think Anjan gives credit to .</p><p end="2397" is_meta="false" speaker="Nita Farahany" start="2342">And so a recent meta- analysis that was just established about Modafinil showed in fact it does appear to be efficacious. It does seem to work and help . And I can attest as somebody who has tried Modafinil that it is something that in fact does improve for me,</p><p end="2397" is_meta="false" speaker="Nita Farahany" start="2342">personally, my wakefulness, my ability to concentrate.</p><p end="2397" is_meta="false" speaker="Nita Farahany" start="2342">It was -- it was --</p><p end="2397" is_meta="false" speaker="Nita Farahany" start="2342">It was developed to fight narcolepsy . It has been tested in Air Force pilots . It has been tested in the broader population. There are quite a few studies that show that not only does it improve things like motor coordination but also potentially performance IQ . And it appears to come without the kind of jittery side effects that things like caffeine do .</p><p end="2397" is_meta="false" speaker="Nita Farahany" start="2342">Likewise, depending on how we categorize smart drugs, which I think should be quite broad, there are drugs that improve memory. We know that these work for people who have dementia and Alzheimer's . They also appear to benefit working memory for people who do not have those types of conditions .</p><p end="2460" is_meta="false" speaker="Nita Farahany" start="2397">And to Anjan's point, rather than oversell the benefits, the benefits clearly seem to be there . We need much bigger studies to fully understand what the benefits are . The risks do not seem to be there in any significant way . And so given that the direction of the studies all seem to support quite a bit of efficacy, from my perspective, this kind of precautionary principle approach, which is wait until there's much more data,</p><p end="2460" is_meta="false" speaker="Nita Farahany" start="2397">undermined the ability of people to look at the data, educate them about it and be able to make their own informed choices about whether or not it's worth it to them.</p><p end="2460" is_meta="false" speaker="Nita Farahany" start="2397">John Donvan:And Nicole Vincent, your argument is sort of data neutral . I mean, you're actually imagining a world where they solve all of these problems, and you still think the problem would exist.</p><p end="2460" is_meta="false" speaker="Nicole Vincent" start="2397">I still think the problem would exist, but I'll just make two comments about the benefits and [unintelligible] motivation and with regards to the risks and what we should do about them . So, notice that when people talk a bout motivation, that modafinil increases your motivation to do the work, here's basically what it does .</p><p end="2516" is_meta="false" speaker="Nicole Vincent" start="2460">If you've got a very boring task, it'll make it a lot easier for you to do it . That's what that means, right ? And that's not cool because there's loads of boring tasks we all have to do . Only prob lem with that is that's precisely the kind of scenario that troubles me about the future . If I can't note of the fact that the things that I'm doing are extraordinarily boring, maybe even useless, you know, no meaning, that's a good reason for me not to do that, not to become blind to that . But in regards to the risks, it's easy to -- scientists are awesome in that there's always a scientist that says, look, actually,</p><p end="2516" is_meta="false" speaker="Nicole Vincent" start="2460">the risks are great . Another scientist says, the risks are not so great . And I am not properly qualified to comment on that. But, prohibition based on risks is not based on the idea that I'm going to tell somebody who wants to take the risk, but you're not allowed to . That 's not the idea, right ?</p><p end="2582" is_meta="false" speaker="Nicole Vincent" start="2516">The idea is the sam e as what happened with doping in sports , that I don't want those people to take the medications and then push everybody to have to do that as well, to coerce them and diminish their freedom, because somebody decided to do that.</p><p end="2645" is_meta="false" speaker="Nita Farahany" start="2582">So, I take Nicole's position to basically be an anti- competition argument, and that she would like to have us all be somehow equal. I think that Kurt Vonnegut imagined such aworld in a short story that he wrote as well where we made everybody exactly equal and everybody exactly the same . That wasn't a pretty future . It was a science fiction story for a reason. I think it is true that society continues to progress . That's a wonderful thing . We could call that a bad thing, that it forces us to keep up.</p><p end="2709" is_meta="false" speaker="Nita Farahany" start="2645">But I bet most of you in this audience, if not all of you, have smartphones, and those smartphones have enabled you to do lots of things, including remember things that you would never remember, like lots of people's phone numbers . And the fact that many people actually took things like an SAT prep course and many people did things like read to their children or were read to as a child . All of these things improve humanity by enabling us to get to the next step in life, to get to the next stage of our evolution as a society and as a people . And you can call that "competition," you can call that "forcing,"</p><p end="2709" is_meta="false" speaker="Nita Farahany" start="2645">or you could call that "opportunities that open a world of avenues for each of us."</p><p end="2709" is_meta="false" speaker="Eric Racine" start="2645">I feel like I need to say something about that, right?</p><p end="2709" is_meta="true" speaker="Eric Racine" start="2645">laughter</p><p end="2709" is_meta="false" speaker="Eric Racine" start="2645">No, I think we're clearly not . I thin k we're committed to, what science says and what kind of evidence we have about the impact of the use of these drugs on social environments lik e college environments .</p><p end="2756" is_meta="false" speaker="Eric Racine" start="2709">And we actually don't have much data on that. So we're just saying, "Hey, you know,</p><p end="2824" is_meta="false" speaker="Eric Racine" start="2756">You know, the data that we have on the general population suggests that this is something marginal and something which is actually completed by the fact that when the data are gathered on the nonmedical uses of these drugs, the nonmedical uses include partying, getting high on the drugs , and sometimes also, studying better, so it's all messed up in terms of prevalence data, epidemiological data that would actually inform us on the trends . So I think the point about mitigating the risks actually is a moot point because if we're really concerned about, you know, the extent of the practice and we think that allowing would be a way to inform and mitigate, actually, no, I think we're promoting, because at this point there is so few doing this that we're just basical ly making it -- we're publicizing it I think.</p><p end="2881" is_meta="false" speaker="Nita Farahany" start="2824">Can I take up, John, your --</p><p end="2881" is_meta="false" speaker="Nita Farahany" start="2824">-- your -- you brought us back to sports for a moment to say, you know, in sports we say,</p><p end="2881" is_meta="false" speaker="Nita Farahany" start="2824">"It's wrongful." And we have decided that, and I think that's okay . We can decide that.</p><p end="2881" is_meta="false" speaker="Nita Farahany" start="2824">We might also make a different choice. We might decide we'd rather watch baseball where everybody takes ster oids and hits homeruns and that that might be more fun for us. But we're spectators, and they're players . And that is a game that we like to watch and that we've decided what we want the rules to be. We're not in a game here . This is real life, and college students are in real life . And after they leave college, they will also be presented with the same choices as to whether or not they want to take cognitive enhancers, if they want to take a ny other kind of drug, if they want to have a smartphone, if they want to take music classes, whatever they might want to do .</p><p end="2943" is_meta="false" speaker="Nita Farahany" start="2881">And we can either protect them from having to make those choices and facing what the risks and benefits of it are in college, or we could decide that college is the perfect place to change the way they think by enabling them to have the information to make choices for themselves . Students should be equipped with the information about what the side effects and the benefi ts are. They should be equipped to decide and evaluate that information, and if colleges are in the business of nannying rather than educating,</p><p end="2943" is_meta="false" speaker="Nita Farahany" start="2881">they're taking a moral position about what they think students should do rather than teaching students to think for themselves . I think that at this point, given the data, we should give students the opportunities to think for themselves . And it would be perfectly fine if not legitimate for people to decide not to . To Eric's point, many already do . These drugs are available . To be voting against the resolution would be voting to change the status quo . The status quo doesn't have that kind of future dystopia that Nicole spells out . Instead, what it has is some people making the choice and some people not.</p><p end="3004" is_meta="false" speaker="Nicole Vincent" start="2943">I almost agree with everything that Nita says, right ? And that's what's so interesting --</p><p end="3004" is_meta="false" speaker="Nicole Vincent" start="2943">that I mean, we always agree, but then we disagree . I want to respond to what you said about [unintelligible] competition. Indeed, these medications aren't the problem . The problem is what they enable us to do . The problem is the degree to which they make it possible for me to start sacrificing everything that I would like to have over other things -- the time with my family, the time for myself -- to do silly things like go to the cinema and so on and so forth.</p><p end="3068" is_meta="false" speaker="Nicole Vincent" start="3004">The pressure of competition is indeed what leads people to then encroach on their own values. So, I agree . It's a social problem. It's n ot a problem with the drugs. But in the --</p><p end="3068" is_meta="false" speaker="Nicole Vincent" start="3004">but in ter ms of, am I trying to conjure some dystopia -- absolutely not. Am I anti-</p><p end="3068" is_meta="false" speaker="Nicole Vincent" start="3004">progress? Again, no . The simple idea is that yes, as Nita says, this is about real life . It's not about setting some arbitrary rule . In real life -- real things matter. It's not just whether you manage to get this kind or that kind of performance in sport, or something else . We have real ways in which our lives can go worse and go better. Now, sure, it's very important to provide people information. But one piece of this important information -- which has been completely kept out of the debate -- has been this point about the social side effects, and what exactly will be lost. It had been framed as a bioethics, as a medical debate, as a neuroethics debate .</p><p end="3131" is_meta="false" speaker="Nicole Vincent" start="3068">And that's what we've been worrying about. But that's not the point that we are making. There are many ways that your life can go bad, even if you don't get a brain tumor. Like, for instance, you become that amazing gladiator. And all you do is you compete, right? That's the point.</p><p end="3131" is_meta="false" speaker="Nicole Vincent" start="3068">John Donvan:What -- and would that be a bad thing ? Nita Farahany.</p><p end="3131" is_meta="false" speaker="Nita Farahany" start="3068">[laughs ] If people became automatons and lost their ability to make choices, yeah, that would be a bad thing . I just have a little bit more faith in college students and a little bit more faith in people than suddenly sacrificing everything they believe in. What -- thank you . Go ahead, clap please .</p><p end="3131" is_meta="true" speaker="Nita Farahany" start="3068">applause</p><p end="3131" is_meta="false" speaker="Nita Farahany" start="3068">But I think one of the mistakes that Nicole makes is to assume that when a person chooses to excel in an academic environment or in some other way that is competition -</p><p end="3131" is_meta="false" speaker="Nita Farahany" start="3068">driven, that that is somehow not their value, and that when they spend time with their children or their families -- although I hope that not that many college students have children at this stage -- that they are somehow not choosing their values .</p><p end="3183" is_meta="false" speaker="Nita Farahany" start="3131">But in fact, competition is just a value that they're choosing to maximize . If they're choosing to get ahead because they will create more opportunities for themselves, for their families, for their lives, and the future, they are choosing to prioritize that value over some other value . If they decide they'd rather study or work harder, they're choosing to prioritize that over partying and drinking . And I think that's great. That's the whole idea, is that people should be able to make those choices, evaluate their own values, decide which ones they want to maximize and which ones they don't. I just don't believe that creating competition forces people to give up everything about who they are . It gives them the opportunity to advance, to flourish, and creates more opportunities for society and for individuals.</p><p end="3238" is_meta="false" speaker="Nicole Vincent" start="3183">Thanks --</p><p end="3238" is_meta="false" speaker="Nicole Vincent" start="3183">Okay. So, I think there are extremely important workplace relations issues here . So,</p><p end="3238" is_meta="false" speaker="Nicole Vincent" start="3183">notice that the things I'm drawing attention to have to do with the way in which people will compete, right ? And the degree to which people may simply not be able to resist --</p><p end="3238" is_meta="false" speaker="Nicole Vincent" start="3183">the sort of pressure that Nita characterizes as pressure which impinge on freedom --</p><p end="3238" is_meta="false" speaker="Nicole Vincent" start="3183">man . When somebody, you know, points a gun at my head and says, &#8220;Nicole, money or your life.&#8221; And I cho ose to say, &#8220;Okay, money.&#8221; Did I freely choose that ? I guess.. .</p><p end="3307" is_meta="false" speaker="Nicole Vincent" start="3238">Now, people who are already disadvantaged, people who are already don't have a lot of political power -- they are the ones that are most likely -- factory workers -- to be put in a situation of having their employers trying to squeeze out yet more blood out of them,</p><p end="3307" is_meta="false" speaker="Nicole Vincent" start="3238">get more value . They're the ones that won't have the political powe r to say actually, I would like to make sure that I have a good life . So in terms of social stratification, if you could wipe out existing power structures, those would still be the sort problems that I described. But right now, when I think back to even examples like in Australia, where a cabin crew was saying, hey, guys, don't make us work for 20 hours a day because it's unsafe. This was on a budget carrier. Well, imagine the s ame employer had said, oh,</p><p end="3307" is_meta="false" speaker="Nicole Vincent" start="3238">you're right. Thanks for pointing that out . We don't want to have accidents . Bad for the airline. Here, now as a condition, you take modafinil . You're no longer unsafe .</p><p end="3307" is_meta="false" speaker="Nicole Vincent" start="3238">That's not something that I want to see happening . People who are marginalized becoming yet more marginalized.</p><p end="3484" is_meta="false" speaker="Nita Farahany" start="3422">I think it's a great question and an important one . And there's a few kind of interesting things to put into the mix. I agree with Anjan has said, that it's unclear as to how it plays out . There's real interesting studies that show how these drugs affect people are very different. People, for example, at higher levels of performance IQ may not get as much benefit as people at lower level s of performance IQ, which would suggest if there was access, that people -- that the gap would narrow between people . And that's a gap that could in some ways be made up. So students come into college already with significant differences in the advantages that they've already had.</p><p end="3546" is_meta="false" speaker="Nita Farahany" start="3484">And this has the kind of counter intuitive effect of potentially narrowing rather than widening the gap. But it depends on access . And so making things cheaply available and increasing research and access rather than driving things underground and to a black market that makes them more expensive, from my perspective is a better way of equalizing access and the benefits of the drug s. It's important, I think, to keep in mind,</p><p end="3546" is_meta="false" speaker="Nita Farahany" start="3484">when we hear Eric and Nicole talking ab out some of their concerns, they're talking about factory workers, they're talking about the workplace environment . They're not talking about our resolution . Our resolution is about whether or not college students should be allowed to take smart drugs . And we aren't going to be banning it in society as a whole. We're talking about taking this small segment of people and saying, you can't have access to it. But once you get out of college, you're going to be presented with exactly the same choices of whether or not you have access to it. There's no reason why we would just take this little bubble and say, you can't have it, but everybody else can. That, to me, seems like a bad choice for us to make.</p><p end="3661" is_meta="false" speaker="Nita Farahany" start="3607">First of all, I wouldn't prohibit athletes from taking it. So, I mean, to start with, I think --</p><p end="3661" is_meta="true" speaker="Nita Farahany" start="3607">applause</p><p end="3661" is_meta="false" speaker="Nita Farahany" start="3607">That's the starting place . But if you decide that you are actually opposed to steroids,</p><p end="3661" is_meta="false" speaker="Nita Farahany" start="3607">and you still need to be pushed over the edge as to why college students should be allowed to take smart drugs, it's different in two important ways for me .</p><p end="3723" is_meta="false" speaker="Nita Farahany" start="3661">One is, the effects of steroids are different than the side effects of smart drugs . Smart drugs appear to be much safer, much more tolerable, and have far fewer implications,</p><p end="3723" is_meta="false" speaker="Nita Farahany" start="3661">long term for life . The second is, I feel like if we want to pick whatever it is we want to buy tickets to and celebrate, we can set whatever rules we want for that game . We can say, this is a game, and we the spectators have decided that what we want is to celebrate honed talent that is natural . It's arbitrary, but we could decide that . We could just as easily decide we only want to watch people who are enhanced. That would be okay. I don't think life and cognitive abilities are the same as improving your performance in sports . I think real life is about continuing to improve what we know,</p><p end="3723" is_meta="false" speaker="Nita Farahany" start="3661">knowledge, grow, and to enhance our abilities . So I think everything --</p><p end="3723" is_meta="false" speaker="Nita Farahany" start="3661">-- we do is about cognitive enhancement.</p><p end="3791" is_meta="false" speaker="Eric Racine" start="3723">In terms of the analogy, I think there are interesting similarities, dissimilarities . Some aspects which are different I think is just the sheer amount of people concerned.</p><p end="3791" is_meta="false" speaker="Eric Racine" start="3723">Professional athletes are, you know, Olympic athletes, it's a very small crowd. Talking about college students is a huge amount of people who would basically go some kind of massive experimentation of trying these drugs without due knowledge about their e ffects and efficacy . So I think there are interesting parallels . I'm just -- you know, the magnitude of the context is really different . And --</p><p end="3791" is_meta="false" speaker="Nicole Vincent" start="3723">No.</p><p end="3791" is_meta="false" speaker="Nicole Vincent" start="3723">Okay. So Nita is again -- see, I keep agreeing with her . Nita is again completely right that, what we choose to pay our money for, what sort of -- whether it's enhanced sport</p><p end="3791" is_meta="false" speaker="Nicole Vincent" start="3723">or whether it's not enhanced sport, au naturel. You know, let them choose .</p><p end="3840" is_meta="false" speaker="Nicole Vincent" start="3791">The -- now, if people then pretend that they're actually, not using enhancers, you know,</p><p end="3840" is_meta="false" speaker="Nicole Vincent" start="3791">sport whe re it's meant to be au naturel , that's cheating. That's -- that doesn't strike me as, whoa, man, wrong . The difference in this sort of debate, right, is that very real things are at stake, not just a matt er of, hey, let's set up an enhanced board. Let's set up a different league. We are actually unavoidably competing with one another as students . And the reason why it's cheating is because whatever it is that everyone does,</p><p end="3840" is_meta="false" speaker="Nicole Vincent" start="3791">that's the only thing that we can -- that everyone else is going to be bound by . If the rules are for everyone, don't use this, then using it becomes a form of cheating . So very different context.</p><p end="4090" is_meta="false" speaker="Nicole Vincent" start="4019">Notice I don't actually think that there is a -- there is ever going to be a principal difference between different kinds of enhancement, you know . So is there a difference between, for instance, spending late nights studying or perhaps no t having to spend those nights studying by taking Ritalin or modafinil or whatever else? That's not where you're going to find the principal difference .</p><p end="4153" is_meta="false" speaker="Nicole Vincent" start="4090">The cup of coffee is another example . Here's the difference . The difference that we're trying to draw attention to is the way in which certain kinds of medications can make,</p><p end="4153" is_meta="false" speaker="Nicole Vincent" start="4090">indeed, competition much, much tougher, so tough that we'll be placed i n certain situations that none of us actually want to be ever placed in, to have to make choices because other people decided that they're prepared to sacrifice loads of important things . Now, I am not the paragon of a good life . Whatever things I like, you don't have to [spelled phonetically] like those . That's not the point. The point is that any</p><p end="4153" is_meta="false" speaker="Nicole Vincent" start="4090">medication that makes it possible for people to extend their ability to stay awake, to be productive for an extremely long period of time, when you give people c apacities,</p><p end="4153" is_meta="false" speaker="Nicole Vincent" start="4090">capacities to extend themselves, what they do is they say, "Wow, I can now start be ing more competitive. I can make myself -- put myself in a better position."</p><p end="4207" is_meta="false" speaker="Nicole Vincent" start="4153">The difference here is exactly that, that it enables people to make choices to set a fertile ground for, A.) others to make choices which will be coercive, coercive because they know -- produce pressures on us to sacrifice important things.</p><p end="4207" is_meta="false" speaker="Nicole Vincent" start="4153">A.), coffee doesn't have the power . But, B.) notice that we all seem to be assuming that the world is better with coffee. And I'm a big coffee drinker. I --</p><p end="4207" is_meta="true" speaker="Nicole Vincent" start="4153">laughter</p><p end="4207" is_meta="false" speaker="Nicole Vincent" start="4153">-- seriously . I'm a huge coffee drinker . Now, do I think the world would be better without coffee? I really honestly don't know . It might be. But imagine if the world were --</p><p end="4207" is_meta="false" speaker="Nicole Vincent" start="4153">Yes.</p><p end="4207" is_meta="false" speaker="Nicole Vincent" start="4153">John Donvan:-- what's wrong w ith taking Ritalin, that does a little more of this? I mean, it seems very straightforward.</p><p end="4274" is_meta="false" speaker="Nicole Vincent" start="4207">Exactly. That would -- what coffee does, it does a little bit of this . Well, then, it doesn't provide yet the sufficient amount of ability to encroach upon the things that are valuable in our lives.</p><p end="4274" is_meta="false" speaker="Nicole Vincent" start="4207">That's the whole point.</p><p end="4274" is_meta="false" speaker="Nita Farahany" start="4207">I think it's an utterly arbitrary --</p><p end="4274" is_meta="false" speaker="Nita Farahany" start="4207">-- distinction. And I think it privileges drugs and assumes that drugs other than caffeine are far more powerful than they actually are . These are yet another way in which we can change our abilities, and that -- yet another way in which we can change our brains .</p><p end="4274" is_meta="false" speaker="Nita Farahany" start="4207">They may not even be more effective. In fact, neural feedback has been shown, in many instances, using EEG and a game on your iPhone, to be more effecti ve than taking these drugs for ADD. And I think giving students the data, enabling them to see what's effective, what isn't, what are the side effects, what aren't they -- having an open,</p><p end="4274" is_meta="false" speaker="Nita Farahany" start="4207">transparent dialogue on college campuses, where you equip students to make choices in light of those distinctions is valuable -- including letting them decide whether or not it's arbitrary, whether or not they want to take coffee and whether or not it gives them an unfair advantage .</p><p end="4321" is_meta="false" speaker="Nita Farahany" start="4274">They can make all of those choices if we equip them with the knowledge, not if we ban the knowledge from them and ban them from having the choice to begin with.</p><p end="4321" is_meta="false" speaker="Nita Farahany" start="4274">John Donvan:Okay. I want to take one more question . And -- in the white shirt here . Yeah . And a mike is coming from your right -hand side. When you're looking at your phone, it makes me think you wrote down your question .</p><p end="4321" is_meta="true" speaker="Nita Farahany" start="4274">laughter</p><p end="4321" is_meta="false" speaker="Nita Farahany" start="4274">You don't have to do that. Just let it flow .</p><p end="4321" is_meta="true" speaker="Nita Farahany" start="4274">laughter</p><p end="4384" is_meta="false" speaker="Eric Racine" start="4321">Well, I think your question there is right on, in terms of who's really evaluating and assessing these drugs for their ability to enhance cognition in healthy individuals . No one is really . No one has approved those drugs for cognitive enhancement purposes .</p><p end="4384" is_meta="false" speaker="Eric Racine" start="4321">So -- and how to do that, I think, needs attention. That's why I think we're saying, &#8220;Let's be cautious. Let's figure out how we could actually do that.&#8221; Because no one has expertise in doing that. Second of all, where are the drugs coming from? I think it's an open question. Black market, reselling . So, I think that speaks to the really fuzzy practices that are going on.</p><p end="4444" is_meta="false" speaker="Eric Racine" start="4384">And you know, it speaks to the value of the claims that these drugs have enhancement effects. They could have huge placebo effects . That's something we can probably bet on . There are enhancement effects . What kind of drugs people are using, from whom,</p><p end="4444" is_meta="false" speaker="Eric Racine" start="4384">and so on, I think, are cle arly important question --</p><p end="4619" is_meta="false" speaker="Eric Racine" start="4555">Enhancement in principle -- in principle could be a laudable goal. The problem is smart drugs are just the wrong end to get to it. Actually it's a dead end or no means to get there. But I would hate to be arguing only against tonight. And fortunately I think there are genuine ways for indiv iduals and societies to improve themselves . It's not rocket science. It's not smart drugs . It's basic -- and, plain and boring, it's education.</p><p end="4683" is_meta="false" speaker="Eric Racine" start="4619">We know from societies that invest the most in their education systems that that pans out in terms of preexisting socioeconomic status, and also we also interestingly know that investing in education and childhood literacy is one of the best ways to improve the health status of individ uals and populations. So I think -- and this is something that has been alluded to throughout the debate -- if we're really genuinely committed to enhancement and improvement of individua l lives and collectivities-- the only thing we lack is really political will to make this a priority and use the means that we know that are efficacious, and not controversial, it's not rocket science, but it works.</p><p end="4683" is_meta="false" speaker="Nita Farahany" start="4619">I have a confession to make . I take smart drugs.</p><p end="4747" is_meta="true" speaker="Nita Farahany" start="4683">applause</p><p end="4747" is_meta="false" speaker="Nita Farahany" start="4683">When I'm tired, I drink coffee . When I'm anxious or I can't sleep, I take tranquilizers or sleeping medications. I've tried beta blockers, modafinil, memory enhancers . And I've been lucky enough to have a legitimate prescription for all of these things . But that's a matter of luck and privileged access, not anything else. For me the drugs can take the edge off. They can enable me to concentrate . They can enable me to spend all day lo ng concentrating on Facebook or all day long concentrating on a piece of scholarship that I want to write. They might motivate you and give you abilities, but they don't [unintelligible ] for you whether or not you choose to spend your time on something like work or somewhere else . I've had more confidence at times . I've been more relaxed at others . I've been more awake when arriving in international destinations . I think these are all great things .</p><p end="4802" is_meta="false" speaker="Nita Farahany" start="4747">I've done so fully informed of risks an d benefits of taking drugs that alter my brain and my bodily chemistry. I've done so without fear of reprisal, and I've don e so as a choice,a decidedly personal one, an individual one, and one that has improved my life. Not everyone should take smart drugs. They don't benefit everyone the same. There are risks and benefits to each and every one of them. But that's true of every choice we make in life. And college students should be empowered to choose whether or not to take smart drugs. And colleges are in the best position to empower them to do so. I urge you to vote for the resolution. Vote for liberty. Vote for choice. Vote to allow college students to take smart drugs. Thank you.</p><p end="4867" is_meta="true" speaker="Nita Farahany" start="4802">applause</p><p end="4867" is_meta="false" speaker="Nicole Vincent" start="4802">Okay. So, I never actually thought that I would be a professor, seriously. When I was 17, I dropped out of -- well, I left home. I dropped out of high school. I spent two years taking drugs and going to warehouse parties.</p><p end="4867" is_meta="true" speaker="Nicole Vincent" start="4802">laughter</p><p end="4867" is_meta="false" speaker="Nicole Vincent" start="4802">Seriously. I was very lucky in that I met somebody who set me on the right track. And over literally 20 years of education &#8211; at the age of 39 , which is right about the end of 2010 -- I was awarded two research grants, huge research grants. One in the Netherlands, to research the social effects and legal effects of smart drugs. And another one in Australia, to do with law and neuroscience. I said, &#8220;Yeah, give it to me.&#8221; And I took both of them, right? And I really bit off a lot more than I could chew.</p><p end="4928" is_meta="false" speaker="Nicole Vincent" start="4867">I had to travel between two countries, and I had no time. My relationship was going down, gurgler. When modafinil was offered to me, I did take m odafinil. And guess what? It indeed increased my abilities. It increased my capacities. I was extremely productive. Look at my publication record right around 2011. It's great.</p><p end="4928" is_meta="true" speaker="Nicole Vincent" start="4867">laughter</p><p end="4928" is_meta="false" speaker="Nicole Vincent" start="4867">The problem is that I -- the problem wasn't that this had any bad effects. The problem was that I felt like an undersaturated sponge. And everyone was expecting that Nicole Vincent, right? And they kept throwing me opportunities, and I kept taking them up. A year-and -a -half after I started this project, my relationship broke up. Seven years downthe gurgler. Now, I -- this is not a story about &#8220;Take m odafinil and your relationships will break up.&#8221; The problem was that I hadn't reassessed what I actually valued. I created a fantastic opportunity for myself to make choices, which would then lead me to sacrifice the very things that I claimed were valuable.</p><p end="4987" is_meta="false" speaker="Nicole Vincent" start="4928">We are not against smart drugs. We are pro choice. We are just trying to get you to figure out, what are the things that are really important?</p></transcript></debate>
