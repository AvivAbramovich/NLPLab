Andrew's a writer who's written very movingly about this issue. He's also a public speaker. And if you look at the talks he's given on TED,</p><p end="476" is_meta="false" speaker="Peter Singer" start="418">TED.com, you will find that eight million people have viewed them, whereas my talk has only been viewed by one million.</p><p end="539" is_meta="false" speaker="Andrew Solomon" start="476">Well, it's somewhat less taboo, but in a society in which people tend to be in denial about the reality of mortality altogether, getting them to talk about this is still frequently a struggle. But I think speaking about it openly, as we are doing tonight, is one way to help people be less afraid to tell their families or to tell their doctors what they actually think and feel.</p><p end="846" is_meta="false" speaker="Andrew Solomon" start="783">Because much of modern medicine prolongs not living but dying, we need to rethink death itself. Making someone die in a way that others approve, but that he feels is anathema, is an odious fo rm of tyranny. Aid-in -dying needs to be tightly regulated, as any life or death matter does, from driving to surgery. But while no one should be pressed into assisted dying, no one should be categorically denied that right. It's about dignity. In hi s dissent in Cruzan, Supreme Court Justice William Brennan said, "An ignoble end steeped in decay is abhorrent.</p><p end="898" is_meta="false" speaker="Andrew Solomon" start="846">A quiet, proud death, bodily integrity intact, is a matter of extreme confidence. &#8221; And it's about reassurance. Brittan y Maynard , who captured headlines for choosing to end her life at the age of 29 at the end of a battle with brain cancer, said, "It has given me peace.</p><p end="898" is_meta="false" speaker="Andrew Solomon" start="846">I do not want to die, but I am dying, and I want to die on my own terms." It's not about depression. When hope of recovery is gone, when one achieves relief from physical symptoms only at the cost of mental clarity, when &#8211; on e&#8217;s dignity is lost to physical deterioration, the wish to end your life may be rational. Now, there are some people who find great meaning in those very final stages.</p><p end="960" is_meta="false" speaker="Andrew Solomon" start="898">But there are other people who are not interested in finding that meaning. And from a non -theological point of view, it can be argued that the meaning people attach to that stage of life is an artifact of the human imagination. It's not about suicide. Suicide responds to personal disintegration while this precludes it. And it is about the limitations of medicine. It's nothing short of medical arrogance to say that palliative care and hospice can adequately deal with the end of every life. Hospice, in fact, can impose an authoritarian, hard, paternalistic view that the hospice way of dying is the only way,</p><p end="960" is_meta="false" speaker="Andrew Solomon" start="898">and it's rooted in precedent, as John said in the opening, in Oregon, where after 17 years, only 752 people have died from lethal prescriptions, which is to say .2 percent of the people in the state who have died.</p><p end="1024" is_meta="false" speaker="Andrew Solomon" start="960">As Hillary once hoped for abortion, this is safe, legal and rar e, and it has popular support. According to a 2013 Gallup Poll, 70 percent of Americans support legalizationof physician assistance in dying. When my mother's friend, Sandy, was dying of cancer,</p><p end="1024" is_meta="false" speaker="Andrew Solomon" start="960">my mother visited and saw her in the hospital where she was screaming in pain and so heavily medicated that she was unable to recognize the other people in the room. And when she came home, my mother said, "If I ever get to that state of pain, promise that one of you will shoot me." M y mother was diagnosed with o varian cancer when she was 56. And when her first chemotherapy failed, she said that she would submit to another round of agonizing treatment only on the condition that someone got her those pill s.</p><p end="1085" is_meta="false" speaker="Andrew Solomon" start="1024">By the time of her third chemo, she was in dilapidated health. She was vomiting. She had a persistent malaise, she had hair loss, she was negotiating surgical adhesions, but she also had the pills. And the agony became unimportant because the symptoms w ere permanent only until she decided that she could take no more, and then she would be free, and so the disease was no longer in control of her. My grieving father, my mother,</p><p end="1085" is_meta="false" speaker="Andrew Solomon" start="1024">my brother and I talked through the logistics as though a dress rehearsal would exhaust some of the pain of the loss in advance. We planned it together, much as we had once planned parties or family vacations or Christmas. We were liberated by our newly clarified emotions, but we were entombed in the loneliness of our illegal collusion.</p><p end="1142" is_meta="false" speaker="Andrew Solomon" start="1085">My mother went to see a gastroenterologist two years after she got sick, who told her that she had significant tumors in her intestines and would soon be unable to digest food. She called my brother and me, and she said that it was time . It was all very much as we had planned it. She said, "The only thing I still fear is this not going smoothly." And she took the antiemetics. A few nights earlier, my mother and my brother had pulled a wishbone, and my mother had won. And now my brot her said to her, "What did you wish for?" And she said, "I wished for this to be over as quickly as possible. And I got my wish, I got my wishes so often." And then she said, "When you were children, I wanted my love to make the world a safe place for y ou.</p><p end="1200" is_meta="false" speaker="Andrew Solomon" start="1142">And my greatest hope is that it will still wrap you up for your whole life." And she said to my father, "I would gladly have given decades of my life to be the one to go first. For 30 years, Howard, you have been my life." And then as her voice slowed with the medication, she said, "I'm sad to be going." But even with this early death, I wouldn't want to change my life for any other life in the world. I have loved completely, and I have been completely loved, and I've had such a good tim e. I've looked for so many things in this life, so many things. And all the time, paradise was in this room with the three of you." I've seen other deaths, and I remember feeling that they belonged to the hospital or the illness or the gun or the catastrophe.</p><p end="1263" is_meta="false" speaker="Andrew Solomon" start="1200">This death was my mother's own. She was the same person in death that she had been in life, and it was her right to choose it over a death like Sandy's, and it should be everyone's right. The words "liberty" and "dignity" are nearly sy nonymous in death as they are in love.</p><p end="1743" is_meta="false" speaker="Peter Singer" start="1677">Thank you. Let's be clear what we are debating this evening. It's "Legalize Assisted Suicide." It's not "Put Utilitarianism into Practice," and it's also not anything further to do with other areas in which one may or may not think that sometimes death is preferable and ought to be provided.</p><p end="1796" is_meta="false" speaker="Peter Singer" start="1743">That is not the topic. You're asked to discuss -- to focus only on this quite narrow question. Now, if you think about that question, we are, of course, influenced by the idea that normally death is a bad thing. We often think of it as the very worst thing that can happen to us. But if we ask ourselves why that should be, "Why is death a bad thing?" then we can think that the re are a variety of reasons in normal circumstances. For instance, people want to go on living, so death is contrary to that very strong wish that people have. It violates their autonomy. If somebody else in particular kills them, it normally violates their autonomy, which is somet hing that we ought to respect. Secondly, death ends your life, and most of us think of life as a positive, as a good thing, fortunately.</p><p end="1858" is_meta="false" speaker="Peter Singer" start="1796">So , it prevents you from continuing to live that life that you find worthwhile, that you find fulfilli ng and rich, that brings you happiness and other values. And, thirdly, death is a bad thing for those who love and care for the person who dies. It's a source of grief to them that someone they love dies. So that's why normally, of course, we should not</p><p end="1858" is_meta="false" speaker="Peter Singer" start="1796">promote death, let alone kill people. But there are very special circumstances in which none of these things apply, and that's what we're talking about tonight. There are circumstances in which the person who is considering death wants to die. That is their autonomous choice. So, death is not a violation of their autonomy, or contrary to their strongest wishes. But it's in accordance with them, as Andrew described in the case of his mother just now.</p><p end="1924" is_meta="false" speaker="Peter Singer" start="1858">Secondly, there are cases in which a person has no more valuable life to look forward to,</p><p end="1924" is_meta="false" speaker="Peter Singer" start="1858">valuable by their judgment, not valuable by somebody else's judgment imposing on them the idea that their life is still worthwhile, even though they, having thought the matter through -- perhaps having t hought it through for many years -- again, as in the case Andrew described, have decided that life would not be worth living for them under some circumstances. And in particular, if they have only a short time to live, as in the case of the statutes in Ore gon and Washington, and now Vermont as well, then they know that they cannot look forward to more years of happiness. And as for the grief that those who love them will feel, of course they will feel that grief if they die now. But in the cases covered by these statutes, where people are terminally ill and likely to die --</p><p end="1924" is_meta="false" speaker="Peter Singer" start="1858">two doctor s certify that they will die, they have less than six months to live, then the family is going to grieve anyway.</p><p end="1985" is_meta="false" speaker="Peter Singer" start="1924">And the caring family -- like Andrew and his brother -- will at least feel that the person they love got to die at a time of their own choosing. And that's important. Now, in fact,</p><p end="1985" is_meta="false" speaker="Peter Singer" start="1924">this idea that this is sometimes a good thing is recognized by our opponents. Daniel Sulmasy just said that sometimes it's justifiable to relieve patients' pain, if you're hastening death. It's not the hastening death that they object to, because they acknowledge that you can withdraw treatment that would keep patients alive --</p><p end="1985" is_meta="false" speaker="Peter Singer" start="1924">s ometimes would keep patients alive for a long time. It's the intention of ending a patient's life that they object to. But we don't have to accept that morality. That's a specific morality which Daniel Sulmasy is free to hold, of course. And if he -- as he said at the beginning -- would not like you -- to help you end your life, that's entirely up to him.</p><p end="1985" is_meta="false" speaker="Peter Singer" start="1924">Nobody is suggesting he should be compelled to end anyone's life against his conscience.</p><p end="2041" is_meta="false" speaker="Peter Singer" start="1985">But if a different doctor -- and there are such doct ors -- is willing to do that, indeed,</p><p end="2041" is_meta="false" speaker="Peter Singer" start="1985">thinks that that's the best final care that he can give to a patient who he can no longer restore to a situation that the patient considers worthwhile, then I don't -- I don't think we should be hung up by this idea that something is somehow always a wrongful intention, even if in normal circumstances, to aim at someone's death would be a wrongful intention. But not in these circumstances. In these circumstances, it may be the right intention. Now, I'm sure we're going to hear from probably Ilora Finlay, I guess,</p><p end="2041" is_meta="false" speaker="Peter Singer" start="1985">that there are risks &#8211; that this is a dangerous thing -- that it will lead to a slippery slope.</p><p end="2041" is_meta="false" speaker="Peter Singer" start="1985">That argument has been around in this debate for a long time. I think that when I fir st became interested in this question -- which now goes back about 40 years.</p><p end="2099" is_meta="false" speaker="Peter Singer" start="2041">T hat that was an argument that you had to treat very seriously and had to give a lot of weight to. And I could not be completely sure that it was not justified. But no w we have much more experience of the legalization of assisted suicide. We have, in the Netherlands -- in fact, more than 30 years' experience of the open practice of -- by the medical profession, with the support of the Royal Dutch Medical Society -- not against the doctors' views -- of that practice. And with its full legalization, about 14 -- about 12 years ago. And fully supported by the Dutch population, so that although there's been a succession of governments -- some conservative, some more liberal, one of them under a Roman Catholic prime minister -- they have not ever sought to repeal the legislation.</p><p end="2099" is_meta="false" speaker="Peter Singer" start="2041">And similarly, in Oregon, we now have 17 years of experience, a relatively small number of people dying each year.</p><p end="2160" is_meta="false" speaker="Peter Singer" start="2099">And as you heard, more of them requesting the prescriptions, but not using them,</p><p end="2160" is_meta="false" speaker="Peter Singer" start="2099">because they want the control. They want to know that they could end their life if they want to. So, with that experience, the experience of Belgium as well, which followed the Netherlands, its neighbor, and then Luxembourg, and then also Washington -- the state of Washington, the neighbor of Oregon, which was watching what was going on there,</p><p end="2160" is_meta="false" speaker="Peter Singer" start="2099">and decided that was a good system that they wanted, and therefore accepte d it -- we have not seen a slippery slope here. We have, in fact, found that these -- this legalization is something endorsed by the populations concerned and supported by it,</p><p end="2160" is_meta="false" speaker="Peter Singer" start="2099">and they want it to continue. Thank you.</p><p end="2759" is_meta="false" speaker="Andrew Solomon" start="2701">Well, I think that actually we send a very dark message to the society at large when we say to people that they don't have the right to make these decisions, when we say to peo ple that we look at their suffering and their anguish, and we refuse to help or support them. I think that sends a social message. I think people have a difficult timespeaking openly and directly to doctors if they know that what they are discussing is illegal, and they don't know what their doctor's legal or ethical position on it is going to be.</p><p end="2816" is_meta="false" speaker="Andrew Solomon" start="2759">I think that a shift of this kind always has a range of social consequences, so I cannot say that they don't exist at all, but I would say that to me they are vastly outweighed by the benefits that are gained.</p><p end="2877" is_meta="false" speaker="Peter Singer" start="2816">Look, I do disagree with it. I mean, there's a sense in which none of us is an island and every act could be seen as having some ramifications socially. But this one is one that I think has very few. And I don't think that the implication that if you end your life somehow you've left a skeleton in the closet, that seems nonsense to me.</p><p end="2943" is_meta="false" speaker="Peter Singer" start="2877">And, after all, you're making a decision, why wouldn't you say the same to the patient who says, "I don't want any more treatment"? You know, you sa y patients have the right to refuse treatment, you say that Andrew's mother didn't need to have the chemotherapy, but, you know, why wouldn't you say -- why couldn't the doctor say,</p><p end="2943" is_meta="false" speaker="Peter Singer" start="2877">"Look, this could keep you alive, maybe even you'll live for ano ther 23 years, who knows?" like David? You know, you can't exclude it, but you're quite happy to say to people, "You can refuse treatment, you can withdraw burdensome treatment of va rious kinds -- the doctor can do that, you don't have to accept it," so I don't see really there's such a big difference in terms of the ramifications here of , in both cases , a patient's decision not to do what will prolong their life.</p><p end="3000" is_meta="false" speaker="Peter Singer" start="2943">But why doesn't that apply to a decision to withdraws a ventilator.</p><p end="3064" is_meta="false" speaker="Peter Singer" start="3000">I mean, have you never seen a patient where a doctor said, "I think we should take the ventilator away," and the patient actually lived quite a lot longer?</p><p end="3300" is_meta="false" speaker="Peter Singer" start="3240">Look, as Andrew said, you can't say that it will never happen. But is it right to condemn a vastly larger number of people to suffer when they don &#8217;t want to because there may,</p><p end="3300" is_meta="false" speaker="Peter Singer" start="3240">you know, in one in several thousand cases, perhaps, be somebody like the David and</p><p end="3300" is_meta="false" speaker="Peter Singer" start="3240">Ilora Finlay described? I don't think so. And I would, again, emphasize, I think the case that Daniel Sulmasy just brought up, with Karen Quinlan, precisely shows that they are making decisions when they withdraw treatment. She lived another nine years. She never recovered consciousness and she died without recovering consciousness. In my view, that was pretty pointless. But if you believe in intrinsic worth of human life, you shouldn't have seen the ventilator as futile, because the ventilator kept her al ive -- was thought to be keeping her alive. And after it was removed, the feeding tubes were keeping her alive. So, was that a good thing? I mean, I don't think it was a good thing, I have to say.</p><p end="3357" is_meta="false" speaker="Peter Singer" start="3300">But it certainly shows that the decision about withdrawing treatment is just as much a decision that you can get wrong, and you can be dramatically shortening someone's life,</p><p end="3357" is_meta="false" speaker="Peter Singer" start="3300">as the decision that we're talking about.</p><p end="3357" is_meta="false" speaker="Andrew Solomon" start="3300">And let me just add that I have interviewed hundreds of people and he ard stories of thousands more who wanted the option to be able to end their lives. And because they had to deal with the system in which what they were doing was illegal, they felt they had to do it while they still had enough vitality and enough self- control to take the lethal medications that they had been able to obtain. And they, over and over and over and over again, die months or sometimes years earlier than they would otherwise be going to die because they're afraid that they will lose that capacity. And my own mother said she could have lived longer if she hadn't been afraid that those intestinal tumors would make it im possible for her to ingest her --</p><p end="3420" is_meta="false" speaker="Andrew Solomon" start="3357">I'm arguing no such thing. My question is whether --</p><p end="3420" is_meta="false" speaker="Andrew Solomon" start="3357">-- the doctor is injecting you. It's a question of whether you'll get into a hospital within which you will not be able to exercise your own volition anymore, because the hospice system can be so controlling and you are so tightly monitored that you lose the capacity to take those drugs.</p><p end="3478" is_meta="false" speaker="Andrew Solomon" start="3420">Ilora Finlay:Well, why would you have to kill yourself , because you've got a failure with your healthcare system? I would suggest you need to rectify your healthcare system so people can make choices and control.</p><p end="3478" is_meta="true" speaker="Andrew Solomon" start="3420">applause</p><p end="3478" is_meta="false" speaker="Andrew Solomon" start="3420">Excuse me, but the only way to rectify that aspect of the healthcare system would be to give people the capacity to take those drugs under supervision of the healthcare system,</p><p end="3478" is_meta="false" speaker="Andrew Solomon" start="3420">which is precisely what you are opposing.</p><p end="3478" is_meta="true" speaker="Andrew Solomon" start="3420">applause</p><p end="3658" is_meta="false" speaker="Peter Singer" start="3596">Yeah, I take it that Ilora Finlay is not denying that in the UK there are re quests for physician -assisted suicide and that indeed there is a movement because you know very well that there is a bill in your own House, the House of Lords, which seemed to make some progress just the other day. And it's also true that there are Briti sh subjects who have traveled from Britain to Switzerland in order to end their life because Switzerland allows nonresidents, unusually, to have assisted suicide, physician -assisted suicide. So</p><p end="3658" is_meta="false" speaker="Peter Singer" start="3596">it's clearly the case that it's not just the U.S. syste m although, you know, I wish we could just snap our fingers and then we would ha ve a wonderful U.S. health system in which nobody needed to end their life. But it's not an easy task, as President Obama found out, to reform the U.S. healthcare system. S o unfortunately, we're going to have to live and die with the system that we have. But I can't really imagine a system in which -- you know, in the foreseeable future in which there are no serious considered requests for physician -assisted suic ide.</p><p end="3840" is_meta="false" speaker="Andrew Solomon" start="3783">Well, that's actually been studied in the context of Oregon. They've looked at the families of people who have had physician aid in dying and compared them on various psychological measures with families of people who died of natural causes. And what they found is that there is no difference at all except that the people who had relatives who went through physician aid in dying by and large ha ve a greater acceptance of what has happened and have a grieving process in which they feel there is more coherence.</p><p end="3840" is_meta="false" speaker="Andrew Solomon" start="3783">That's what the statistics in Oregon have shown.</p><p end="3899" is_meta="false" speaker="Andrew Solomon" start="3840">Well, I think it's terribly important that people have a psychological assessment. When we proposed this, what we proposed is a highly regulated system. And we have many highly regulated systems. In fact, we have a highly regulated syste m for making a decision to discontinue life support. We already have a system for people who don't want to go on living and who have a serious illness.</p><p end="3959" is_meta="false" speaker="Andrew Solomon" start="3899">That system in which people have to be shown to be competent, in which they have to be as sessed not to be suffering from a psychiatric illness, in which, if there is any evidence that they might be, they have to undergo treatment before it's determined whether their decision is a fully rational decision is an appropriate set of measures. But we set regulations like that everywhere. I mean, 92 people a day die in traffic accidents in the United States. We don't say, because people are dying in traffic accidents, we should make cars illegal. We say people shouldn't drive over a certain speed limit. They should pay attention to traffic lights. We set a regulatory system in place. And none of us are arguing in favor of an unregulated activity, and none of us are arguing in favor of helping people to die who have got a depression that could be calls to resolve.</p><p end="4021" is_meta="false" speaker="Peter Singer" start="3959">But we are not wedded to the Oregon system or the Vermont system without saying that it could be improved. I know that your House of Lords just accepted an amendment that there should be judicial review of doctors' decisions. We are certainly welcome to consider those possibilities. We are simply saying that there is a legal system of regulating assisted suicide which is worth implementing.</p><p end="4264" is_meta="false" speaker="Peter Singer" start="4208">No, that was just not true, sorry. There was never a case when physician assisted suicide --</p><p end="4264" is_meta="false" speaker="Peter Singer" start="4208">-- was legal or accepted and euthanasia was not. But that's --</p><p end="4264" is_meta="false" speaker="Peter Singer" start="4208">-- [inaudible] they just didn't see that distinction.</p><p end="4264" is_meta="false" speaker="Peter Singer" start="4208">Ilora Finlay:-- they didn't see that distinction, but they're now using euthanasia more , and also the --</p><p end="4264" is_meta="false" speaker="Peter Singer" start="4208">complications that arose with physician -assisted suicide, because of vomiting, and nausea, and so on.</p><p end="4317" is_meta="false" speaker="Peter Singer" start="4264">They've gone over to injec ting drugs in --</p><p end="4621" is_meta="false" speaker="Peter Singer" start="4564">I find it a very sad story, actually, that that was so important to that woman, that sense of being a woman.</p><p end="4682" is_meta="false" speaker="Peter Singer" start="4621">But --</p><p end="4682" is_meta="true" speaker="Peter Singer" start="4621">a pplause</p><p end="4682" is_meta="false" speaker="Peter Singer" start="4621">Okay. But -- and I think in a way it's trivializing the reasons why people ask for physician assistance i n dying. It's things like being nauseous, feeling breathless, being -- just being able to lie there and not being able to do anything. I mean, it may be that pain can generally be controlled, or I've certainly read palliative care specialists who acknowledge that it can in every case, except as Daniel Sulmasy just said, by making the patient unconscious. But, you know, that then is getting, I think, very close to what we're talking about. I've seen surveys that say that the majority of American intensive care specialists have u sed terminal sedation, that is they sedate the patient to the point of unconsciousness.</p><p end="4741" is_meta="false" speaker="Peter Singer" start="4682">The patient, of course, then does not eat, and they don't tube feed the person, so the patient then dies. I mean, what's the difference between giving the patient so many drugs that they're unconscious and then they're not fed and they die, or allowing them to take a drug which, at their choice and at their time, will end their life?</p><p end="4741" is_meta="false" speaker="Andrew Solomon" start="4682">And I would just add that --</p><p end="4741" is_meta="false" speaker="Andrew Solomon" start="4682">I will quickly. First to say that I t hink we're all agreed that compassionate medical care is to the good and that anyone who can find meaning in life or can be helped to find meaning in life should be encouraged to do so and receive every possible support.</p><p end="4807" is_meta="false" speaker="Andrew Solomon" start="4741">But I --</p><p end="4807" is_meta="true" speaker="Andrew Solomon" start="4741">a pplause</p><p end="4975" is_meta="false" speaker="Peter Singer" start="4922">No, I don't think we're asking them to risk their integrity --</p><p end="4975" is_meta="false" speaker="Peter Singer" start="4922">-- we're asking them to act with integrity, to consider carefully whether the circumstances are the ones that are prescribed in the law, as we said, could be -- have various kinds of safeguards and reviews, and will minimize those kinds of mistakes. It is true that physicians, like everyone else, are fallible, and it is true that occasionally there may be a mistake, and it may be that somebody could have lived longer and even found their life worthwhile. We're not saying that that can never happen, because we know that in all human things, things could askew occasionally.</p><p end="5037" is_meta="false" speaker="Peter Singer" start="4975">But we don't think these rare possible cases are sufficient t o say that nobody else can have these choice, nobody else can make this decision that "I've had enough," and that because of these very occasional mistakes, everybody else has to suffer through to the end whether they want to do that or not.</p><p end="5277" is_meta="false" speaker="Peter Singer" start="5225">That's not the question. You both evaded the question. The question asked you to accept --</p><p end="5277" is_meta="false" speaker="Peter Singer" start="5225">-- the hypothesis that you can't relieve the excruciating pain. It's an attempt to understand your underlying philosophical or ethical position. And neither of you --</p><p end="5277" is_meta="false" speaker="Peter Singer" start="5225">you've both just evaded that question.</p><p end="5342" is_meta="false" speaker="Peter Singer" start="5277">Thank you.</p><p end="5342" is_meta="false" speaker="Peter Singer" start="5277">It's easier.</p><p end="5403" is_meta="false" speaker="Peter Singer" start="5342">We want you to support this motion because, firstly, we believe that people should be the ones to decide for themselves whether they think that continued life is worthwhile for them or not. We don't think that it should be up to anybody else to say, "We think your life is worthwhile." And, secondly, we think that there is a lot of unnecessarysuffering, whether it's excruciating pain or not, there is suffering and distress of various sorts which continues and is going to continue for the foreseeable future in this system and it could be re lieved by a relatively simple legi slative reform that exists already and has been shown to work. Now, in fact, this region today took a little step closer to that. You may not know that the New Jersey State Assembly today voted to pass the Aid in Dying for the Terminally Ill Act which is similar to the other legislation that we've been discussing.</p><p end="5459" is_meta="true" speaker="Peter Singer" start="5403">applause</p><p end="5459" is_meta="false" speaker="Peter Singer" start="5403">It voted 41 to 31, so a fairly clear majority. It still, of course, has to go to the Senate, and then it would need the assent of a candidate -- a governor who wishes to be the Republican candidate for the presidency --</p><p end="5459" is_meta="true" speaker="Peter Singer" start="5403">laughter</p><p end="5459" is_meta="false" speaker="Peter Singer" start="5403">-- so it still has some way to go. But I just want to quote one of the supporters of that whose name is Janet Colbert. She's a retired oncolo gy nurse, so she knows a lot about cancer and about people dying from cancer. She now herself has terminal liver cancer,</p><p end="5459" is_meta="false" speaker="Peter Singer" start="5403">but she supports this because she said, "As I battle my illness I would like the choice and comfort that comes with the option of aid in dying." That's all we're asking for. Thank you.</p><p end="5638" is_meta="false" speaker="Andrew Solomon" start="5583">I take exception to the idea that all pain is treatable. It's not true to clinical data and it's not true to personal experience. And I also take exception to the idea that we value life by insisting that somebody -- to borrow your phrase "not become a nobody." That can be care, but it can also be oppressive. Rilke wrote, "We need, in love, to practice only this: letting each other go, for holding on comes naturally. We do not need to learn it. &#8221;</p><p end="5638" is_meta="false" speaker="Andrew Solomon" start="5583">Death is not only the start of nothing, but also the end of everything. And it's important that it keeps faith with the way that someone has lived. Nothing so resembles a person in his biography, as the manner of his or her death.</p><p end="5698" is_meta="false" speaker="Andrew Solomon" start="5638">The finale is wh at makes sense of the symphony. Simone de Beauvoir's mother begged her for help when she was sick, and Simone de Beauvoir instead took the word of her doctors. And afterwards, she wrote, "Beaten by the ethics of society, I had abjured my own. &#8221; One is caught up in the wheels and dragged along, powerless in the face of specialist diagnoses that forecast their decisions. A race had begun between death andtorture. I asked myself how one manages to go on living when someone you love has called out to you in vain? Let us not treat those we love with that pusillanimous disregard. Let us not institutionalize and enshrine in law prohibitions that force us to suffer contrary to our beliefs and force us to watch those we love suffer c ontrary to their expressed wishes.</p></transcript></debate>
