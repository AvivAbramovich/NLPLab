They wait for me to move them. They wait for me to feed them and water them and take care of them. And I love serving them.

And -- and it's a distinct pleasure and privilege to be able to serve them and make them happy every day.</p><p end="43900" is_meta="false" speaker="M.D. Neal Barnard" start="43831">Thank you. Gene will be talking about the ethical and environmental issues. I'm going to talk about health. In 2009, the Archives of Internal Medicine published a massive research study. The NIH-AARP study had a half a million participants. They were followed for 10 years. Some of them didn't eat meat or didn't eat very much. Some ate quite a lot of meat. And what they showed was that among those eating the most meat, the risk of dying of cancer was increased by fully 20 percent and heart disease deaths were increased by 27 percent among men and 50 percent among women.</p><p end="43953" is_meta="false" speaker="M.D. Neal Barnard" start="43900">And in 2012, the Archives of Internal Medicine published another study. One hundred and twenty thousand people. This was coordinated all at Harvard University. And itshowed exactly the same thing: if you ate a lot of meat, your risk of dying of heart disease was much higher; your risk of dying of cancer was higher. And studies have clearly shown that people who don't eat meat cut their cancer risk by anywhere between 12 and 40 percent. Well, why would meat be linked to cancer? Hold that thought for a second. I grew up in Fargo, North Dakota, and I come from a long line of cattle ranchers. My dad raised cattle, my grandpa raised cattle, as far back as I can trace. Now, my dad did not like the cattle business. He objected to it a great deal. He went to medical school. He spent his life treating diabetes in Fargo, North Dakota. But we still ate like we were in the cattle business.</p><p end="44012" is_meta="false" speaker="M.D. Neal Barnard" start="43953">Every day it was roast beef, baked potatoes, and corn, except for special occasions when it was roast beef, baked potatoes, and peas.</p><p end="44012" is_meta="true" speaker="M.D. Neal Barnard" start="43953">laughter</p><p end="44012" is_meta="false" speaker="M.D. Neal Barnard" start="43953">And my grandfather had a heart attack, and he then became quite severely demented,</p><p end="44012" is_meta="false" speaker="M.D. Neal Barnard" start="43953">and he died. And we took that as normal because he was old. He was 65. My other three grandparents lived longer, but each one of them succumbed to severe dementia year after year after year, and they all finally died. And none of us thought that maybe food had something to do with this. Now, I got my first wake-up call at Fairview Hospital in Minneapolis, where I was the autopsy assistant. One day a man died in a hospital of a massive heart attack, probably from eating hospital food, but that's another story.</p><p end="44012" is_meta="true" speaker="M.D. Neal Barnard" start="43953">laughter</p><p end="44012" is_meta="false" speaker="M.D. Neal Barnard" start="43953">And the pathologist came in the room, and he knew that I was headed for medical school. So he removed a section of ribs, and he sliced open one of the coronary arteries, and he said, "Look inside."</p><p end="44074" is_meta="false" speaker="M.D. Neal Barnard" start="44012">And it looked like chewing gum in this coronary artery, but when I felt it, it was hard like a rock. And he said, "That's atherosclerosis. That's your morning sausage, Neal. That's your bacon, Neal. That's your roast beef in there." And he said, "We see the beginnings of this in three quarters of people by age 23," which happened to be the age I was at the time. And he wrote up all his findings. He left the room. And I had to clean up. I took the ribs. I put them back in the chest. I tried to make them fit with the other ribs. And I sewed up the skin, cleaned up, and I went up to the cafeteria, where they were serving ribs for lunch.[laughter]</p><p end="44074" is_meta="false" speaker="M.D. Neal Barnard" start="44012">Now, fast forwarding a little bit, a little -- a few years later Dr. Dean Ornish brought in to a research study people who had atherosclerosis, they had narrowed arteries, he took the meat out of their diets, and something happened that had never been shown before. The arteries actually started opening up again, so much that you could see a measurable difference in 82 percent of patients in the first year with no surgery and no medications.</p><p end="44135" is_meta="false" speaker="M.D. Neal Barnard" start="44074">Grass-fed beef does not do that, including the beef my family raised. It just doesn't work. Eating chicken and eating fish just can't do that. And so my research team tried this same kind of diet for people who wanted to lose weight, and NIH funded us to try this kind of diet for people who had diabetes. And it works better than any other diet.</p><p end="44135" is_meta="false" speaker="M.D. Neal Barnard" start="44074">Why? Because when you get meat out of the diet, meat has fat in it and every gram of fat has nine calories. That's its job. You get it out of the diet, and you get rid of a lot of calories. Meat has zero fiber, none. Fiber fills you up without calories, and if the foods you have don&#8217;t have it, you&#8217;re going to eat too much, and you&#8217;re going to gain weight.</p><p end="44135" is_meta="false" speaker="M.D. Neal Barnard" start="44074">Why diabetes? Because getting the meat out of the diet helps fat to drain out of the muscle cells, allowing insulin to start working on its own.</p><p end="44135" is_meta="false" speaker="M.D. Neal Barnard" start="44074">And we saw something I never saw in medical school, which is diabetes improving,</p><p end="44135" is_meta="false" speaker="M.D. Neal Barnard" start="44074">sometimes even disappearing for all intents and purposes.</p><p end="44195" is_meta="false" speaker="M.D. Neal Barnard" start="44135">And when we look at broad population studies, the meat-eaters are always the heaviest group, and the people who eat no meat are always the thinnest. Diabetes is the same way. =t&#8217;s about 8 percent of adult meat-eaters, and among vegetarians, 3 percent. High blood pressure, exactly the same. You just don&#8217;t see it very much in people following vegetarian diets. But why more cancer? Well, when we heat up meat, something happens that doesn&#8217;t happen with plant foods, and that&#8217;s that carcinogens called heterocyclic amines form in the meat, especially chicken, but any kind of skeletal muscle, which is what meat is. But that&#8217;s not the only carcinogen. We also see polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, there&#8217;s heme iron, there are a lot of things. Plus meat doesn&#8217;t have fiber that protects you. =t doesn&#8217;t have any vitamin C. It&#8217;s low in important antioxidants.</p><p end="44195" is_meta="false" speaker="M.D. Neal Barnard" start="44135">So it&#8217;s like tobacco. We know for sure tobacco causes lung cancer, but we&#8217;re not 100 percent sure which part of the tobacco smoke is responsible.</p><p end="44257" is_meta="false" speaker="M.D. Neal Barnard" start="44195">We know clearly that meat causes cancer in other parts of your body. The stomach, the intestinal tract -- but we&#8217;re not sure. =s it the :CAs? The PA:s? We&#8217;re not quite sure yet.</p><p end="44257" is_meta="false" speaker="M.D. Neal Barnard" start="44195">I asked Dr. Richard Leakey, the famous paleoanthropologist, how did we get into meat-</p><p end="44257" is_meta="false" speaker="M.D. Neal Barnard" start="44195">eating? And he said humans are naturally primates. We&#8217;re great apes. We are not carnivores, and we ate things we could pick with our hands, until the Stone Age gave us stone tools, and meat-eating began, he believes, as scavenging. Lying with leafs and bones, we would scrape it up with these stone tools that we now had. Problem: we have pre-Stone Age bodies that get cancer and get heart disease when you eat meat. Of course, if your life expectancy is 35 or 40, it doesn&#8217;t matter, but if you live to a mid-age and beyond, then these things matter a lot. And what matters now is Alzheimer&#8217;s disease. We have now learned that a diet high in saturated fat -- that&#8217;s the bad fat in meat -- is linked to Alzheimer&#8217;s disease in studies in Chicago, in New York, in Finland.</p><p end="44319" is_meta="false" speaker="M.D. Neal Barnard" start="44257">And meat-eaters actually have very poor nutrition. Yes, they get protein, but they don&#8217;t get many vitamins, they don&#8217;t get any complex carbohydrates, they&#8217;re missing fiber. A vegetarian diet gives you all the protein you&#8217;re going to need, plus many more vitamins,</p><p end="44319" is_meta="false" speaker="M.D. Neal Barnard" start="44257">many more minerals. So Bill Clinton did. Al Gore did it. Bob Barker did it. Serena Williams did it. Since 2004 meat-eating has dropped by 9 percent. That&#8217;s where we&#8217;re going. That&#8217;s the future. Thank you very much.</p><p end="44319" is_meta="true" speaker="M.D. Neal Barnard" start="44257">applause</p><p end="44319" is_meta="false" speaker="Chris Masterjohn" start="44257">First, thank you to everyone involved tonight for providing us with an opportunity to debate this issue in such an excellent forum.</p><p end="44373" is_meta="false" speaker="Chris Masterjohn" start="44319">And John, every time that I buy meat, I always think about the conditions the cow was raised in. Tonight my partner Joel Salatin and I will urge you to vote against the motion,</p><p end="44373" is_meta="false" speaker="Chris Masterjohn" start="44319">"Don&#8217;t Eat Anything with a Face." =&#8217;d like to begin by telling you a personal story. When I was 18, I became a vegetarian, because I believed that this would be the most healthful, ethical, and ecologically conscious dietary choice I could make. Six monthslater I became a vegan, meaning I excluded all animal products from my diet. After all, I had to follow the inevitable conclusion of my own logic. All animals die regardless of whether we kill them, and what I opposed most strongly was the cruelty and abuse seen in the industrial factory farm, which is often worse for laying hens and dairy cows than it is for animals raised for meat. =&#8217;m sure that my opponent, Gene, will explain some of this abuse to you later tonight.</p><p end="44431" is_meta="false" speaker="Chris Masterjohn" start="44373">A year and a half down the road, it became clearer and clearer that my dietary journey through vegetarianism and veganism was failing to bring me into any promised land of vibrant health. Many pre-existing health problems, that had mostly been a nuisance to me in the past, devolved into burdens that crippled my day-to-day function. My digestion worsened, my energy tanked, and my irritability skyrocketed. Intense exercise began giving my anxiety and heart palpitations. In a single dental examination, I found out that I had over a dozen cavities and needed two root canals. Worst of all, my anxiety disorders aggravated to the point that I had several panic attacks per week and was often afraid to eat my own food or even begin driving my own car.</p><p end="44431" is_meta="false" speaker="Chris Masterjohn" start="44373">But then I encountered the work of Weston Price, which really changed my life. Weston Price was the first research director for what became the American Dental Association and was a pioneer in nutritional and medical anthropology.</p><p end="44494" is_meta="false" speaker="Chris Masterjohn" start="44431">He documented -- all over the globe, in different climates, in different altitudes and latitudes, in groups with radically different cultural and genetic backgrounds -- the consistent effects of the nutritional transition from traditional diets to what he called the &#8220;displacing foods of modern commerce&#8221;: white flower, white sugar, white rice,</p><p end="44494" is_meta="false" speaker="Chris Masterjohn" start="44431">vegetable oils, and canned goods. In every case, the transition was one from radiant and vibrant health to not only tooth decay and dental deformities, but often to tuberculosis, cancer, ulcers, appendicitis, cystitis, gallbladder disease, physical degeneration of all kinds. All of the groups that successfully maintained vibrant health on their traditional diets placed special emphasis on the need for animal products rich in fat-soluble vitamins. Some groups emphasized dairy products, others emphasized organ meats and egg yolks, others the animal life of the sea, and yet others small animals and insects. Price went on to provide laboratory and clinical evidence that the emphasis on these foods was in fact a critical reason for the success of these traditional diets.</p><p end="44553" is_meta="false" speaker="Chris Masterjohn" start="44494">After reading Price's work, I began emphasizing high-quality, nutrient-dense animal foods in my own diet, and within months my anxiety disorders completely disappeared,and my tooth decay came to a crashing halt. I truly felt like a new person. Indeed, my mental and physical health had undergone a revolution.</p><p end="44553" is_meta="false" speaker="Chris Masterjohn" start="44494">My experience raises two questions: First, am I alone in it? And second, what happened to me and why? The scientific literature shows that I'm not alone. Seven out of eight relevant studies found that compared to omnivores, vegetarians have a greater risk of mental disorders, including eating disorders, depression, poor self-esteem,</p><p end="44553" is_meta="false" speaker="Chris Masterjohn" start="44494">anxiety, and contemplated or attempted suicide. A study published in 2010 found that compared to omnivores, vegans had eight times more lesions involving poor mineralization of the teeth. Why might this be? Well, simply put, many nutrients are much easier to get from animal products than from plant products. Perhaps the most underappreciated of these is cholesterol. Many people are aware that high cholesterol is associated with heart disease.</p><p end="44616" is_meta="false" speaker="Chris Masterjohn" start="44553">But few people are aware that low cholesterol is associated with mental disorders,</p><p end="44616" is_meta="false" speaker="Chris Masterjohn" start="44553">violent and self-injurious behavior, hemorrhagic stroke, cancer, and increased total mortality. Dr. Barnard himself has published scientific papers showing that, although his diet leads to increased intakes of many nutrients, primarily from fruits and vegetables, it also leads to decreased intakes of vitamin B12, vitamin D, and selenium, and fails to guarantee an adequate intake of zinc. Dr. Barnard recommends supplementing with vitamin B12 and vitamin D and emphasizing vegan foods rich in zinc, but the foods richest in zinc aren't vegan at all. They're oysters, beef, and cheese. It is unlikely that supplementing our way out of these nutrient deficiencies, moreover, will be a complete success, because all of these nutrients have very complex interactions with the other components present in the foods in which we find them. Vitamin B12, for example,</p><p end="44616" is_meta="false" speaker="Chris Masterjohn" start="44553">synergizes with key amino acids found most abundantly in meat, bones, and skin. Is it possible to design an adequate diet that does not include the meat of animals with faces?</p><p end="44675" is_meta="false" speaker="Chris Masterjohn" start="44616">I actually think that it is. It would include egg yolks, dairy products and shellfish.</p><p end="44675" is_meta="false" speaker="Chris Masterjohn" start="44616">Shellfish are neither vegan nor vegetarian, after all; they're animals. But many people might argue, perhaps correctly, that they don't have faces. Such a diet, however, would not be adequate for everyone. Let me provide, by way of example for now, just one reason why: Vitamin A. Vitamin A is found most abundantly in liver and cod liver oil or the liver oils of other fishes, while more moderate amounts are found in egg yolks and butter fat. Red, orange, yellow and green vegetables provide carotenoids such as beta-</p><p end="44675" is_meta="false" speaker="Chris Masterjohn" start="44616">carotene which we can convert into vitamin A. However, the efficiency of this conversion is relatively poor and highly variable. Half of people with European ancestry have a genetic variant that cuts their ability to make the conversion in half, and a third,</p><p end="44675" is_meta="false" speaker="Chris Masterjohn" start="44616">other variant that cuts it fourfold. These people are extremely unlikely to get enoughvitamin A from plant foods alone and would do best if they included liver or cod liver oil in their diet which are derived from animals with faces.</p><p end="44735" is_meta="false" speaker="Chris Masterjohn" start="44675">In order to construct an optimal dietary approach that is robust to error and adaptable to individual needs, we need to abandon the false dichotomy between healthy plant foods and supposedly unhealthy animal foods, and instead embrace the health value of high-quality, nutrient-dense foods of all types. Fortunately, animal foods are highest in quality and richest in nutrients when the animals are raised in an ethical and ecologically conscious manner, with high-quality soil, out on pasture in the fresh air and sunshine.</p><p end="44735" is_meta="false" speaker="Chris Masterjohn" start="44675">My partner Joel Salatin will explain more about how this is done and will conclude our opening argument for why you should vote against this motion.</p><p end="44735" is_meta="true" speaker="Chris Masterjohn" start="44675">applause</p><p end="44798" is_meta="false" speaker="Gene Baur" start="44735">Thank you very much, and thank you for this opportunity. It's wonderful to be discussing this issue. Most people don't think enough about our food choices and about the animals who suffer terribly for the meat, milk and eggs that is produced in this country. I grew up eating animals without really thinking about it. My parents ate animals, my brothers and sisters ate animals. Everybody around me was doing it, so I just adopted the habit, without really thinking about it. But as I started learning about the fact of how these animals were treated and about the fact that I could live well without eating animals, I made the choice to become a vegan. I did that back in 1985.It's one of the best choices I've ever made. And the fact that we can live well without eating other animals, without causing harm, I think is the key question here, the key point.</p><p end="44851" is_meta="false" speaker="Gene Baur" start="44798">If we can live well without causing harm, why wouldn't we do it? And the main reason is that we just sort of grow up doing it, without thinking about it. So, the question is, how can we live well? How do we want to feel when we treat other animals the way we treat them? And on these factory farms, they're treated horribly. I visited farms across the country. I've seen animals put in these small cages where they can't move. You walk into these farms, and you're hit with this horrible stench. They're living in their feces. They're screaming to get out of their cages, and they live that way their whole lives, and then they're killed young so that we can eat them. And, you know, when people see this, they don't like it. And oftentimes people say, "Don't tell me. I don't want to know," when the issue of factory farming comes up, because it is so upsetting and because we are compassionate, and because we are hardwired to have empathy.</p><p end="44913" is_meta="false" speaker="Gene Baur" start="44851">When we look at other animals, and we see them suffer, when we look at other people,</p><p end="44913" is_meta="false" speaker="Gene Baur" start="44851">and we see them suffer, we feel something. That is one of the best parts of our humanity, this empathy, this ability to feel something when we look into somebody else's face. When the executioners at the Salem witch hunts were charged with killing witches, they were told, &#8220;Don't look into their face, because if you do, they'll cast a spell on you, and you won't be able to kill them.&#8221; Basically, when you look into their face,</p><p end="44913" is_meta="false" speaker="Gene Baur" start="44851">there's empathy, there's a connection, there's an understanding that there's a living creature there. And when you abuse another animal or another person for that matter,</p><p end="44913" is_meta="false" speaker="Gene Baur" start="44851">there's this tendency to try to denigrate them and to say, well, they don't really have feelings. They don't really deserve any better. And that's unfortunately what has happened to farm animals. There are these misconceptions and incorrect ideas about animals on farms not being smart. For instance, people think turkeys are so dumb they'll go outside and they'll drown in the rain. This is one of these myths that people say, probably to feel better about mistreating animals.</p><p end="44973" is_meta="false" speaker="Gene Baur" start="44913">But we've raised turkeys at Farm Sanctuary for many years. They go outside. They've never gone out and drowned in the rain.</p><p end="44973" is_meta="true" speaker="Gene Baur" start="44913">laughter</p><p end="44973" is_meta="false" speaker="Gene Baur" start="44913">They enjoy, you know, going indoors and outdoors. And when the animals come to us,</p><p end="44973" is_meta="false" speaker="Gene Baur" start="44913">they're often afraid because they've only known cruelty. But when they startrecognizing they're in a safe place, and they start being treated with kindness, they respond. And it's a beautiful thing to see. We had a turkey at our farm in California we used to call Lydia the Hugging Turkey, because you'd go out into the barnyard and kneel down, and she would come up to you, and she would crane her neck around your neck like she was giving you a hug. So these animal show companionship and friendship.</p><p end="44973" is_meta="false" speaker="Gene Baur" start="44913">And I'm not the only one that has seen this. People who visit Farm Sanctuary and work there have seen this. Jane Goodall, also, is now speaking out about the fact that these animals have feelings and much more intellectual and emotional depth than we ever knew before. She said, "Farm animals feel pleasure and sadness, excitement and resentment, depression, fear and pain.</p><p end="45036" is_meta="false" speaker="Gene Baur" start="44973">They are far more aware and intelligent than we ever imagined. They are individuals in their own right." Now, on factory farms, these animals are treated horribly. I think there is widespread support among this panel even among those who think that it's okay to eat animals, that factory farming is an abomination, that it should not occur. It is outside the bounds of acceptable conduct. The real challenge is discussing, what about animals who are not treated so badly? Should we eat them? And I would suggest, no, we should not. We do not need to. We do not need to cause them harm.</p><p end="45036" is_meta="false" speaker="Gene Baur" start="44973">And whenever animals are seen as consumable products, there is a tendency to treat them not very well. I've been to factory farms, I have been to small farms, and even on these farms that are purported to be humane, there are significant problems.</p><p end="45036" is_meta="false" speaker="Gene Baur" start="44973">Whenever the animals are seen as consumables, the relationship is one of exploitation,</p><p end="45036" is_meta="false" speaker="Gene Baur" start="44973">and that is a huge problem that we need to face, and something we don't need to do.</p><p end="45092" is_meta="false" speaker="Gene Baur" start="45036">In addition, animal production is very wasteful. The United Nations came out with a report a couple years ago talking about how animal agriculture is one of the top contributors to the most serious environmental problems we're facing on the planet,</p><p end="45092" is_meta="false" speaker="Gene Baur" start="45036">including climate change. And these animals are routinely fed antibiotics as well, so we have these antibiotic-resistant pathogens that are now developing on these farms. And so these are other problems associated with this attitude of looking at animals just as commodities. So, eating animals is bad for the animals. It is bad for the environment. It is bad for us. It is not necessary. We can live and be healthy on eating plants alone. I urge you to vote yes on the motion that we should not eat anything with a face. So thank you very much.</p><p end="45157" is_meta="false" speaker="Joel Salatin" start="45092">We're going to have an interesting evening since potatoes have eyes.</p><p end="45157" is_meta="true" speaker="Joel Salatin" start="45092">laughter</p><p end="45157" is_meta="false" speaker="Joel Salatin" start="45092">Corn has ears.</p><p end="45157" is_meta="true" speaker="Joel Salatin" start="45092">laughter</p><p end="45157" is_meta="false" speaker="Joel Salatin" start="45092">Cabbages have heads.</p><p end="45157" is_meta="true" speaker="Joel Salatin" start="45092">laughter</p><p end="45157" is_meta="false" speaker="Joel Salatin" start="45092">And, goodness, what are we going to do about those navel oranges?</p><p end="45157" is_meta="true" speaker="Joel Salatin" start="45092">laughter</p><p end="45157" is_meta="false" speaker="Joel Salatin" start="45092">Eating things with faces is great, so I'm happy with our negative position. Chris and I have some overarching positions.</p><p end="45157" is_meta="false" speaker="Joel Salatin" start="45092">Number one: affirmative studies, affirmative studies impugning animal farming or omnivorous nutrition must be based on pasture-based data, not chemical,</p><p end="45157" is_meta="false" speaker="Joel Salatin" start="45092">pharmaceutical, concentrated animal feeding operations, like CAFOs. On our farm, the nutrient difference in folate -- just pick one nutrient -- between a USDA-blessed -- we call it the "U.S. duh" --</p><p end="45210" is_meta="false" speaker="Joel Salatin" start="45157">The USDA-blessed egg at 47 micrograms and a Polyface-pastured egg at 1,200 micrograms are incomparable. Chris and I categorically reject any and all CAFOs,</p><p end="45210" is_meta="false" speaker="Joel Salatin" start="45157">chemical fertilization, aquifer irrigation, and genetic modification, as being necessary or meritorious in food production. Factory food has no merit in this debate, and none of the studies will hold water if they use factory food, and you'll find that they all do.Number two: Plants are sentient beings. They attack, communicate, respond, and build communities. Their language is chemical. Plants have faces, even though we might not recognize them. The affirmative promotes a segregated view toward life. Chris and I promote an integrated view.</p><p end="45271" is_meta="false" speaker="Joel Salatin" start="45210">Number three: The motion before you does not allow for climate, cultural, economic, or hunger contingencies. An essential thing: the affirmative has not asked for any contingencies. If the affirmative wanted some contingencies, they should have worded the resolution or not agreed to their position. Chris and I will hold them to the motion's clarity.</p><p end="45271" is_meta="false" speaker="Joel Salatin" start="45210">Number four: Domestic livestock are owned by 60 percent of the world's poor, primarily because they represent portable wealth to the unlanded poor and nutrition density protected from spoilage and vermin. The affirmative position is a direct attack on the world's poor.</p><p end="45271" is_meta="false" speaker="Joel Salatin" start="45210">Number five: Not a single affirmative study assumes modern, pasture-based models,</p><p end="45271" is_meta="false" speaker="Joel Salatin" start="45210">using high-tech electric fencing, portable shade cloth shelters, permaculture, hydration techniques, or cottage-based, localized processing infrastructure. This oversight dooms every affirmative conclusion to obsolescence.</p><p end="45271" is_meta="false" speaker="Joel Salatin" start="45210">Number six: Life requires death.</p><p end="45331" is_meta="false" speaker="Joel Salatin" start="45271">The fact that all of us can come to this luxurious room, comfortable and well-fed, and entertain ourselves by debating whether we should viscerally and actively participate in our role on an ecological continuum is bizarre.</p><p end="45331" is_meta="true" speaker="Joel Salatin" start="45271">laughter</p><p end="45331" is_meta="false" speaker="Joel Salatin" start="45271">Native Americans ate 10 pounds of buffalo a day, when they could get it. And plenty of starving children in the world would be grateful for a morsel of anything, whether it wiggles or not.</p><p end="45331" is_meta="false" speaker="Joel Salatin" start="45271">Number seven: Everything is eaten and being -- is eating and being eaten. If you don't believe that, go lie naked in your flowerbed for three days, and see what gets eaten.</p><p end="45331" is_meta="false" speaker="Joel Salatin" start="45271">Number eight: Humans are the ultimate caretaker species, and the notion that my dog is my uncle is my cat is my child does not indicate an evolutionary newfound state of heightened spiritual cosmic awareness, but rather a profound devolution into ignorance and disconnection to our ecological umbilical.</p><p end="45395" is_meta="false" speaker="Joel Salatin" start="45331">Number nine: Killing and eating are interchangeable. If it is wrong to eat, then it is wrong to kill. Killing without eating is an insult to life and resource.</p><p end="45395" is_meta="false" speaker="Joel Salatin" start="45331">Number ten: Environmental integrity demands certain patterns whether we like them or not. Chris and I believe these patterns supersede Mickey Mouse, Bambi, and Templeton, the rat. When my parents purchased 550 acres in Virginia&#8217;s Shenandoah Valley in 1961, it was a cheap and great. Gullies, many measuring maybe 12 feet deep,</p><p end="45395" is_meta="false" speaker="Joel Salatin" start="45331">incised the fields -- deep scars, testifying to the death from grain production. Organic matter averaged one percent. Large areas that had lost three to five feet of top soil were barren rock. At the time, the farm would only support 20 cows. Now, a mere 52 years later, organic matter averages 8 percent, the gullies are healing, the barren rock faces are covered with a foot of new top soil, and the farm supports 150 cows. Out of ashes came a phoenix. How? By mimicking the foundational principle of ecological health.</p><p end="45454" is_meta="false" speaker="Joel Salatin" start="45395">Animals (primarily herbivores), perennials, and predation. In case you missed this in biology class, here&#8217;s how it works: Sunlight converts to biomass through photosynthesis.</p><p end="45454" is_meta="false" speaker="Joel Salatin" start="45395">The biomass grows slowly at first, then rapidly, then goes into senescence. The herbivore prunes the senescence biomass back to restart the rapid growth cycle.</p><p end="45454" is_meta="false" speaker="Joel Salatin" start="45395">Predation -- both carnivorous and otherwise, like weather or fire -- creates movement patterns, even intensifying herbivores into mobs. All fertile soils have been built with perennials, herbivores, and predators, not tillage and annuals, like wheat and corn. By practicing this mob stocking herbivorous solar conversion lignified carbon sequestration fertilization, our farm is growing soil, growing organic matter, healing the water cycle,</p><p end="45454" is_meta="false" speaker="Joel Salatin" start="45395">and pulling greenhouse gases out of the atmosphere. Every single nook and cranny on the planet is full of animals. Why? Because they convert biomass into soil. From kitchen scraps fed to the homestead chickens to caribou converting lichens to manure,</p><p end="45454" is_meta="false" speaker="Joel Salatin" start="45395">animals create ecological integrity. :umans can&#8217;t eat most biomass.</p><p end="45520" is_meta="false" speaker="Joel Salatin" start="45454">The few types we can, like vegetables, require extremely fertile soil. Not one single organic vegetable or produce regimen exists that doesn&#8217;t rely on animal or fish manures for fertility. The principle of life requiring death or sacrifice is a most profound spiritual and ecological truth. How we treat the plant and animal in life impart sacredness to the sacrifice. The reason herbivores and seafood form the basis of all diets in antiquity is because these were the only nutrient-rich options that didn&#8217;t require tillage and storage. Until mechanization and cheap energy, tillage was extremely laborious.</p><p end="45520" is_meta="false" speaker="Joel Salatin" start="45454">Another critical ecological function for animals was that they were the only way naturehad of moving around fertility. Gravity pulls biomass downhill. The only way to defy gravity and pull it back uphill is to either walk it up or fly it up. What makes it do that?</p><p end="45520" is_meta="false" speaker="Joel Salatin" start="45454">Predation. The most efficacious way to remediate environmental degradation while producing the nutrition required by our human population is to embrace animal husbandry in a biomimicry paradigm: perennial, animal, predator.</p><p end="45579" is_meta="false" speaker="Joel Salatin" start="45520">Alan Savory&#8217;s eloquent TED talk explains proper animal management is the best hope for stopping climate change and desertification. So vote for ecological integrity and nutritional superiority that we should eat both plants and animals. In case you forgot,</p><p end="45579" is_meta="false" speaker="Joel Salatin" start="45520">it&#8217;s the negative position in this debate.</p><p end="45579" is_meta="true" speaker="Joel Salatin" start="45520">laughter</p><p end="45758" is_meta="false" speaker="M.D. Neal Barnard" start="45694">Well, I don't want to speak for Chris. But having read the documents that he circulated in advance, he had the psychiatric issues before he went vegetarian, while he was vegetarian, and after. And if I read them correctly, he said that eating cholesterol was not sufficient, that he also needed religion in order to fight his way back. And I say this not to mock it, but to say that these problems were pre-existing before the diet change.</p><p end="45758" is_meta="false" speaker="M.D. Neal Barnard" start="45694">And the studies that he cited were observational studies. We have put this to the test.</p><p end="45758" is_meta="false" speaker="M.D. Neal Barnard" start="45694">We worked with the insurance company Geico in ten different cities. And we introduced plant-based diets for about 300 people, and we measured levels of depression, levels of anxiety. They got better. And we have now about three randomized trials along these lines. People get better. And as people who have done this, they find they feel more energetic, which is why a lot of athletes are doing it.</p><p end="45758" is_meta="false" speaker="M.D. Neal Barnard" start="45694">Dental health acts exactly the same. In fact, even the study that he cited, when you looked over the longest period of time, the vegetarians kept their teeth more while the meat-eaters tended to lose them. This is not a reason to have a --</p><p end="45815" is_meta="false" speaker="Chris Masterjohn" start="45758">Or all of it?</p><p end="45815" is_meta="false" speaker="Chris Masterjohn" start="45758">Oh, sure.</p><p end="45815" is_meta="false" speaker="Chris Masterjohn" start="45758">Right. Well, Dr. Barnard is entirely correct, first of all, that all of the studies that I cited about vegetarianism and mental disorders are observational studies, and they cannot show whether vegetarianism causes mental disorders, mental disorders cause vegetarianism, or there's some other type of -- or there's some other type of relationship.</p><p end="45876" is_meta="true" speaker="Chris Masterjohn" start="45815">laughter</p><p end="45876" is_meta="false" speaker="Chris Masterjohn" start="45815">This is -- I mean, it's serious. Any of those are possibilities, and they're not mutually exclusive. What we do know is that there is a wealth of information about biochemistry and the effects of the specific nutrient deficiencies that can be most common in vegetarian diets that are all related to mental health. And so biologically, it's very plausible. But I would like to also make the point that Dr. Barnard cannot have his low-</p><p end="45876" is_meta="false" speaker="Chris Masterjohn" start="45815">fat, low-glycemic, vegan, chocolate cake and eat it to, because the studies that Dr.</p><p end="45876" is_meta="false" speaker="Chris Masterjohn" start="45815">Barnard cited at the beginning about the relationship between eating meat and cancer and coronary heart disease are also observational studies, and they also tell us absolutely nothing about cause-and-effect relationships. And --</p><p end="45876" is_meta="false" speaker="M.D. Neal Barnard" start="45815">Well, let me take issue with you there, if you don't mind.</p><p end="45876" is_meta="false" speaker="M.D. Neal Barnard" start="45815">I'm going to suggest that, Joel, if I went to your farm, and I got one of your chickens who, as I'm sure you'll agree, they are not natural chickens.</p><p end="45930" is_meta="false" speaker="M.D. Neal Barnard" start="45876">These are -- these are freaks of breeding over time. They are bred to become obese.</p><p end="45930" is_meta="false" speaker="M.D. Neal Barnard" start="45876">And if I took one of them who maybe never had even any chemical given to that chicken, but if I kill them and cooked them, these same heterocyclic amines, these clear-</p><p end="45930" is_meta="false" speaker="M.D. Neal Barnard" start="45876">cut carcinogens, would form on your chickens just like any other. So, regardless of whether it's organic or not, cooking skeletal muscle produces carcinogens. And that's why every epidemiologist agrees that vegetarians have less cancer. There's just no question about it.</p><p end="45930" is_meta="false" speaker="Joel Salatin" start="45876">Well --</p><p end="45930" is_meta="true" speaker="Joel Salatin" start="45876">applause</p><p end="45930" is_meta="false" speaker="Joel Salatin" start="45876">Anything, if you're trying to create cancer out of something -- an excess of anything can -</p><p end="45930" is_meta="false" speaker="Joel Salatin" start="45876">- you can drink too much water and get sick.</p><p end="45997" is_meta="false" speaker="Joel Salatin" start="45930">So, you know, in Argentina, their per capita consumption of red meat is double what it is in the U.S. In Argentina, the average person eats half a pound a day of red meat, and their cancer rate is half of the U.S. Why? Because it's grass-finished beef. And so there is a huge difference in the nutritional profile. I mean, you know, Chris would probably be able to speak to this better, but there are -- you know, there are carcinogens in virtually all foods. And, you know, you can isolate those however you want to.</p><p end="45997" is_meta="false" speaker="Gene Baur" start="45930">Yeah, well, I --</p><p end="45997" is_meta="false" speaker="Gene Baur" start="45930">-- =&#8217;ve been a vegan since 1985, and I have not been very religious about taking B12 supplements. But I get everything I get from plant sources, so the B12 I get is from plant sources. B12 is the only nutrient that you need to think about, and that's made by microorganisms. So it's available in the environment. It's available in the soil. And otherwise you get everything --</p><p end="46052" is_meta="false" speaker="Joel Salatin" start="45997">So it's in soil?</p><p end="46052" is_meta="false" speaker="Gene Baur" start="45997">There's soil on vegetables, isn't there?</p><p end="46052" is_meta="false" speaker="Joel Salatin" start="45997">Yeah.</p><p end="46052" is_meta="true" speaker="Joel Salatin" start="45997">talking simultaneously</p><p end="46052" is_meta="false" speaker="Joel Salatin" start="45997">The thing is, don't wash your kale.</p><p end="46052" is_meta="false" speaker="Joel Salatin" start="45997">So the point is, don't wash your kale.</p><p end="46052" is_meta="false" speaker="Gene Baur" start="45997">Don't sanitize and don't zap it.</p><p end="46052" is_meta="false" speaker="M.D. Neal Barnard" start="45997">Vitamin B12 is not made by animals. It's not made by plants. It is made by bacteria.</p><p end="46052" is_meta="false" speaker="M.D. Neal Barnard" start="45997">And historically, one theory is that the bacteria on plants, on the soil, on our fingers, in our mouths, give you that 2.4 micrograms, the tiny amount that you need. The other theory -- and people have shown that the bacteria in the human digestive tract actually produce absorbable B12, but in modern civilization, most of those bacteria are gone.</p><p end="46052" is_meta="false" speaker="M.D. Neal Barnard" start="45997">They're too low. They produce the B12 so you can't absorb it. But in more primitive cultures, in cultures in developing countries, you do see production of B12 in humans just like in the other primates, and it's fully absorbable. The truth is, nobody really knows for sure.</p><p end="46116" is_meta="false" speaker="M.D. Neal Barnard" start="46052">But what we do know is that most B12 people in hematology clinics are meat-eaters.</p><p end="46116" is_meta="false" speaker="M.D. Neal Barnard" start="46052">And they are low on B12 because they are not absorbing it. It's hard to absorb B12 from meat. You need good stomach acid. You need intrinsic factor. And the U.S. government recommends that all meat-eaters over the age of 50 take B12 supplements because otherwise --</p><p end="46116" is_meta="false" speaker="M.D. Neal Barnard" start="46052">-- they are deficient.</p><p end="46116" is_meta="false" speaker="Chris Masterjohn" start="46052">Yes. I would like to take this discussion back down to earth for a minute. So to put this in perspective --</p><p end="46116" is_meta="false" speaker="M.D. Neal Barnard" start="46052">No, that's not what I'm arguing.</p><p end="46116" is_meta="false" speaker="Chris Masterjohn" start="46052">I think we want to -- I think we want to --</p><p end="46116" is_meta="false" speaker="M.D. Neal Barnard" start="46052">I'm not arguing that. I'm arguing, take a supplement because you don't want to be relying on it.</p><p end="46116" is_meta="false" speaker="Chris Masterjohn" start="46052">Right.</p><p end="46116" is_meta="false" speaker="M.D. Neal Barnard" start="46052">Right.</p><p end="46116" is_meta="false" speaker="Chris Masterjohn" start="46052">I mean, to put this back into context, we should just look at what are the studies on vitamin B12 deficiency levels in vegetarians, in vegans, and in elderly subjects who have poor digestion.</p><p end="46179" is_meta="false" speaker="Chris Masterjohn" start="46116">And, so, one of the ways that we can get a bird&#8217;s-eye view of this literature is to look at what's called a meta-analysis, which is just a study that looks at all of the other relevant studies and pools the data together. And the most recent study -- the most recent pooled analysis of 18 studies using the highest quality markers of vitamin B12 deficiency found vitamin B12 deficiency in between 30 to 73 percent of vegetarians, between 43 to 90 percent of vegans, and the length of time on the vegetarian diet was also related to the deficiency. So, for example, one study found that 67 percent of lifelong vegetarian children and only -- or 25 percent of other vegetarian children -- were deficient. So it's a deficiency that can take years and years to develop.</p><p end="46179" is_meta="false" speaker="M.D. Neal Barnard" start="46116">But studies also show that giving meat to those children doesn't solve the problem.</p><p end="46179" is_meta="false" speaker="M.D. Neal Barnard" start="46116">What solves the --</p><p end="46179" is_meta="false" speaker="M.D. Neal Barnard" start="46116">Absolutely. You can take a B12 deficient person, give them meat, and they will still be B12 deficient.</p><p end="46234" is_meta="false" speaker="M.D. Neal Barnard" start="46179">What everybody recommends, every doctor always recommends, don't rely on meat for B12. They always recommend a supplement because it's cheap, and it's safe. And that's true whether you're a vegan or a meat-eater. It's a complete red herring. Everybody ought to be taking B12. It's been the U.S. government position for years. They say start at 50. I --</p><p end="46234" is_meta="false" speaker="Joel Salatin" start="46179">Well, I certainly believe everything the U.S. government says.</p><p end="46234" is_meta="true" speaker="Joel Salatin" start="46179">laughter</p><p end="46234" is_meta="true" speaker="Joel Salatin" start="46179">applause</p><p end="46234" is_meta="false" speaker="M.D. Neal Barnard" start="46179">You can take your chances. But the other thing to just mention, when you're talking about grass-fed beef, when my grandfather had his heart attack and died, it was grass-</p><p end="46234" is_meta="false" speaker="M.D. Neal Barnard" start="46179">fed beef that my family raised, that we all ate because there weren't CAFOs back then.</p><p end="46234" is_meta="false" speaker="Joel Salatin" start="46179">You know, you're trying to poke fun at this side for not being scientific or anecdotal.</p><p end="46234" is_meta="false" speaker="Joel Salatin" start="46179">What's more anecdotal than when you're dad died? Mine -- my mom's 90,</p><p end="46234" is_meta="false" speaker="Joel Salatin" start="46179">independent, drives every day, dances every weekend. She's 90. She's eaten meat from day one, all of her life. The fact is we're different.</p><p end="46295" is_meta="false" speaker="M.D. Neal Barnard" start="46234">We are different.</p><p end="46295" is_meta="false" speaker="Joel Salatin" start="46234">We're different.</p><p end="46295" is_meta="false" speaker="Joel Salatin" start="46234">That's right, yeah.</p><p end="46295" is_meta="false" speaker="M.D. Neal Barnard" start="46234">Most smokers don't get lung cancer, but so many do. Most meat-eaters are not going to get colorectal cancer, and they're not going to get stomach cancer, but so many do.</p><p end="46295" is_meta="false" speaker="M.D. Neal Barnard" start="46234">Yes.</p><p end="46295" is_meta="false" speaker="M.D. Neal Barnard" start="46234">Oh, yeah, well --</p><p end="46295" is_meta="false" speaker="Joel Salatin" start="46234">Yes. Absolutely.</p><p end="46295" is_meta="true" speaker="Joel Salatin" start="46234">laughter</p><p end="46295" is_meta="false" speaker="M.D. Neal Barnard" start="46234">-- It depends on what we're talking about. With something like cancer, you can't ethically do a randomized trial where you have half the people eat meat, and you track their cancer risk and have the other become vegan. There are ethical issues about doing that because it is so clear that meat is linked to cancer, you couldn't get -- you couldn't do such a study. You couldn't ask half a group to smoke cigarettes. We know cigarettes cause cancer. We know meat is going to increase cancer risk.</p><p end="46295" is_meta="false" speaker="Chris Masterjohn" start="46234">There are two things that we could look at to improve our perspective on the meat and cancer relationship. One would be to try to control for all the differences between vegetarians and non-vegetarians to better understand in those observational studies.</p><p end="46355" is_meta="false" speaker="Chris Masterjohn" start="46295">The other point would be to go back to the evidence that I brought up in the beginning.</p><p end="46355" is_meta="false" speaker="Chris Masterjohn" start="46295">Weston Price, I mentioned his research in the beginning --</p><p end="46355" is_meta="false" speaker="Chris Masterjohn" start="46295">-- he was the first research director for the American Dental Association and a pioneer in nutritional and medical anthropology. His approach was to try to look at populations that were actually free of disease. And so what he found was that in some cases -- his data on tooth decay were far better than his data on cancer. But he had some data on cancer, and there were cases of populations that did not have modernized diets but had meat in their diets that were free of cancer. What that means is that even the most vulnerable members of the population were protected. We don't know if they were protected by meat. But if you take a population of smokers, that's not what you find.</p><p end="46413" is_meta="false" speaker="Chris Masterjohn" start="46355">There is no population of heavy smokers where all of them are free from cancers. So it&#8217;s a fundamentally different point.</p><p end="46413" is_meta="true" speaker="Chris Masterjohn" start="46355">talking simultaneously</p><p end="46413" is_meta="false" speaker="Chris Masterjohn" start="46355">Yes. Yeah, absolutely. So --</p><p end="46474" is_meta="false" speaker="Joel Salatin" start="46413">Yeah. But the problem is that all of your meat studies are based on toxin-laden meat that's been raised in a factory-farming situation. If you take that out of it, the nutrition and the analysis is completely different. And not only that, but I'd like to ask a question -- you're talking about cooking, cooking, cooking, does that mean -- I'd like to get back to the topic actually -- that if we don't cook it and eat raw meat, then we're okay and it's okay to eat meat with a face if we don't cook it?</p><p end="46474" is_meta="false" speaker="M.D. Neal Barnard" start="46413">The point that I made is that when you analyze meat, some of the carcinogens are produced by cooking. The HDAs and the PHs are just from heating it up --</p><p end="46537" is_meta="false" speaker="M.D. Neal Barnard" start="46474">Joel Salatin:Yeah, same thing happens with vegetables.</p><p end="46537" is_meta="false" speaker="M.D. Neal Barnard" start="46474">-- and good heavens, no --</p><p end="46537" is_meta="true" speaker="M.D. Neal Barnard" start="46474">talking simultaneously</p><p end="46537" is_meta="false" speaker="Gene Baur" start="46474">I just wanted --</p><p end="46537" is_meta="false" speaker="Gene Baur" start="46474">Well, in terms of the science, there's The China Study which the New York Times called the "Grand Prix of Epidemiology," done by T. Colin Campbell, a biochemist at Cornell University. And what he found was that the more animal foods people ate, the more problems they had; the more plants foods people ate, the healthier they were. And these were animal foods that were not necessarily produced in factory farms, so just the animal foods were correlated with human health problems, including cancers. And so that was not factory-farmed meat. It was range-fed meat or grazing animals, and they were still problems.</p><p end="46537" is_meta="false" speaker="Joel Salatin" start="46474">The China Study has been debunked by so many experts it&#8217;s -- it shouldn&#8217;t even be brought up in this debate.</p><p end="46537" is_meta="true" speaker="Joel Salatin" start="46474">talking simultaneously</p><p end="46537" is_meta="false" speaker="Joel Salatin" start="46474">That&#8217;s how bad it is.</p><p end="46537" is_meta="false" speaker="Chris Masterjohn" start="46474">= don&#8217;t want to parse it tediously, but I just would like to say one sentence --</p><p end="46591" is_meta="false" speaker="Chris Masterjohn" start="46537">Just the one-sentence point. If you go to the original data, there is no correlation between meat intake and cancer. If you read T. Colin Campbell&#8217;s book, what he does it make a rather convoluted argument that some things are associated with meat, those things are associated with cancer, and so on, but the actual data doesn&#8217;t show a direct correlation like that.</p><p end="46651" is_meta="false" speaker="Gene Baur" start="46591">Well, = think over the course of our history, we&#8217;ve done what we&#8217;ve had to do to survive,</p><p end="46651" is_meta="false" speaker="Gene Baur" start="46591">and often that has been eating meat, but it&#8217;s also sometimes been eating other people.</p><p end="46651" is_meta="false" speaker="Gene Baur" start="46591">And we&#8217;ve also done a lot of things over the course of our history that have not been very good, you know? You know, you think of institutions like slavery. And as time goes,</p><p end="46651" is_meta="false" speaker="Gene Baur" start="46591">we come to look at these things more critically and we start making decisions and choices that are, I think, more humane. And when it comes to animals, they have feelings like we do.</p><p end="46710" is_meta="false" speaker="Gene Baur" start="46651">They&#8217;re not that much different than we are, and there&#8217;s been attempts to rationalize and say, well, they are different. They don&#8217;t use tools, for example. Then Hane Goodallfound that animals were using tools, and we had to change our thinking and say, well,</p><p end="46710" is_meta="false" speaker="Gene Baur" start="46651">they don&#8217;t use language; but now we see that these other animals use language. You know, turkeys and chickens have many different calls for different things, and as we learn, you know, I think our responsibility grows. And the fact is, we can choose not to eat other animals. =n the case of a lion, they don&#8217;t have a choice. =n the case of us, we do have a choice.</p><p end="46710" is_meta="false" speaker="Gene Baur" start="46651">To me, it&#8217;s about not causing unnecessary suffering. So if = don&#8217;t need to cause harm to somebody else, =&#8217;m going to try not to do that. And, you know, there&#8217;s a difference between dying and being murdered. You know?</p><p end="46773" is_meta="false" speaker="Gene Baur" start="46710">And even people like E. B. White wrote about this, you know, who wrote Charlotte&#8217;s Web. He said a farm is a peculiar problem for a man who likes animals, because the fate of most livestock is that they are murdered by their benefactors. The creatures may live serenely, but they end violently and the odor of doom hangs about them always. So there&#8217;s -- it&#8217;s about our relationship with other animals. =s it about compassion and kindness or is it about cruelty --</p><p end="46773" is_meta="false" speaker="Gene Baur" start="46710">-- and exploitation and killing?</p><p end="46773" is_meta="false" speaker="Joel Salatin" start="46710">Yeah, well, you know, = don&#8217;t have any problem with vegans. = really don&#8217;t.

And there have been people doing this for decades.</p><p end="46891" is_meta="false" speaker="Joel Salatin" start="46834">Okay, so how much acreage -- how much extra acreage -- is it going to take to farm that way?</p><p end="46891" is_meta="false" speaker="Gene Baur" start="46834">Well, you need to do rotation.</p><p end="46891" is_meta="true" speaker="Gene Baur" start="46834">talking simultaneously</p><p end="46891" is_meta="false" speaker="Joel Salatin" start="46834">It's going to take about three or four times, maybe five times, the amount of acres we're currently using.</p><p end="46891" is_meta="false" speaker="Gene Baur" start="46834">Well, if we're not having to grow a lot of crops to feed a lot of livestock, we'll have enough land for that.</p><p end="46891" is_meta="false" speaker="Joel Salatin" start="46834">We don't --</p><p end="46891" is_meta="false" speaker="Joel Salatin" start="46834">-- I already said we don't have to grow the crops to feed the livestock because there's that much scavenging and that sort of thing going on. The problem is that we're not using animals in their historically normal role, which is as scavengers, whether it's pigs scavenging acorns in the woods, chickens eating, you know, vegetable scraps. If every household had a couple of chickens to eat their vegetable scraps, there wouldn't even be a factory farm chicken industry, and you wouldn't even have to put the garbage on a garbage truck to send it to a composting facility to go onto your, you know, ornamental flowerbeds.</p><p end="46956" is_meta="false" speaker="Gene Baur" start="46891">Well, I'm not against, you know, somebody having chickens that they feed the scraps.</p><p end="46956" is_meta="false" speaker="Gene Baur" start="46891">But then where I have the issue though is when somebody goes up and then cuts off their head.</p><p end="46956" is_meta="true" speaker="Gene Baur" start="46891">laughter</p><p end="46956" is_meta="true" speaker="Gene Baur" start="46891">applause</p><p end="46956" is_meta="false" speaker="Gene Baur" start="46891">You know, that's where the problem is.

And if people were not eating animals with a face, or even years ago,</p><p end="47013" is_meta="false" speaker="M.D. Neal Barnard" start="46956">people didn't eat animals anywhere -- anywhere -- like that.

It's one.</p><p end="47075" is_meta="false" speaker="M.D. Neal Barnard" start="47013">Now, we're talking about whether --</p><p end="47075" is_meta="false" speaker="Chris Masterjohn" start="47013">Sure.</p><p end="47133" is_meta="false" speaker="Gene Baur" start="47075">Well, I mean, I don't know the science about that.

Say that again?</p><p end="47133" is_meta="false" speaker="M.D. Neal Barnard" start="47075">You're feeding the soybeans to the cows.</p><p end="47133" is_meta="true" speaker="M.D. Neal Barnard" start="47075">talking simultaneously</p><p end="47133" is_meta="false" speaker="Joel Salatin" start="47075">We've already agreed soybeans don't need to be fed to cows. We don't need to grow a single soybean.</p><p end="47133" is_meta="false" speaker="Chris Masterjohn" start="47075">-- no, no, no. Excuse me, when you eat the soybeans --</p><p end="47133" is_meta="false" speaker="Chris Masterjohn" start="47075">When you eat the soybeans yourself --</p><p end="47133" is_meta="true" speaker="Chris Masterjohn" start="47075">laughter</p><p end="47196" is_meta="false" speaker="M.D. Neal Barnard" start="47133">Okay. The short answer is no. People -- but you're raising an important paradox, is that in some of these fad diets, people would eat what seemed like a lot of meat, but theywere still losing weight because they were avoiding all carbohydrate. But in more careful study, it all came down to calories. If people eating that way did not reduce their overall calorie intake, they didn't lose an ounce. And that's why a lot of people on Atkins and other diets like that, they just don't lose weight.</p><p end="47257" is_meta="false" speaker="M.D. Neal Barnard" start="47196">And that's why almost all of them end up regaining and going beyond later, plus their cholesterol levels go through the roof, and they have -- over the long run, these people do miserably.</p><p end="47257" is_meta="false" speaker="Chris Masterjohn" start="47196">Sir?</p><p end="47257" is_meta="false" speaker="Chris Masterjohn" start="47196">I would like to take a crack at that.</p><p end="47257" is_meta="false" speaker="Chris Masterjohn" start="47196">So I've read a lot of Dr. Barnard's studies, and I'm very impressed by the way that they're designed and the way that they're reported. But if you look at the data, what I think Dr. Barnard has clearly shown is that the metabolic effects and the improvements in almost every health measure are due to weight loss. And what Dr. Barnard has created is a run-of-the-mill, weight-loss diet with mediocre efficacy, where there's lots of positive effects due mostly to the weight loss that occurs in the first three to six months and then starts creeping back up. And if you &#8211;</p><p end="47257" is_meta="false" speaker="M.D. Neal Barnard" start="47196">No --</p><p end="47257" is_meta="false" speaker="Chris Masterjohn" start="47196">Wait a second. Just let me -- please let me the point, and then you can respond --</p><p end="47257" is_meta="false" speaker="M.D. Neal Barnard" start="47196">I can do it much quicker.</p><p end="47312" is_meta="false" speaker="Gene Baur" start="47257">Again, the more that we look at these animals, the more we learn that they have sentience, that fish have feelings, they have memory, they learn from each other. And,</p><p end="47312" is_meta="false" speaker="Gene Baur" start="47257">again, we don't need to kill them and eat them.</p><p end="47379" is_meta="false" speaker="Gene Baur" start="47312">So from an ethical standpoint, I say we don't need to. And again, I've been a vegan since 1985, gotten everything I've needed from plants.</p><p end="47379" is_meta="false" speaker="Joel Salatin" start="47312">Well, absolutely. And, you know, I find it fascinating that all of the attributes given to animals plants have too. The DNA structure of grasses, for example, when you introduce a species, it nativizes its DNA structure to become more climatically nativized to a certain place. That's memory. That's genetic memory and adaptation to a certain place. If that isn't responding to things, I don't know what is. And I just absolutely don't appreciate this false dichotomy that when I take the life of a carrot [bites], the carrot doesn't scream.</p><p end="47379" is_meta="false" speaker="Joel Salatin" start="47312">I'm absolutely good with the fish.</p><p end="47379" is_meta="true" speaker="Joel Salatin" start="47312">laughter</p><p end="47379" is_meta="false" speaker="Joel Salatin" start="47312">I like fish.</p><p end="47379" is_meta="false" speaker="Joel Salatin" start="47312">But -- but I will say this: I only eat fish when I'm on the coast. I don't eat fish in Oklahoma City. That's part of the local -- the integrity, the nesting in the womb, that creates that -- that food integrity.</p><p end="47433" is_meta="false" speaker="Joel Salatin" start="47379">So I love to eat clam chowder when I go to New England, but I don't want to get clam chowder in St. Louis.</p><p end="47433" is_meta="false" speaker="M.D. Neal Barnard" start="47379">15.</p><p end="47433" is_meta="false" speaker="M.D. Neal Barnard" start="47379">When we look at fish eaters and compare them to meat-eaters, they are marginally slimmer than people who eat heavy amounts of meat, but they are nowhere near as slim as the vegetarians. The fish eaters as a group have more diabetes. Carcinogens form in cooked salmon just like in cooked chicken. And there's nothing like getting the skeletal muscle out of your diet.</p><p end="47433" is_meta="false" speaker="Chris Masterjohn" start="47379">And fish also have a central system and brains.</p><p end="47500" is_meta="false" speaker="Gene Baur" start="47433">You know --</p><p end="47500" is_meta="false" speaker="Gene Baur" start="47433">And once --</p><p end="47500" is_meta="true" speaker="Gene Baur" start="47433">applause</p><p end="47500" is_meta="false" speaker="Gene Baur" start="47433">-- and once that animal is dead, do they still have a face?</p><p end="47500" is_meta="true" speaker="Gene Baur" start="47433">laughter</p><p end="47500" is_meta="false" speaker="Gene Baur" start="47433">I mean, I would say that from an ethical standpoint, if somebody has lived and then they die, they're going to be eaten by somebody, either worms or bugs or another animal.</p><p end="47500" is_meta="false" speaker="Gene Baur" start="47433">So from my standpoint, ethically, you know, you've not taken the life of somebody with a face in that case.</p><p end="47554" is_meta="false" speaker="Joel Salatin" start="47500">Humans are part of the ecology. You know, we can't wake up one day and say, "I'm not going to participate in this, like a frog can't wake up on the edge of a pond one morning and say, "You know, I'm just not going to practice being a frog today."</p><p end="47554" is_meta="true" speaker="Joel Salatin" start="47500">laughter</p><p end="47554" is_meta="false" speaker="Joel Salatin" start="47500">We are the caretaker species. Humans are the only ones who can decide to procreate and not. Animals don't, animals just do. You know, we tend to not eat each other. You know, if a chicken dies in the yard, why, you know, the others eat it right up.</p><p end="47625" is_meta="false" speaker="Joel Salatin" start="47554">Pigs the same way. I always tell my kindergarteners when they come out for farm tours in the pigpen, you know, "Keep moving, guys. These are omnivores." You know.</p><p end="47625" is_meta="true" speaker="Joel Salatin" start="47554">laughter</p><p end="47625" is_meta="false" speaker="Joel Salatin" start="47554">So I would simply say that instead of viewing what I would call our role as caretakers, as some sort of an elitist dominion idea, rather take it as, "Heavy rests the head that wears the crown." Therefore, we must exercise the greater responsibility in massaging our ecological umbilical, so that it actually attracts more solar energy in the biomass than it would in a static state. And that's exactly what pasture-based agriculture does.</p><p end="47625" is_meta="false" speaker="Chris Masterjohn" start="47554">Joel and I essentially agree on this, so I'm not going to add too much, but I do think one of the things that the other side needs to articulate is a way to approach this harm reduction in a way that is economically and ecologically sustainable.</p><p end="47676" is_meta="false" speaker="Chris Masterjohn" start="47625">So one of the things that I wonder -- and this could be taken as an open-ended question,</p><p end="47676" is_meta="false" speaker="Chris Masterjohn" start="47625">definitely not a criticism -- one of the things that I wonder in reading your book, for example, Gene, which I really love and I agree with you on, you know, 95 percent of it, is -- what I'm wondering is, if we are to say we should have a world without animal farming, what does that post animal farming world look like? For example, on your Farm Sanctuary, you sterilize the male mammals and make sure that you don't have any reproduction, so we're exercising some responsibility in minimizing harm to those animals by keeping the population size down. So when we shift to a post-animal farming world, do we move towards eradication of the domesticated, farm species, or do we have something like your sanctuary on a larger scale?</p><p end="47730" is_meta="false" speaker="Chris Masterjohn" start="47676">And if it's a larger scale, how is it economically sustained?</p><p end="47730" is_meta="false" speaker="Gene Baur" start="47676">Well, as I mentioned, there are some veganic farms now that are forming, and I think that's a very good model. I think it's also important to recognize that all species of farm animals, with the exception of the turkey, have been imported into the U.S. So cattle,</p><p end="47730" is_meta="false" speaker="Gene Baur" start="47676">for example, are now ranging where bison used to range. And so I think bison should be back there. And when we're growing plants and eating them directly, it requires far less acreage. So a lot of wild space could be left wild. And veganic farming is not necessarily no animals. There are wild animals. And you're interacting with animals but in a less harmful way. And that's what it's about, it&#8217;s doing as good as you can, causing as little harm as possible, and this is an evolving process.

We embrace it, we participate in it, and offer an alternative, and what =&#8217;m suggesting is that a biomimicked -- like the bison and the wolf &#8211; system. You know, the U.S. 500 years ago had more pounds of animals on the U.S. than are here today with all of our intensive agriculture.</p><p end="47851" is_meta="false" speaker="Gene Baur" start="47801">You know, you also speak about dominion --</p><p end="47851" is_meta="false" speaker="Joel Salatin" start="47801">That&#8217;s the truth.</p><p end="47851" is_meta="false" speaker="Gene Baur" start="47801">You know, we have dominion, as you mentioned, and we have -- we can play a role and either be kind or kill, you know? And we don&#8217;t need to kill. So -- and there are ways to grow food with plants without using animals. There&#8217;s veganic agriculture. =t is coming.</p><p end="47915" is_meta="false" speaker="Chris Masterjohn" start="47851">Sure, I just want to make two really quick points. One: since you bring up -- since you bring up evolution and Dr. Barnard brought up primates, I just -- worth pointing out that chimpanzees according to Dr. Craig Stamford, whose expertise is in that area -- eat 50 to 100 grams of meat per day. They hunt it and they use it as a commodity to trade it for food and sex, and also for their sustenance. But on evolution, I think, the lesson that evolution gives us is that there&#8217;s variation in the population. That variation changes over time. And so =&#8217;m not arguing that no one can be healthy on a vegan diet.</p><p end="47972" is_meta="false" speaker="Chris Masterjohn" start="47915">= think Gene proves that you can, but the point is the motion doesn&#8217;t say, &#8220;Some People Should Not Eat Anything without a Face.&#8221; It says, "Don&#8217;t Eat Anything without a Face,&#8221;</p><p end="47972" is_meta="false" speaker="Chris Masterjohn" start="47915">and what we see is that there are genetic variations, like I mentioned in the beginning and many others, where not everyone can get the nutrients from plant foods as well as other people. Some people will do well; some people won&#8217;t. That&#8217;s the lesson from evolution is that variation.</p><p end="48031" is_meta="false" speaker="Gene Baur" start="47972">There&#8217;s actually a book out on --</p><p end="48031" is_meta="false" speaker="Gene Baur" start="47972">-- eating vegan on four dollars a day. So eating vegan does not necessarily have to be very expensive. You can get beans and rice and -- you know, cooking also is something that we&#8217;ve lost sight of, and it&#8217;s another part of this process -- is preparing food. Instead of just going to the store and getting a bag of potato chips, we can go get a sack of potatoes and work with that. And --</p><p end="48099" is_meta="false" speaker="M.D. Neal Barnard" start="48031">Meat is very expensive. You have to raise the corn or whatever that you're feeding them, you have to irrigate it, do all these things. You feed it to the animal. The reason it's cheap at the store is that your tax dollars are going to subsidize the feed grains. Andif those subsidies were ended suddenly, a burger -- the price of a burger would be through the roof. Dried beans are -- cost pennies.</p><p end="48099" is_meta="false" speaker="M.D. Neal Barnard" start="48031">Dried rice costs pennies.</p><p end="48099" is_meta="false" speaker="M.D. Neal Barnard" start="48031">No. And in fact, when Dean Ornish did that work that I was describing, he had a control group that was allowed to eat meat, leaner cuts and that kind of thing. But by and large, they got worse, not better.</p><p end="48153" is_meta="false" speaker="M.D. Neal Barnard" start="48099">And when we started seeing cases of reversal of diabetes, we couldn't do that with the meat-based diet. It just -- it just doesn't work at all. Same with --</p><p end="48153" is_meta="false" speaker="Joel Salatin" start="48099">That's, of course, meat from a factory farm.</p><p end="48153" is_meta="false" speaker="M.D. Neal Barnard" start="48099">No, no --</p><p end="48153" is_meta="false" speaker="M.D. Neal Barnard" start="48099">No, it doesn't matter. And the same with --</p><p end="48153" is_meta="false" speaker="Joel Salatin" start="48099">The study wasn't used pasture-based meat, was it? Did it? No, it didn't!</p><p end="48153" is_meta="false" speaker="M.D. Neal Barnard" start="48099">Up until relatively recently --</p><p end="48153" is_meta="false" speaker="M.D. Neal Barnard" start="48099">-- none of it was CAFOs. The reversal of erectile dysfunction that we've seen took a --</p><p end="48153" is_meta="false" speaker="M.D. Neal Barnard" start="48099">always occurred with vegan diets. It never occurred with a meat diet.</p><p end="48214" is_meta="false" speaker="Gene Baur" start="48153">There is still a relationship there with animals that is violent, and bloody, and it's unnecessary.

And there are lots of little bugs that live in the world -- and live in our bellies even -- that we interact with without an intentional harm being caused.

This is the -- what we call the nooks and crannies, the fringes, you know, where -</p><p end="48337" is_meta="false" speaker="Joel Salatin" start="48274">- that's why herbivores are all over the planet,</p><p end="48394" is_meta="false" speaker="Joel Salatin" start="48337">because they are not only pruning the biomass, but they are actually stimulating photosynthetic activity, and they are -- they're doing all these wonderful things. And they are, by and large, not living on areas that are corn and soybeans. You guys keep bringing up corn and soybeans, and I'm suggesting we don't need any of that either.</p><p end="48394" is_meta="false" speaker="Gene Baur" start="48337">=t&#8217;s not about all of the wonderful things that they&#8217;re doing --</p><p end="48394" is_meta="false" speaker="Joel Salatin" start="48337">What we need is a balanced approach of plants and animals that mimics the kind of complex, relational interactions between plants and animals that the ecology illustrates.</p><p end="48451" is_meta="false" speaker="Gene Baur" start="48394">I think it's really all about the relationship, you know. And in this country, you know, the deer populations are actually managed so we can have people go out and kill them. So the hunting is actually used as an excuse to go kill. We've removed all the natural predators. So I'm in favor of a more natural ecosystem and then for human beings to interact in a humane way and to not cause harm if we don't need to. And hunting is certainly harm.</p><p end="48511" is_meta="false" speaker="Joel Salatin" start="48451">Go ahead.</p><p end="48511" is_meta="false" speaker="Chris Masterjohn" start="48451">I guess, isn't this a matter of the directness of our complicity rather than our complicity?</p><p end="48511" is_meta="false" speaker="Chris Masterjohn" start="48451">So if we move towards a world that has more wild animals with more predators, where those animals are not -- I know there are issues with humane slaughtering now -- but those animals will suffer the same fate of factory-farmed animals, where they can get ripped apart where they're still alive. You still have those animals dying. The slaughter is less humane than it could be with humans. So aren't we just removing our directness in the complicity rather than our actual complicity?</p><p end="48511" is_meta="false" speaker="Joel Salatin" start="48451">Pre-14 --</p><p end="48511" is_meta="true" speaker="Joel Salatin" start="48451">applause</p><p end="48511" is_meta="false" speaker="Gene Baur" start="48451">One thing I have to do --</p><p end="48571" is_meta="false" speaker="Gene Baur" start="48511">You know, you can't control others. You can only control yourself. And other animals,</p><p end="48571" is_meta="false" speaker="Gene Baur" start="48511">you know, have the world they live in. And, you know, we talk about dominion and hubris and human arrogance, in a sense. And, you know, we're part of this planet. And saying that we need to go there to save those animals is, I don't think, a very good way to look at it. We interact with other animals. It's about the relationship. What is that relationship going to look like? And if we can live with other animals without killing them, without exploiting them, without putting them in small cages, and, you know &#8211;</p><p end="48571" is_meta="false" speaker="Gene Baur" start="48511">&#8216;cause once we start doing that, it tends to go pretty badly. And I've been to your farm,</p><p end="48571" is_meta="false" speaker="Gene Baur" start="48511">Joel, and, you know, I really appreciate that it's open, and people are allowed to visit,</p><p end="48571" is_meta="false" speaker="Gene Baur" start="48511">but some of the conditions were pretty bad.</p><p end="48631" is_meta="false" speaker="Chris Masterjohn" start="48571">Large-scale, epidemiological evidence that has been recently published shows that vegetarians who shop at health food stores, or otherwise health conscious, have no benefit over meat-eaters who shop at health food stores, or otherwise health conscious.And this tells us nothing about causation because it's a correlation. Dean Ornish showed that a program limiting sugar, sugar derivatives, corn syrup, white flour, fat,</p><p end="48631" is_meta="false" speaker="Chris Masterjohn" start="48571">alcohol, smoking cessation, peer-support exercise and stress management, through meditation, stretching, and visualization, along with the exclusion of meat, reverses heart disease, perhaps,</p><p end="48691" is_meta="false" speaker="Chris Masterjohn" start="48631">but hasn't shown that reversing meat, specifically, does. What this means is that science is very complex, so I'd like to offer a way to synthesize the information in a way that embraces the uncertainty as a source not of frustration and confusion but of empowerment. We should take as our baseline the spectrum of traditional diets associated with population-wide freedom from degenerative disease, where even the most vulnerable members of the population were protected. These diets all lacked refined foods and all contain nutrient-dense animal foods regardless of whether they ate a little or a lot. We should build on this with our scientific understanding of physiology which shows that animal foods provide nutrition and that dietary needs vary from one individual to another, and it may, in the same individual, vary from one period of life to another. We should -- this emphasizes the importance of fine-tuning our dietary approach to achieve what makes us personally as individuals healthiest.</p><p end="48756" is_meta="false" speaker="Chris Masterjohn" start="48691">The motion tonight fails to prevent the death and suffering of animals in an ecologically and economically sustainable way. It's inconsistent with traditional diets not validated by modern science and reduces our ability to individualize our diets as needed. Because its particular form of absolutism is so lopsided, it's even more harmful than the converse proposition to always eat something with a face. So I urge you to vote against it.</p><p end="48756" is_meta="false" speaker="M.D. Neal Barnard" start="48691">If your teenage son or daughter were to say to you, "Mom, Dad, I made up my mind.</p><p end="48756" is_meta="false" speaker="M.D. Neal Barnard" start="48691">I'm going to eat my fruits and vegetables, and I'm going to have veggie burgers and things, but I'm just not going to eat anything with a face. I -- don't worry, I know how todo it. I know where to get my protein." If you then looked at the numbers and you realized that your child's risk of becoming obese or having a heart attack or developing cancer just plummeted, you would be thrilled.</p><p end="48813" is_meta="false" speaker="M.D. Neal Barnard" start="48756">And if you were part of an insurance group where your costs were dependent on the health of that group, and if every other member said, "I'm not going to eat any meat,"</p><p end="48813" is_meta="false" speaker="M.D. Neal Barnard" start="48756">you'd be thrilled, because you're going to save a huge amount of money. The world's strongest man is Patrik Baboumian, who recently lifted 1,210 pounds on an entirely plant-based diet. The world's greatest ultra long distance runner is Scott Jurek. He runs 100 miles, 125 miles, 150 miles at one stretch faster than any living human being on an entirely plant-based diet. This past Monday, the World Memory Championships were held in London.

And, arguably the world's greatest brain, Albert Einstein wrote some words I want to share with you, "In my view, that the -</p><p end="48813" is_meta="false" speaker="M.D. Neal Barnard" start="48756">-</p><p end="48873" is_meta="false" speaker="M.D. Neal Barnard" start="48813">&#8220;-- It's my view that the vegetarian manner of living, by its purely physical effect on the human temperament, would most beneficially influence the lot of mankind." And Einstein continued, "So I am living without fats, without meat, without fish. And I'm feeling quite well this way. It always seems to me that man was not born to be a carnivore."

And that's I think what's happened tonight. The fact is that science is subjective based on the prejudice of the researchers. They set up the experiments this way. And so you got to look at who finances them, where the money goes, and decide what to do. That's how Monsanto got the, you know, GMOs through. They used geriatric rats. When the same experiments were repeated in Scotland with juvenile rats, all sorts of problems came up with GMOs. So I kind of, I kind of go philosophical on this, you know. We can trade dead bodies and thin people and heart attacks all night, alright?</p><p end="48932" is_meta="true" speaker="Joel Salatin" start="48873">laughter</p><p end="48932" is_meta="false" speaker="Joel Salatin" start="48873">So, I find it fascinating that Gene says that Jesus and Muhammad could not show compassion.

Our eyes are in the front of our heads. We have incisors. We're not built like prey. We are predators. And remember, there are no exceptions in this topic.

It requires far fewer resourses to grow plant foods as opposed to animal foods. It is the way people with few resources have eaten for thousands and thousands of years. Our massive, animal-consuming lifestyle is fairly recent. We all agree that factory farming is bad, and we need to look at that because most of the animals who are killed and eaten today come from factory farms. If we think that that is unacceptable, we need to vote yes on the motion not to eat anything with a face.

We&#8217;ve done a lot of very bad things, but when we have choices, when we have options, when we can live in a way that does not cause harm, why wouldn&#8217;t we? The word &#8220;humane&#8221; and &#8220;slaughter&#8221; don&#8217;t go very well together, and when you try to rationalize that these animals are there to be killed and eaten by us, many other bad things do happen. And I have been to a number of factory farms, I have been to a number of small farms, where animals are put in small areas,</p><p end="49116" is_meta="false" speaker="Gene Baur" start="49056">where they&#8217;re put in cages even, at these so-called &#8220;humane&#8221; farms. When the animals are seen as commodities, and as edibles, they are not treated with respect. That is bad for the animals, and = would also suggest it is bad for us. =&#8217;m not saying everybody who eats animals is a mean person. You know, we all grow, we all learn, we evolve, and when we learn, we can do better, and that&#8217;s what it&#8217;s ultimately about.</p><p end="49174" is_meta="false" speaker="Gene Baur" start="49116">=t&#8217;s about intent.
