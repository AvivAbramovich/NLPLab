And so --</p><p end="380" is_meta="true" speaker="Alan Dershowitz" start="323">laughter</p><p end="380" is_meta="false" speaker="Alan Dershowitz" start="323">-- I think you guys have to give me a little break. These guys are all smarter than I am, so there [unintelligible] --</p><p end="380" is_meta="false" speaker="Alan Dershowitz" start="323">My partner in this debate is the very, very distinguished professor, Sandy Levinson,</p><p end="380" is_meta="false" speaker="Alan Dershowitz" start="323">who's just written his own great book.</p><p end="514" is_meta="false" speaker="David Kopel" start="456">The trick is you make the pre-dinner prayer optional and that makes the ACLU folks happy. And then you have a lot of sharp knives around, and the NRA people are content.</p><p end="514" is_meta="true" speaker="David Kopel" start="456">laughter</p><p end="567" is_meta="false" speaker="Eugene Volokh" start="514">On a good day it's better than that.</p><p end="693" is_meta="false" speaker="Sanford Levinson" start="631">Thank you. I want to begin by repeating a point that Bob Rosenkranz made. This is not a debate about policy. As it happens, I can't completely speak for my colleague,</p><p end="693" is_meta="false" speaker="Sanford Levinson" start="631">Professor Dershowitz, but I would very much oppose, for example, a federal law banning guns independent of the Second Amendment, because it is very, very clear that there is a critical mass of Americans who would be vehemently opposed to that. It would just add to the divisions in the country and it would increase the number of criminals in the country, because just as with drug laws and gambling laws and the like,</p><p end="693" is_meta="false" speaker="Sanford Levinson" start="631">there is no reason to believe that such a law could generally be enforced. Most enforcement requires a willingness to comply with a law that one regards as relatively legitimate, and this law would not be regarded, I think, in that capacity.</p><p end="752" is_meta="false" speaker="Sanford Levinson" start="693">It's also true with regard to a number of other gun control statutes that are proposed that I have distinctly mixed feelings about, many of them on a variety of policy grounds,</p><p end="752" is_meta="false" speaker="Sanford Levinson" start="693">but fortunately we're not here to debate that. Nor do I think we are here to debate the one true meaning of the Second Amendment, as interesting as that topic is, and about which indeed I have written. Rather, I want to emphasize the topic that is in front of us,</p><p end="752" is_meta="false" speaker="Sanford Levinson" start="693">The Constitutional Right to Bear Arms has Outlived Its Usefulness. Now, one reason I relish this statement of the question is that I'm one of those relatively rare people, I will admit, who actually believe there should be a new constitutional convention, because I believe that a number of provisions of the constitution have outlived their usefulness.</p><p end="807" is_meta="false" speaker="Sanford Levinson" start="752">I wouldn't even say that the Second Amendment or the right to bear arms is the one that has most outlived its usefulness, but I'm really quite happy to argue that in 2013 the kinds of considerations that led to the placement of the Second Amendment in the Bill of Rights, which Bob Rosenkranz summarized, I think, very well, have outlived their usefulness. So, if we were going to have a debate in 2013 about what substantiverights, as well as what structures the Senate, bicameralism, presidential veto and stuff like that, what would a 2013 or 2015 constitution look like? Would it include a substantive right in the United States constitution to bear arms?</p><p end="870" is_meta="false" speaker="Sanford Levinson" start="807">And I would argue that the answer is no. Let me also emphasize that this is a different question from whether state constitutions should include a right to bear arms. Eugene has written one of the definitive articles showing, I don't know what the current number is, but I think it's over 40, state constitutions do protect a right to bear arms, and that raises a very, very important question of whether we need to have that in the United States constitution as well. Let me give you two principle reasons why a constitutionalized right to bear arms instead of a right to bear arms that would simply be fought out in the political process, and all of us know that the political process today is tilted either legitimately or illegitimately, that's the topic of yet another debate that we need not have this evening, generally in favor of the rights of gun owners.</p><p end="925" is_meta="false" speaker="Sanford Levinson" start="870">So, let me give you the two reasons why I think the Second Amendment has outlived its usefulness in the 21st century. The first reason is precisely that it is anti-federal. That is to say, one of the anomalies -- sometimes very difficult to tell the players without a scorecard -- in the debate about gun rights. There are many people who define themselves as conservatives who rail against a rampaging national government that believes in one-size-fits-all solutions to national problems. Well, this is not necessarily what Heller decides, but it is what the Supreme Court decided two years later in the McDonald case, where it held that every state in the union has to toe a single line.</p><p end="982" is_meta="false" speaker="Sanford Levinson" start="925">Louis Brandeis spoke very eloquently of states as little laboratories of experimentation.</p><p end="982" is_meta="false" speaker="Sanford Levinson" start="925">Most states have chosen to experiment in favor of gun rights. There are some states --</p><p end="982" is_meta="false" speaker="Sanford Levinson" start="925">or cities -- very dense cities, like Washington, D.C., that would prefer different experiments. Or in New York itself, one can well imagine a particular policy for the great cities of New York and a very different policy for upstate New York, where there are far,</p><p end="982" is_meta="false" speaker="Sanford Levinson" start="925">far more hunters than is the case in Manhattan, say. And one of the things that a single national constitutional amendment -- as interpreted by the Supreme Court -- does is to stifle that kind of federalism. And I think that's a mistake.</p><p end="1040" is_meta="false" speaker="Sanford Levinson" start="982">But there's a second real problem with constitutionalizing the right to bear arms in the 21st century. As Mr. Rosenkranz suggested, the right to bear arms -- or the Second Amendment -- had a kind of cosmetic value until 2008. It's not that people didn't writeabout it. I wrote about it. Eugene wrote about it. A number of people found it very interesting. But it played remarkably little role in actual American law. Beginning with Heller, it does play a role. But what does that mean? It means that you turn over decision-making power to a group of federal judges who are highly divided, who have no expertise in this area, and who make often quite remarkable -- even unreasoned --</p><p end="1040" is_meta="false" speaker="Sanford Levinson" start="982">distinctions.</p><p end="1104" is_meta="false" speaker="Sanford Levinson" start="1040">Thus, for example, in Heller, Justice Scalia says that Dick Heller is protected, which I think is a perfectly plausible argument, but he suggests that Martha Stewart is not,</p><p end="1104" is_meta="false" speaker="Sanford Levinson" start="1040">because she actually lied to an FBI agent and is thus a convicted felon. I don't think judges should be making those kinds of decisions. I think legislators should.</p><p end="1104" is_meta="false" speaker="Eugene Volokh" start="1040">All right. Thank you very much for having me here. And it's such a great pleasure to be on the same panel with David, and Alan, and Sandy. They're all top scholars and I also reckon all of them as friends of mine.</p><p end="1161" is_meta="false" speaker="Eugene Volokh" start="1104">And so let me start with something I think we all agree on, on the panel. And I think probably virtually everybody -- perhaps everybody in the audience agrees on too, and that is that there's a basic human right to self-defense. And there are, of course,</p><p end="1161" is_meta="false" speaker="Eugene Volokh" start="1104">debates about the particular boundaries of that right. But there's a core to that right that every state in the union recognizes. I'm sure it's well-recognized outside the U.S. as well. If somebody is threatening you with imminent death, serious injury, rape,</p><p end="1161" is_meta="false" speaker="Eugene Volokh" start="1104">kidnapping, you're entitled to use force, even deadly force, in order to defend yourself if that is necessary. That is very broadly agreed on. And I think it's agreed on because it is a basic human right. So I think there's little difference about that. But then there's the question -- what does that right entail? And I want to argue that a right to self-defense,like other rights, entails the right, at least presumptively, to have the tools that are necessary to reasonably effectively defend yourself.</p><p end="1225" is_meta="false" speaker="Eugene Volokh" start="1161">Let's take an example. The right to control whether you want to reproduce, whether you want to have children or not. Imagine somebody says oh sure, I'm all for that right, you can use birth control so long as it's the rhythm method. We wouldn't say that's a serious argument. We'd say it's a parody of an argument, right? We'd say well of course, the right to control your reproductive future involves the right to use tools that are reasonably necessary in order to effectively do that. That's not just for that right, it's also for speech. Your right to speak doesn't just mean the right to move your mouth, it's the right to use the internet, to use various other technologies that are reasonably necessary to effectively defend yourself. And guns are reasonably are necessary to effectively defend yourself. Our own bodies, you know, we sometimes can defend ourselves with that, but not when our assailant is armed with a gun or otherwise, and even if unarmed, if the assailant is sufficiently big, sufficiently strong, sufficiently ruthless, the only way we can effectively defend ourselves in many situations is with a gun, often not by shooting it. The overwhelming majority of all defensive gun users involve just threatening to use it.</p><p end="1292" is_meta="false" speaker="Eugene Volokh" start="1225">Just a couple of thought experiments. I'm sure some of you live in places -- in houses where on the front lawn it says protected by armed patrol. I suspect few of you live in houses where on the front lawn it says protected by unarmed patrol. I would be willing to bet that. So in a sense really, those people who have the money to have armed guards, either personal bodyguards or people driving by, are already entitled to essentially take advantage of this technology to defend themselves. The right to bear arms gives people the ability to do that, even if they can't afford to hire someone. If they are their own armed guards, that's what the right to keep and bear arms allows people to do. And I think it's no surprise then that 44 of the state constitutions specifically protect a right to bear arms, and over 40 of them clearly in a way that's an individual right to bear arms, and this isn't just some weird anachronism. This dates back from the Pennsylvania constitution 1776 to the Kansas constitution in I think 2012,</p><p end="1292" is_meta="false" speaker="Eugene Volokh" start="1225">and several constitutions in the preceding couple of decades as well.</p><p end="1344" is_meta="false" speaker="Eugene Volokh" start="1292">Now, some people may say well okay, fine. It's reasonable to say there's a presumption in favor of being able to have tools needed to defend yourself, but maybe it should be rebuttable. If there's solid enough evidence that banning guns or seriously limiting guns would protect us so much that that outweighs whatever loss to self-defense there may be, well, then we should do that. Well, interesting argument, but there is no suchevidence. So, in 2004, the National Research Council appointed a committee of scholars, of criminologists. They put out this very nice report. You can read it for free online. The consensus was based on the existing studies there's no evidence that either extra gun ownership or extra gun restrictions would make people safer.</p><p end="1404" is_meta="false" speaker="Eugene Volokh" start="1344">Centers for Disease Control in 2005, similar study, similar result. The other studies as well from New York's own New York University: James Jacobs, looks at can gun control work. His answer, not as an ideologue on this, is probably not, at least based on what we know. Now, of course, Sandy might say all right, these are all interesting questions,</p><p end="1404" is_meta="false" speaker="Eugene Volokh" start="1344">but why do they need to be resolved as a constitutional matter by judges? Well, one reason might be that we do have a tradition of resolving, indeed on a national level,</p><p end="1404" is_meta="false" speaker="Eugene Volokh" start="1344">questions of basic human rights as to free speech, as to searches and seizures, a variety of other things we have taken them off of the federalism process. We have set them up as human rights for the country as a whole, but still one could very reasonably ask this question as to whether this makes sense. Well, I think the answer to that you have to think practically, and you have to think about what is likely to be effective in our country given the political realities. And so for that you have to ask yourself, what do you want?</p><p end="1404" is_meta="false" speaker="Eugene Volokh" start="1344">If you're interested in gun control, what is it that you want?</p><p end="1470" is_meta="false" speaker="Eugene Volokh" start="1404">Now, if what you want -- so you might want gun bans or handgun bans, or you might want modest gun controls, background restrictions on mentally ill people, limits on size of large capacity magazines. You have to decide what is it that you want. Now, if you want the former, if you want total gun bans or handgun bans, well, good luck to you with the war on guns that you're going to have to get, even if you can repeal the Second Amendment, even if you can persuade people the Second Amendment has outlived its usefulness. There are going to be lots of people you won't persuade. There are 300 million guns in the country. They're not just going away. Criminals will have access to them, and as Sandy pointed out, a lot of otherwise law-abiding people will become criminals because they will insist on retaining them. Aha, people say well, but that's not what we want, right? We want modest gun controls, that's what I always hear.</p><p end="1470" is_meta="false" speaker="Eugene Volokh" start="1404">Probably most people do want just modest gun controls, but if you want modest gun controls the Second Amendment in court already doesn't stand in your way. Courts have routinely upheld against right to bear arms challenges. There's a wide range of modest gun controls. To be sure, there's [unintelligible] federal level in many states,</p><p end="1470" is_meta="false" speaker="Eugene Volokh" start="1404">though not so hard in other states, but that's a political constraint, not a legal constraint.</p><p end="1525" is_meta="false" speaker="Eugene Volokh" start="1470">The Second Amendment is not a barrier to the enactment of those gun control -- some people think it should be. But as a descriptive matter, it actually hasn't been and isn't likely to be. But what's more, if you want modest gun controls, the Second Amendment is your friend. And any attempt to repeal it -- that is what your enemy would be.</p><p end="1525" is_meta="false" speaker="Eugene Volokh" start="1470">Because all of those people who have been assured, "Oh, I'm not going to take away your guns. Oh, if you think people are going to take away your guns, you're just paranoid" -- if there is, indeed, a move to repeal the Second Amendment, which I think is the implication of the conclusion that it's outlived its usefulness would be, that would turn that all -- make it all sound like lies and make people worry that indeed that's what's going to happen, that people will be coming for their guns. So if you want modest gun controls -- I'm not saying you should -- but if you do, you should be arguing that the Second Amendment has not outlived its usefulness. Part of its usefulness --</p><p end="1525" is_meta="false" speaker="Eugene Volokh" start="1470">besides self-defense -- is precisely the assurance it gives to people that people are not coming for their guns, as so many people, including the president --</p><p end="1591" is_meta="false" speaker="Eugene Volokh" start="1525">-- have ensured them. --</p><p end="1591" is_meta="false" speaker="Alan Dershowitz" start="1525">Thank you. What a great and powerful argument. No wonder he is considered a genius.</p><p end="1591" is_meta="false" speaker="Alan Dershowitz" start="1525">But let's think about his argument for a minute. The argument was really not so much in favor of the Second Amendment. It was in favor of the right of self-defense. You areright. We all agree. There should be a right of self-defense. So don't you agree with me that it would have been better if the Second Amendment had been written as "Everybody has the right of self-defense" -- then we could argue whether or not guns were necessary, what kinds of guns, what kinds of restrictions.</p><p end="1647" is_meta="false" speaker="Alan Dershowitz" start="1591">You would also then have to debate whether or not guns were permissible for hunting,</p><p end="1647" is_meta="false" speaker="Alan Dershowitz" start="1591">because hunting is not part of self-defense. The Second Amendment reads rather differently. It starts out by saying "A well-regulated militia, being necessary to the security of a free state," then &#8220;the right of the people to bear and keep arms.&#8221; So, I think everybody would agree that the first clause of the Second Amendment, "well-regulated militia," has outlived its usefulness. We do not have militias, state militias. They are as anachronistic as the Third Amendment, talking about that we can't quarter troops. Now,</p><p end="1647" is_meta="false" speaker="Alan Dershowitz" start="1591">that doesn't mean that I would want to amend the Bill of Rights. I don't want to amend the Third Amendment. I prefer to leave it there, because if you start amending the Third Amendment, Sandy will have a constitutional convention. And he'll have people who might start amending the First Amendment, and the Fourth Amendment, and the Fifth Amendment.</p><p end="1711" is_meta="false" speaker="Alan Dershowitz" start="1647">So I'm happy to leave all the amendments there, as long as we acknowledge that the Second Amendment, like the Third Amendment, has outlived its usefulness. My point is it would have been so much better if we had established the primary right in the Constitution, the right of self-defense. Then we would have nothing to debate. We would all agree there is a right to self-defense. We would then be able to debate what the derivative right is from the right of self-defense, just like we debate today as to what the derivative right of privacy is from the Fourth Amendment, the right of the people to be secure in their homes and places. But we have to distinguish between the primary right and the secondary right. The primary right should be the right of self-defense. Of course I throw the question to my distinguished opponents: are they conceding that the Second Amendment should be interpreted to abolish the right of hunters to own weapons that are useful only in killing animals and are not useful in defending one's home or oneself?</p><p end="1770" is_meta="false" speaker="Alan Dershowitz" start="1711">Should one have to demonstrate that one is using the weapon for self-defense? Would you rewrite the Second Amendment, if you had the choice, and abolish the term "a well-</p><p end="1770" is_meta="false" speaker="Alan Dershowitz" start="1711">regulated militia," and say, instead, "The right of self-defense, being necessary to the security of a free state, the right of the people to keep and bear arms shall be infringed."</p><p end="1770" is_meta="false" speaker="Alan Dershowitz" start="1711">It seems to me, from Professor Volokh's argument, that he would support such an amendment, or at the very least, if he had been a framer of the Constitution, he wouldhave preferred an amendment which started out with the right of self-defense being essential. So I think you've helped defeat your own argument by creating --</p><p end="1770" is_meta="true" speaker="Alan Dershowitz" start="1711">laughter</p><p end="1770" is_meta="false" speaker="Alan Dershowitz" start="1711">-- a new basic fundamental right --</p><p end="1770" is_meta="true" speaker="Alan Dershowitz" start="1711">applause</p><p end="1770" is_meta="false" speaker="Alan Dershowitz" start="1711">-- and then deriving the right that's in the Constitution from that fundamental right. And so, the question remains, what difference would it make? The difference is fundamental.</p><p end="1823" is_meta="false" speaker="Alan Dershowitz" start="1770">I agree with you. Basic rights should be recognized by constitutions. Virtually every country in the world today recognizes the right of self-defense. Four countries in the world, Mexico, Guatemala, Haiti, and the United States, I think, recognize the right to bear arms, so the vast majority of countries feel and believe that you can have a right of self-defense without necessarily having a fundamental right to bear arms. It seems to me that that's a relevant consideration, and I agree with my distinguished colleague that the lavatories of democracy should be allowed to operate. And we should not federalize this constitutional right. We should not be the only leading industrial country in the world that has as a fundamental right the right to bear arms.</p><p end="1885" is_meta="false" speaker="Alan Dershowitz" start="1823">What do the four countries that have a right to bear arms have in common? What does Mexico, Guatemala, Haiti, and the United States have in common? They all have extraordinarily high crime rates, extraordinarily high murder rates, extraordinarily high death rates. I don't want to get into the argument because I agree, all of us would agree here, the statistics cut both ways. You can make arguments in favor of the fact that guns cause death, other arguments that guns prevent death, but look at the reality in a common sense way. Look at the fact that we are a country infested with murder and death and gun injuries and suicide and accidents in the home. It cannot be a coincidence that the easy availability of guns in our country has nothing to do with high murder rates. That just can't be a coincidence.</p><p end="1885" is_meta="true" speaker="Alan Dershowitz" start="1823">applause</p><p end="1948" is_meta="false" speaker="Alan Dershowitz" start="1885">Yes there are cultural differences. To be sure, Japan is not the United States, England is not the United States, but when you look at the crime rates in those countries and do allthe comparisons you want, you can compare inner cities in one country with inner cities in another country and I know you can get all kind of data to support your conclusions,</p><p end="1948" is_meta="false" speaker="Alan Dershowitz" start="1885">but at bottom the question really comes to what kind of society do you want to live in?</p><p end="1948" is_meta="false" speaker="Alan Dershowitz" start="1885">Do you want to live in a society where we are forced to defend ourselves by guns, where the more the bad guys get guns the more the good guys have to arm and get guns? I&#8217;m reminded of the great episode from "All in the Family" where Archie Bunker gets to do an op-ed on television. And he says, "The way to solve the problem of airplane hijacking is very simple. Require everybody who gets on an airplane to have a gun. That way nobody will hijack an airplane." Do you want to get on a plane in which everybody has a gun?</p><p end="2007" is_meta="false" speaker="Alan Dershowitz" start="1948">And do you want to live in an America where everyone has a gun? If the answer to that question is no, let's acknowledge that the 2nd Amendment is anachronistic, has outlived its usefulness. Let's not abolish or amend the 2nd Amendment, let's construe it reasonably to permit gun control, to limit the ownership of guns to the right of self-</p><p end="2007" is_meta="false" speaker="Alan Dershowitz" start="1948">defense, perhaps -- here I'm going to go further than you, perhaps also allow hunters to have limited access to guns. That's my position. Thank you.</p><p end="2007" is_meta="true" speaker="Alan Dershowitz" start="1948">applause</p><p end="2081" is_meta="false" speaker="David Kopel" start="2007">Thank you. Thank you. When I'm not in New York City, I spend just about all my waking hours in one particular case in a civil rights lawsuit in federal district court in Colorado where I represent 55 of Colorado's elected sheriffs who are suing against the unconstitutional extreme and highly immodest laws pushed down on Colorado by Mr.</p><p end="2081" is_meta="false" speaker="David Kopel" start="2007">Bloomberg's successful lobbying last spring. In the United States Supreme Court I presented briefs on behalf of a very large national coalition of law enforcement organizations in District of Columbia versus Heller and McDonald versus Chicago.</p><p end="2081" is_meta="false" speaker="David Kopel" start="2007">Included in that coalition are the two organizations -- national organizations of police trainers, the police who train the police. My clients, like the vast majority of law enforcement officers, according to every survey of law enforcement officers ever done,strongly support the Second Amendment and oppose laws which make it difficult for law-abiding citizens to own firearms for protection, because they believe that guns in the right hands substantially enhance public safety.</p><p end="2143" is_meta="false" speaker="David Kopel" start="2081">What's some of the evidence for this belief? Well, in the United States, when a burglary takes place against a home, 13 percent of the time, the victims are in the home. It's called a hot burglary or a home invasion burglary. In contrast, in England, the rate of home invasion burglaries is 59 percent. In the Netherlands, it's 45 percent. And this is because, in the United States, people can lawfully own guns for self-defense in their home and have them readily available for self-defense in an emergency, unlike in those other nations. Studies of working burglars in Pennsylvania, Massachusetts, Connecticut,</p><p end="2143" is_meta="false" speaker="David Kopel" start="2081">and St. Louis have consistently found that burglars -- most burglars in the United States work quite hard, spend a large portion of their working day trying to make sure that there's nobody home because they perceive a very high risk of getting shot if they do come in when somebody is home.</p><p end="2189" is_meta="false" speaker="David Kopel" start="2143">And in fact, in the United States, the risk that a burglar will be shot exceeds the risk that he will go to prison. And if you think prison has some deterrent value against burglary --</p><p end="2189" is_meta="false" speaker="David Kopel" start="2143">and I certainly do -- then home self-defense has an even stronger protective value. The Centers for Disease Control is not a pro-gun propaganda organization. They conducted a national survey in 1994. They found that that year, there were 503 thousand defensive gun uses against burglars. Usually, without -- in the United States. Usually without a shot even being fired. And in 99 percent of those cases, when the victim confronted the burglar, the burglar decided it was time to leave work early.</p><p end="2253" is_meta="true" speaker="David Kopel" start="2189">laughter</p><p end="2253" is_meta="false" speaker="David Kopel" start="2189">Now, if you look at when burglaries do happen against victims in the home, they frequently lead to not only a burglary, but to assaults against people in the home. If you simply take our 13 percent home invasion burglary rate and scale that up to the 45 percent rate of some other countries, that would lead to an additional half million assaults every year in this country. That, by itself, would raise the national crime rate by nine percent. Guns are not only useful against burglars and for deterring burglars, but for self-defense in general. This summer the National Research Council and the Institute of Medicine -- two federal research centers -- at the request of President Obama, put together an expert panel of the leading social scientists on firearms policy issues to provide recommendations for what future topics need to be researched, and also, on what topics has consensus been achieved among social scientists.</p><p end="2304" is_meta="false" speaker="David Kopel" start="2253">What they said in their report was that the social science is clear, that when a victim is attacked, using a firearm defensively leads to a lower rate of victim injury, to a lower rate of crime completion than any other protective strategy. It is the safest thing to do for the crime victim on a broadly -- broad-scaled statistical basis. And they also said the social science is clear, that guns are used at least for good, lawful, defensive purposes --</p><p end="2304" is_meta="false" speaker="David Kopel" start="2253">at least as often as they are used for criminal purposes. Of course the benefit to law enforcement of this is enormous, in the fewer victimizations; the fewer crimes, the fewer people they have to respond to and help so they can help other people.</p><p end="2366" is_meta="false" speaker="David Kopel" start="2304">Now, why is the Second Amendment necessary today? To protect people from local,</p><p end="2366" is_meta="false" speaker="David Kopel" start="2304">bigoted governments. It was necessary in the civil rights era, when civil rights workers frequently had to arm themselves in the South for protection against the domestic terrorist organization known at the Ku Klux Klan, when local police were often complicit with the Klan. It's why the Deacons for Defense and Justice were formed in Bogaloosa [spelled phonetically], Louisiana in 1965, to successfully provide armed protection to organizations such as the Congress of Racial Equality. It was necessary in Washington,</p><p end="2366" is_meta="false" speaker="David Kopel" start="2304">D.C., where Dick Heller spent every day as an armed guard at the Federal Judicial Center and was not allowed by the D.C. City Council to use any firearm in his home, ever, for lawful self-defense against a violent home invader. It was necessary in Chicago, where Otis McDonald, a 70-year-old Korean War veteran received personal death threats from gangsters because of his anti-gang work.</p><p end="2426" is_meta="false" speaker="David Kopel" start="2366">And Chicago said, "Well, you can have a rifle or a shotgun." He knew how to use a rifle.</p><p end="2426" is_meta="false" speaker="David Kopel" start="2366">He had been in the Korean War, but for his condition in the apartment he lived in with his physical strength and agility and the current status it was, the handgun was the right choice for him for self-defense, and the bigoted city council of Chicago would not allow him to use that, and that's why the Second Amendment was necessary, and it's necessary in New York City right now. If you have a handgun permit in New York City,</p><p end="2426" is_meta="false" speaker="David Kopel" start="2366">you can go on a trip. You can drive from Brooklyn all the way to Seattle and lawfully carry that gun in your car in every state across the country and it's a good secure thing to have in case your car breaks down in the middle of the night someplace on a deserted road. But the New York City police department won't let you take the handgun out of the city. There is no rational basis for that prohibition. It is purely for the oppression of gun owners to the detriment of self-defense. It is a dangerous law and a Second Amendment lawsuit will likely be necessary to remove that.</p><p end="2486" is_meta="false" speaker="David Kopel" start="2426">I urge you to vote against this deadly dangerous proposition to vote for public safety based on the recognition that today the Second Amendment remains vitally necessary to the security of a free state. Thank you.</p><p end="2607" is_meta="false" speaker="David Kopel" start="2560">Real quick. The Second Amendment is the right to keep and bear arms. As Heller and McDonald say, it's the right to keep and bear arms for all lawful purposes, self-defense,</p><p end="2607" is_meta="false" speaker="David Kopel" start="2560">hunting, target shooting, whatever.</p><p end="2666" is_meta="false" speaker="David Kopel" start="2607">It's not limited to self-defense. Certainly self-defense is the most important purpose of that right under Heller. That's what the Supreme Court said was the core purpose of the right, but the Supreme Court didn't say that was the only purpose of the right. The right is for all lawful purposes and modern constitutions, state constitutions say so more explicitly, but their point is the same as the Second Amendment.</p><p end="2666" is_meta="false" speaker="Alan Dershowitz" start="2607">Not at all. I think the Second Amendment historically gives the right of the people the right to use guns against their government. As Jefferson said over and over again, we need to have armed citizens in the state to make sure that there are no monarchies trying to take over. It was a right of revolution. There was no debate, as far as I know,</p><p end="2666" is_meta="false" speaker="Alan Dershowitz" start="2607">about self-defense. It may have been implicit, but the Second Amendment's language and many of the people who are the strongest supporters of the Second Amendment are literalists.</p><p end="2733" is_meta="false" speaker="Alan Dershowitz" start="2666">They go to the original understanding. They look at the words -- why are you prepared to excise the first, whatever it is -- 10 words from the Constitution? "A well-regulated militia, being necessary to the security of a free state" -- are you prepared to concede that a well-regulated militia is no longer necessary to the security of a free state?</p><p end="2733" is_meta="false" speaker="Eugene Volokh" start="2666">No.</p><p end="2733" is_meta="false" speaker="Eugene Volokh" start="2666">No, I want neither. I want neither. So the -- I think, on this point, the court was quite right that if you look at the way the word "militia" was understood around the time of the framing -- and actually remains a legal definition of the term, although not a common lay definition -- militia meant the armed, adult -- at the time -- male citizenry,</p><p end="2733" is_meta="false" speaker="Eugene Volokh" start="2666">the times being what they were. And "well-regulated" meant basically well-functioning,</p><p end="2733" is_meta="false" speaker="Eugene Volokh" start="2666">well-trained. So, really, what they were saying is an armed, well-functioning citizenry --</p><p end="2733" is_meta="false" speaker="Eugene Volokh" start="2666">well-functioning as a body that knows how to use its weapons -- is necessary to the security of a free state.</p><p end="2788" is_meta="false" speaker="Eugene Volokh" start="2733">And that because of that, because -- and this is a preamble that explains the rationale or part of the rationale for the right -- because of that, the government shouldn't be able to disarm the people. But --</p><p end="2788" is_meta="false" speaker="Eugene Volokh" start="2733">The point was both. And that is one of the things that the court, I think, correctly [unintelligible] --</p><p end="2788" is_meta="true" speaker="Eugene Volokh" start="2733">speaking simultaneously</p><p end="2788" is_meta="false" speaker="David Kopel" start="2733">Here -- Alan, here's what you're overlooking. If you --</p><p end="2788" is_meta="false" speaker="Alan Dershowitz" start="2733">So, what does "well-regulated" mean? What you're trying to do is now say that everybody who owns an individual gun has to be a part of a regulated militia. They have to come to the green every day and march and --</p><p end="2845" is_meta="false" speaker="Alan Dershowitz" start="2788">[inaudible] --</p><p end="2845" is_meta="false" speaker="Alan Dershowitz" start="2788">But we don't have a well-regulated militia now. We don't have any kind of militia now.</p><p end="2845" is_meta="false" speaker="Alan Dershowitz" start="2788">So I think you're conceding that the first part of the amendment has outlived its usefulness. We win at least the first half of the debate, right?</p><p end="2845" is_meta="true" speaker="Alan Dershowitz" start="2788">applause</p><p end="2845" is_meta="false" speaker="David Kopel" start="2788">Sure. Thomas Cooley, the great constitutional scholar of the latter 19th century,</p><p end="2845" is_meta="false" speaker="David Kopel" start="2788">addressed your exact point. And he said that the interpretation you're following woulddefeat the purpose of the Second Amendment, because that would mean the government, by neglecting the militia, could thereby destroy the right to arms.</p><p end="2910" is_meta="false" speaker="David Kopel" start="2845">We might have more public safety if there were something to encourage more regulated, well-trained citizen defense patrols, for example, in communities. But that's up to the government --</p><p end="2910" is_meta="false" speaker="Alan Dershowitz" start="2845">Like the Ku Klux --</p><p end="2910" is_meta="false" speaker="David Kopel" start="2845">Wait --</p><p end="2910" is_meta="false" speaker="Alan Dershowitz" start="2845">Like the Ku Klux Klan?</p><p end="2910" is_meta="false" speaker="David Kopel" start="2845">Well, we can't force them to do that.</p><p end="2910" is_meta="false" speaker="David Kopel" start="2845">But this government's neglect does not destroy the underlying right.</p><p end="2910" is_meta="false" speaker="Sanford Levinson" start="2845">I would certainly consider it. It makes a lot of sense. But quite obviously, as I suggested in my opening remarks, it's a very, very capacious right. Does it extend to Martha Stewart, a convicted felon? And to me, it seems the answer should be yes. If Martha Stewart had knocked over a bank with a gun, I'm not sure that I would say she preserves her constitutional right to self-defense.</p><p end="2965" is_meta="false" speaker="Sanford Levinson" start="2910">What about non-U.S. Nationals who live in the United States? You know, do they not bleed? Do they not have lives that are threatened? And then what about illegal aliens?</p><p end="2965" is_meta="false" speaker="Sanford Levinson" start="2910">The Fifth Circuit, as I'm sure Eugene and David both know, split 2-1 on whether or not a federal law that prohibits illegal aliens from possessing guns is constitutional. Their argument was that the point of the original Second Amendment -- and I think they're correct. I didn't do adequate justice to Bob Rosenkranz's initial introduction -- I think the historical origins of the Second Amendment really do have to do with citizen militias and organizing to overthrow corrupt governments. And the argument was that an illegal alien isn't part of the American community politically, which is certainly true. That doesn't mean that an illegal alien has no right to self-defense.</p><p end="3029" is_meta="false" speaker="Eugene Volokh" start="2965">The right of the people to bear --</p><p end="3029" is_meta="false" speaker="Eugene Volokh" start="2965">-- arms throughout American history has had a self-defense component as well. We see that in the Pennsylvania constitution of 1776, which talked about the right of the people to keep and bear arms in defense of themselves in the states later on was more clearly even changed to each citizen defense of himself --</p><p end="3029" is_meta="false" speaker="Sanford Levinson" start="2965">But that wasn't put in the U.S. constitution. They knew about that and they didn't put it in.</p><p end="3029" is_meta="false" speaker="Eugene Volokh" start="2965">But they talked about the right of the people to keep and bear arms. What you're suggesting is that the Second Amendment -- you're suggesting the Second Amendment is obsolete in part because it used -- the framers used the term keep and bear arms there in a way that's different from the way that it was being commonly used in the coordinate state constitutions of the time. I think you're creating obsolescence of your own making. You're interpreting it in a strange way as saying well, it wasn't intended to deal with the self-defense, and now you're saying it's obsolete. Well, I'm saying it was intended throughout to deal with self-defense. It was also aimed at a means of deterring government tyranny, but the interest of self-defense has been always around,</p><p end="3029" is_meta="false" speaker="Eugene Volokh" start="2965">and if you look at court decisions of the early 1800s, all the time --</p><p end="3091" is_meta="false" speaker="Eugene Volokh" start="3029">John Donvan:Eugene, let's let Alan [unintelligible]. Alan Dershowitz.</p><p end="3091" is_meta="false" speaker="Alan Dershowitz" start="3029">-- focusing on the wrong words. I'm not denying that the right to bear arms might have some current relevance as part of a right of self-defense. What I am arguing is that prelude to the operative words of the amendment clearly have become obsolete, a well-regulated militia being necessary to the security. Now, the answer that David gives is you want the Deacons of Justice to be able to come and have an armed conflict with the Ku Klux Klan. Now I was in the south during the Civil Rights Movement. The last thing Martin Luther King wanted was to arm the people and the civil rights workers. He wanted to confront violence with peace, and a well-regulated militia would've included the Ku Klux Klan. They were the citizens. They were the ones who were worried about the government taking away their civil right to have a segregated community. And the answer that my opponents give is if the Ku Klux Klan is armed, then we ought to arm civil rights workers, and let's have a war. I think Martin Luther King gets the better of that argument.</p><p end="3144" is_meta="true" speaker="Alan Dershowitz" start="3091">applause</p><p end="3144" is_meta="false" speaker="David Kopel" start="3091">-- those who want -- the majorities that want to oppress minorities like the Ku Klux Klan with local police connivance, they're always going to have arms and I applaud your presence in the south. You perhaps might not have been on the summer March from Mississippi to Memphis led by Dr. King where the Deacons for Defense were there and,</p><p end="3144" is_meta="false" speaker="David Kopel" start="3091">in fact, were providing personal security for Dr. King himself.</p><p end="3144" is_meta="false" speaker="Alan Dershowitz" start="3091">And how did that end up for Dr. King?</p><p end="3144" is_meta="false" speaker="David Kopel" start="3091">Huh?</p><p end="3144" is_meta="false" speaker="Alan Dershowitz" start="3091">How did that end up for Dr. King? Not very well.</p><p end="3220" is_meta="false" speaker="David Kopel" start="3144">The availability of a gun.</p><p end="3220" is_meta="false" speaker="Eugene Volokh" start="3144">I don't understand what you're saying. The assassins are going to have the guns. The question is whether people ought to be able to have guns to defend themselves.</p><p end="3220" is_meta="false" speaker="Alan Dershowitz" start="3144">The assassins have an easier time getting the guns when they're easily available in society.</p><p end="3220" is_meta="false" speaker="Eugene Volokh" start="3144">How do you propose making it hard for an assassin in a country --</p><p end="3220" is_meta="true" speaker="Eugene Volokh" start="3144">applause</p><p end="3220" is_meta="false" speaker="Eugene Volokh" start="3144">How do you propose making it hard for a political assassin who is willing to throw away the rest of his life essentially for his act, making it hard for him to get a gun in a country where there are 300 million guns.</p><p end="3220" is_meta="false" speaker="Eugene Volokh" start="3144">Alan Dershowitz:That's the point. That there are 300 million guns. I want to live in a country where there are not 300 million guns.</p><p end="3264" is_meta="false" speaker="Sanford Levinson" start="3220">Okay. Ninety percent of the American public, rightly or wrongly, but 90 percent of the American public thought that the Senate should at least take a vote on enhancing background checks. It never got to the floor of the Senate. Last night I think the NRA invited people before the debate to chime in with their views, and I was told before we came out that the current vote is something like 43,000 against the motion and --</p><p end="3264" is_meta="false" speaker="Sanford Levinson" start="3220">Yes.</p><p end="3329" is_meta="false" speaker="Sanford Levinson" start="3264">The strongest argument for substantive constitutional rights is when you believe that a vulnerable minority is likely to be victimized by what Americans learned to call "the tyranny of the majority." Whatever your views are on gun control, at least right now --</p><p end="3329" is_meta="false" speaker="Sanford Levinson" start="3264">and throughout most of American history -- it is so wildly unlikely that the -- however many people own the 300 million guns -- because most people who own guns, I think,</p><p end="3329" is_meta="false" speaker="Sanford Levinson" start="3264">own multiple guns -- that they are comparable to Jehovah&#8217;s Witnesses, say, or some other vulnerable minority that they need the special concern of judges, basically, to make up public policy for the entire country.</p><p end="3382" is_meta="false" speaker="David Kopel" start="3329">So --</p><p end="3382" is_meta="false" speaker="David Kopel" start="3329">Sure.</p><p end="3382" is_meta="false" speaker="David Kopel" start="3329">Constitutional rights are not only for persecuted minorities. I don't think ABC, CBS, the New York Times, and the New York Daily News are comparable to Jehovah's Witnesses either. And it's very important that there be a strong First Amendment to protect them.</p><p end="3382" is_meta="false" speaker="David Kopel" start="3329">And in Nebraska, where the right to arms is culturally strong, the Second Amendment is still necessary for exactly one of the issues you raised -- the right of legal permanent resident aliens to obtain concealed carry permits to carry handguns for lawful protection as law-abiding American citizens can do.</p><p end="3444" is_meta="false" speaker="David Kopel" start="3382">And unfortunately, there are in this large and diverse country just about anything that you can say is nationally popular is going to be nationally unpopular with some local group of people who don't celebrate diversity and respect all rights. And in places like New York City and San Francisco and Chicago, with their irrationally extreme anti-gun administrations -- absolutely the Second Amendment --</p><p end="3444" is_meta="false" speaker="David Kopel" start="3382">-- [inaudible] --</p><p end="3444" is_meta="false" speaker="David Kopel" start="3382">People in Washington DC would have no right to defend themselves in their home against a violent home intruder, for example.</p><p end="3444" is_meta="false" speaker="Alan Dershowitz" start="3382">Even if they voted that way -- this is interesting. What you're --</p><p end="3444" is_meta="false" speaker="Alan Dershowitz" start="3382">-- in argument for diversity, that would deny the people of New York the right to show their diversity by saying, "We don't want to be like Montana.

Again, what everyone's views are about gun rights in the United States -- there's something strange in referring to them as a human right, because -- and here's, I think, where Alan's point comes home -- it really is quite remarkable that among the roughly 190 countries or so that are currently in the U.N., there are a grand total of four that recognize some kind of constitutionalized right to bear arms. And you discover that the Mexican constitution allows reasonable regulation. So, it may be -- I mean, this is -- again, topic for a different sort of conversation -- it may be that there is something about American culture that recognizes that it is a right within the United States.</p><p end="3627" is_meta="false" speaker="Sanford Levinson" start="3569">It's part of American exceptionalism that guns are treated much more seriously than anywhere else in the world, but human rights arguments really do have a universalistic overtone.

I think that's what David means.</p><p end="3627" is_meta="false" speaker="Sanford Levinson" start="3569">No. I'm talking about -- no. I'm not making that argument. I'm simply talking about nomenclature that it's one thing to say we in America are committed to certain rights,</p><p end="3627" is_meta="false" speaker="Sanford Levinson" start="3569">some of which look very, very odd to the rest of the world.

We have much stronger rules against the establishment of religion than most other countries do, but I think the fact that many countries have gone away from what was traditionally their respect for much of their history of the right to arms and of the right of self-defense, does not denigrate that right from it existing at all as a human right.

Your opponent -- speaking out to the side that's arguing that The Constitutional Right to Bear Arms has Outlived Its Usefulness, your opponent said well, you know, the constitution -- the amendment may be there, the right to bear arms may be enshrined in the law, but that doesn't mean that you can't limit gun control.</p><p end="3804" is_meta="false" speaker="Alan Dershowitz" start="3749">That, in fact, the Heller decision specified all sorts of situations, guns in the hands of mentally ill people, felons, et cetera, that as it is your hands aren't tied, in fact, to effect gun ownership laws in the United States, and I just want to have you respond to that and then hear what your opponent says in response.</p><p end="3872" is_meta="false" speaker="Sanford Levinson" start="3804">You know, I agree with that.</p><p end="3872" is_meta="false" speaker="Sanford Levinson" start="3804">Most Americans, if you poll them, believe a) that there is some kind of fundamental individual right to own firearms, and b) that there ought to be reasonable regulation.</p><p end="3872" is_meta="false" speaker="Sanford Levinson" start="3804">So, the question is who ought to decide at the end of the day what counts as reasonable regulation? I believe precisely because there's so much difference -- good faith difference of opinion, that this is an America of the 21st Century, a subject for legislative resolution. You won't like some of the particular solutions, but that's what federalism and political diversity is about. But none of us on this panel is arguing that the state can never ever limit guns, and at least as a political preference, neither Alan nor I would support in the United States in the 21st Century a proposal to ban any and all firearms,</p><p end="3872" is_meta="false" speaker="Sanford Levinson" start="3804">but we're talking about reasonable regulation and who ought to make reasonable regulation.</p><p end="3930" is_meta="false" speaker="Sanford Levinson" start="3872">Well, but there's a tension here, because -- I mean, for the first 200 years of our history,</p><p end="3930" is_meta="false" speaker="Sanford Levinson" start="3872">the Second Amendment really played no role in American constitutional law, if you define that as judicial decisions, especially at the national level. It's only been in the last six, seven years that it's played any role. So, the debate, in part, as well, should the Second Amendment now really be invigorated so that five to four majorities of the Supreme Court will decide whether or not Martha Stewart should be able to have a gunfor self-defense? And it appears, although Justice Scalia didn't offer even an iota of a reason -- that he said, "No, she doesn't get it." Or do you want these -- let's say, hashed out?</p><p end="3978" is_meta="false" speaker="Sanford Levinson" start="3930">Either the Second Amendment really has some genuine bite to it or it's an expressive aspect of the Constitution --</p><p end="3978" is_meta="false" speaker="Sanford Levinson" start="3930">-- as it has -- as it was for roughly for the first 200 years of our history.</p><p end="3978" is_meta="false" speaker="Eugene Volokh" start="3930">So let me answer Sandy's point, and working, also, a point he made about the background checks failing in Congress.</p><p end="4045" is_meta="false" speaker="Eugene Volokh" start="3978">My colleague, Adam Winkler at the UCLA Law School -- I don't think anybody would think as a hardcore NRA-supporting, Second Amendment maximalist -- I think made a very good argument that the thing that probably most defeated background checks was the proposed ban on the so-called assault weapons, which are semi-automatic weapons that are really functionally not much different than other kinds of weapons. But they were singled out for specific prohibition. He said that poisoned the well, that after assuring people, "Oh, we're not going to come to take your guns," people said, "Whoa,</p><p end="4045" is_meta="false" speaker="Eugene Volokh" start="3978">they are coming to take our guns." And that caused people to dig on. You're talking about the functions of individual rights. One of the functions of individual rights is to provide enough of a detente in these kinds of social battles, especially culture war battles, that a side could say, "Look, we're confident enough they're not coming to take our guns, that if what is on the table is a background check, it might pass just as it has passed in the past " -- in the early 90s. So, so, that's actually one advantage that the Second Amendment -- so securing an individual right.</p><p end="4106" is_meta="false" speaker="Eugene Volokh" start="4045">But more specifically, the call into question -- the quote is about the right to bear arms,</p><p end="4106" is_meta="false" speaker="Eugene Volokh" start="4045">specifically the right to bear arms being recognized as an individual right provides. If that were called into question, if that were repealed or people would say, "Well, we would repeal it if it weren't for our better political sensibilities," that's the sort of thing that would poison the well further. So if you want to actually get a background check passed,</p><p end="4106" is_meta="false" speaker="Eugene Volokh" start="4045">you're much better off with a Second Amendment respected and firmly recognized as part our Constitution, and then question and [unintelligible] said to be something that's ripe for repeal.</p><p end="4165" is_meta="false" speaker="David Kopel" start="4106">Well, to start with, it's normal defensive uses when you happen to be in a neighborhood that is politically powerless.</p><p end="4229" is_meta="false" speaker="David Kopel" start="4165">In Chicago, like a lot of places, there are some neighborhoods that have a very strong police presence and a strong deterrent effect, and there are other neighborhoods that,</p><p end="4229" is_meta="false" speaker="David Kopel" start="4165">for whatever reasons, get essentially very little protection. And when the government steps aside so that the rapists and thugs can do to you as they will, that is a form of at least of misgovernment, so people being able to protect themselves matters there. And you can look at the United States, fortunately, we don't need to protect ourselves against government in the sense that we were doing in 1776, but you can look around the world at the various tyrannies that exist and people sometimes using guns successfully protect themselves. Now I would point out, every genocidal government of the last century has assiduously disarmed the intended victims of genocide beforehand,</p><p end="4229" is_meta="false" speaker="David Kopel" start="4165">and you can say well, if you have handgun what good is that going to do you against a tank?</p><p end="4278" is_meta="false" speaker="David Kopel" start="4229">Well, they take the view, and they're the ones who are carrying out the genocide, they take the view that if there is any resistance, if even one of our -- out of 100 of our secret police were putting people on cattle cars gets shot, that could really mess up our genocide program.</p><p end="4341" is_meta="false" speaker="David Kopel" start="4278">Not presently, but nobody in the United States in 1760 thought they'd have to be fighting the British 15 years later, and nobody -- no sane person in Germany in 1930thought that the country would fall -- would within 30 years fall into the hands of genocidal maniacs.</p><p end="4341" is_meta="false" speaker="Alan Dershowitz" start="4278">Well, how do you explain the fact that the highest ratio of opposition to free availability of guns are in the communities that have been subject to genocide? The Jewish community, the African American community, and other communities that have been subject to genocide are the ones that are most opposed to vigilante people in America having guns. There must be -- either you're smarter than they are or they're self-</p><p end="4341" is_meta="false" speaker="Alan Dershowitz" start="4278">interest is correct and you're wrong about genocide.</p><p end="4341" is_meta="false" speaker="David Kopel" start="4278">You are stereotyping those people. There's far more diversity --</p><p end="4341" is_meta="false" speaker="Alan Dershowitz" start="4278">I'm counting them.</p><p end="4341" is_meta="false" speaker="Alan Dershowitz" start="4278">I'm polling them.</p><p end="4341" is_meta="true" speaker="Alan Dershowitz" start="4278">applause</p><p end="4341" is_meta="false" speaker="Alan Dershowitz" start="4278">I'm saying majority wins.</p><p end="4341" is_meta="false" speaker="David Kopel" start="4278">And if you look at the public opinion polls of the black community, they support gun ownership as a principle. They support the Second Amendment and they actually have a favorable view --</p><p end="4407" is_meta="false" speaker="Alan Dershowitz" start="4341">At much lower ratio than White Anglo Saxon Protestants, right?</p><p end="4407" is_meta="false" speaker="David Kopel" start="4341">Blah, blah, blah. The point is --</p><p end="4407" is_meta="false" speaker="David Kopel" start="4341">So your point is blacks are pro NRA, but they're not as pro NRA as white people and therefore what?</p><p end="4407" is_meta="false" speaker="Alan Dershowitz" start="4341">Therefore it seems to me people know their own self-interests, and if you look at the ratio of people in various ethnic groups, I'm not stereotyping, as I say, I'm polling, you see that gun ownership favorability depends a great deal on cultural background, on background, historical background, and the very people that have been most subject to genocide are the very same people generally that seem to have a lower support for gun [unintelligible]</p><p end="4407" is_meta="false" speaker="Eugene Volokh" start="4341">Can I --</p><p end="4407" is_meta="true" speaker="Eugene Volokh" start="4341">talking simultaneously</p><p end="4407" is_meta="false" speaker="Eugene Volokh" start="4341">It has to do with his point about genocide.</p><p end="4407" is_meta="false" speaker="Eugene Volokh" start="4341">Can I offer a slightly different perspective?</p><p end="4407" is_meta="false" speaker="Eugene Volokh" start="4341">I actually, and this is directly related to the motion. I&#8217;m not sure to what extent today private gun ownership in a country like America would be effective in stopping government tyranny.</p><p end="4460" is_meta="false" speaker="Eugene Volokh" start="4407">There are plausible arguments that by making tyranny more costly it may make it less likely even if ultimately they get super-tyrannical they could crush all opposition.</p><p end="4460" is_meta="false" speaker="Eugene Volokh" start="4407">Plausible arguments to the contrary. But the question, recall, is whether the right to keep and bear arms has become obsolete. What I'm saying is, there used to be two main functions, one deterrence of government tyranny and one assurance of self-</p><p end="4460" is_meta="false" speaker="Eugene Volokh" start="4407">defense. It's possible that today the first function is not really achievable, but the second function is very much out there. I don't see the right as having become obsolete if one aspect of it, given changes in the structure of the military and the security apparatus and changes in modern weaponry, if that function is no longer usable, I'm not sure, but it may very well not be.</p><p end="4471" is_meta="false" speaker="Sanford Levinson" start="4460">I think we're dancing around the fact that --</p><p end="4471" is_meta="false" speaker="Sanford Levinson" start="4460">-- there are at least thousands, and maybe even a couple of million Americans who believe we do live in a tyranny, who are organized in militia movements.</p><p end="4528" is_meta="false" speaker="Sanford Levinson" start="4471">And all of the focus on self-defense and the idea that the Second Amendment -- the original Second Amendment is historically anachronistic, with regard to "Oh, everybody believes the current United States is just wonderful," there are some people -- I don't agree with them, in terms of their own politics, but there are some people who don't think it's wonderful and who want to drill and know how to use arms against the possibility of engaging in armed revolt. Now, do you support that as a protected Second Amendment right? That should be constitutional?</p><p end="4528" is_meta="false" speaker="Eugene Volokh" start="4471">I'm sorry. So --</p><p end="4528" is_meta="false" speaker="Eugene Volokh" start="4471">-- right to drill?</p><p end="4528" is_meta="false" speaker="Sanford Levinson" start="4471">Militias.</p><p end="4528" is_meta="false" speaker="Eugene Volokh" start="4471">-- [unintelligible] if it's a conspiracy to actually engage in revolution? No.</p><p end="4528" is_meta="false" speaker="Sanford Levinson" start="4471">No. Just to drill.</p><p end="4528" is_meta="false" speaker="Eugene Volokh" start="4471">Probably.</p><p end="4589" is_meta="false" speaker="Sanford Levinson" start="4528">You know, I think there's a deceptively easy answer --</p><p end="4589" is_meta="false" speaker="Sanford Levinson" start="4528">-- to your question. The 1787 Constitution did not include the Second Amendment. The Second Amendment, as Alan would emphasize, is part of the Bill of Rights that were added in 1791 at the behest of people who really were very suspicious of this new national government that was created by the Constitution.</p><p end="4646" is_meta="false" speaker="Sanford Levinson" start="4589">And, you know, one could quote Emerson or Walt Whitman, that the Constitution contains contradictions. And you have put your finger on a very key contradiction --</p><p end="4646" is_meta="false" speaker="David Kopel" start="4589">The Supreme Court justice Story --</p><p end="4646" is_meta="false" speaker="Alan Dershowitz" start="4589">Like in the Civil War.</p><p end="4646" is_meta="false" speaker="David Kopel" start="4589">That would be --</p><p end="4646" is_meta="false" speaker="Alan Dershowitz" start="4589">Like the Civil War, right?</p><p end="4646" is_meta="false" speaker="David Kopel" start="4589">The -- let me talk, please. That would be a restoration of constitutional order. That's what Justice Story's viewpoint is. It would be a dictatorship that was the insurrection,</p><p end="4646" is_meta="false" speaker="David Kopel" start="4589">that was lawless, that was at war with the Constitution.</p><p end="4729" is_meta="false" speaker="Alan Dershowitz" start="4646">So was the Civil War --</p><p end="4729" is_meta="false" speaker="Alan Dershowitz" start="4646">-- a legitimate [inaudible] --</p><p end="4729" is_meta="false" speaker="David Kopel" start="4646">No, no.</p><p end="4729" is_meta="false" speaker="David Kopel" start="4646">Yes.</p><p end="4729" is_meta="false" speaker="Eugene Volokh" start="4646">I have an answer to that.</p><p end="4729" is_meta="false" speaker="Eugene Volokh" start="4646">Which civil war? Do you mean the civil war against the federal government or the civil war that was fought between 1775 and 1781, in the U.S.?</p><p end="4729" is_meta="false" speaker="Alan Dershowitz" start="4646">No. The one that we all refer to the "Civil War."</p><p end="4729" is_meta="false" speaker="Eugene Volokh" start="4646">So, the answer is --</p><p end="4729" is_meta="false" speaker="Alan Dershowitz" start="4646">With a capital T, a capital C, and a capital W. A guy involving Abraham Lincoln.</p><p end="4729" is_meta="false" speaker="Alan Dershowitz" start="4646">Remember that one?</p><p end="4729" is_meta="false" speaker="Eugene Volokh" start="4646">So the answer --</p><p end="4729" is_meta="true" speaker="Eugene Volokh" start="4646">laughter</p><p end="4729" is_meta="false" speaker="Alan Dershowitz" start="4646">Was that a legitimate insurrection? That was lead by state militias.</p><p end="4729" is_meta="false" speaker="Eugene Volokh" start="4646">So the answer is --</p><p end="4729" is_meta="false" speaker="Eugene Volokh" start="4646">-- that we think the Revolutionary War was legitimate, partly because we were the ones on the winning side. But partly because we think it was a just insurrection; that we think the Civil War is illegitimate because it was an unjust insurrection. But to return to your question, it's an excellent question. But if you'll look at the framing era documents andthe post-framing documents -- and for that matter, the pre-framing documents, Sir William Blackstone's Commentaries on the Laws of England -- it was understood that while, obviously, every government must be able to suppress revolutions against it --</p><p end="4729" is_meta="false" speaker="Eugene Volokh" start="4646">and it will, whether it's a tyrannical government or not -- one merit that was seen at the time -- again, I'm skeptical about it today -- but without question, historically seen at the time in an armed citizenry is it would preferably deter tyranny, and if necessary,</p><p end="4729" is_meta="false" speaker="Eugene Volokh" start="4646">overthrow it, recognizing that if it fails, that they'll be hung -- hanged for treason. That was understood.</p><p end="4887" is_meta="false" speaker="Eugene Volokh" start="4823">Well, the question was asked --</p><p end="4887" is_meta="false" speaker="Eugene Volokh" start="4823">Well, I just want to say for the record I'm not sure of the factual assertions behind that question.</p><p end="4941" is_meta="false" speaker="David Kopel" start="4887">As your question recognizes, there's a wide variety of criminals with different intensities and motivation, and so a political assassin is sort of at the top of the scale in terms of long-term planning, and you can have other criminals who are much more casual.</p><p end="5004" is_meta="false" speaker="David Kopel" start="4941">So, one of the anti-gun control arguments is what you're referring to -- the futility thesis.</p><p end="5004" is_meta="false" speaker="David Kopel" start="4941">That nothing you do is ever going to stop criminals from having guns, and that is true for many criminals who are determined to get guns. Can you at the margins of, you know, 1 percent or 5 percent, delay when they get the gun, or can you also have laws that say well, we can't really shut down the black market, but we can say that if you're a convicted felon for a genuinely violent crime and you're found carrying a gun, that there's going to be a severe sentence and that -- the studies do show that has some deterrent effect on them carrying guns. So I think you can't --</p><p end="5070" is_meta="false" speaker="David Kopel" start="5004">I think Eugene is about to give you a quote, but the short answer is --[laughter]</p><p end="5070" is_meta="false" speaker="David Kopel" start="5004">Modern state constitutions say it in modern language, and so any one of those recent ones, Wisconsin, for example.</p><p end="5070" is_meta="false" speaker="Eugene Volokh" start="5004">So let me read to you the 1998 Wisconsin provision, which was close backed by then state Senator Russ Feingold, not exactly the most conservative of conservatives. It says,</p><p end="5070" is_meta="false" speaker="Eugene Volokh" start="5004">"The people have the right to keep and bear arms for security defense, hunting,</p><p end="5070" is_meta="false" speaker="Eugene Volokh" start="5004">recreation, or any other lawful purpose."</p><p end="5129" is_meta="false" speaker="Eugene Volokh" start="5070">So that's what Senator Feingold was willing to say. I actually don't think that the preamble today -- the militia clause today -- is terribly helpful. If I had to re-write it, I'd probably end up -- I wouldn't worry about the possible political blowback that might cause even more infringement on this issue. I probably would --</p><p end="5129" is_meta="false" speaker="Eugene Volokh" start="5070">Got it.</p><p end="5129" is_meta="false" speaker="Eugene Volokh" start="5070">So I probably wouldn't include it. And I actually wouldn't include hunting, recreation, or any other lawful purpose. I think that is something that could be left to the political process. But I think the people have the right to keep and bear arms for security and defense. I think Russell Feingold -- that's one of the few things that I'm going to agree with Russell Feingold on.</p><p end="5242" is_meta="false" speaker="David Kopel" start="5185">Those --</p><p end="5307" is_meta="false" speaker="Eugene Volokh" start="5242">And I should just say, not a single Second Amendment decision or state -- or decision under any of the 44 state constitutional rights to keep and bear arms contradict that or undermine the safety issue that you're raising. So, if, for example, a state court imposes liability because a gun is prone to misfiring or something like that, no constitutional problem. There's an interesting debate as to what the proper regulatory scheme for that is. But the Second Amendment is not an obstacle because --</p><p end="5307" is_meta="false" speaker="Alan Dershowitz" start="5242">Well, that's what you say. But just remember what --</p><p end="5307" is_meta="false" speaker="Alan Dershowitz" start="5242">-- David said. David said that he's going to mount a Second Amendment constitutional challenge to New York's law that prevents you from taking your gun out of the state. So,</p><p end="5307" is_meta="false" speaker="Alan Dershowitz" start="5242">there's always the threat, if there's a constitutional amendment, that every regulation will be challenged. The NRA thinks everything is unconstitutional -- locks on guns, safety provisions for guns, making sure guns are stored properly. The NRA can make a constitutional argument against any reasonable regulation. I think every --</p><p end="5371" is_meta="false" speaker="David Kopel" start="5307">And so could --</p><p end="5371" is_meta="false" speaker="Alan Dershowitz" start="5307">-- body has to --</p><p end="5371" is_meta="false" speaker="David Kopel" start="5307">-- the ACLU.</p><p end="5371" is_meta="false" speaker="Alan Dershowitz" start="5307">-- admit -- everybody has to admit that if there is a constitutional amendment, the presumption is against regulation. If there is no constitutional amendment, thepresumption is in favor of regulation. That's why we ought not to constitutionalize this right. We ought to constitutionalize the right of self-defense, but not the derivative right of gun ownership.</p><p end="5371" is_meta="false" speaker="Eugene Volokh" start="5307">Alan, this is like saying that the Fourth Amendment -- the problem with the Fourth Amendment is that every single criminal defendant can try to argue for reading it extra broadly and excluding all the evidence against them, and they do. And they lose.</p><p end="5371" is_meta="false" speaker="Alan Dershowitz" start="5307">They lose.</p><p end="5371" is_meta="false" speaker="Eugene Volokh" start="5307">We judge the Fourth Amendment by how it's actually been interpreted, rather than by some possibility that maybe it's going to be over-interpreted --</p><p end="5371" is_meta="false" speaker="Alan Dershowitz" start="5307">This is just the beginning.</p><p end="5371" is_meta="false" speaker="Eugene Volokh" start="5307">The Second Amendment? No. The right to keep and bear arms has been around -- as an individual right --</p><p end="5371" is_meta="false" speaker="Alan Dershowitz" start="5307">10 years --</p><p end="5371" is_meta="false" speaker="Eugene Volokh" start="5307">-- since 1776, at the state level --</p><p end="5371" is_meta="false" speaker="Eugene Volokh" start="5307">There are dozens -- there are dozens --</p><p end="5371" is_meta="false" speaker="Eugene Volokh" start="5307">-- of court decisions from the 1800s on to the 1900s into 2000s, interpreting it. None of them have had the effect of striking down any such laws.</p><p end="5435" is_meta="false" speaker="Sanford Levinson" start="5371">I think it's a legitimate question. That is to say --</p><p end="5435" is_meta="false" speaker="Sanford Levinson" start="5371">Justice Scalia, without presenting any argument, announced in Heller that just as Martha Stewart can be deprived of her right to self-defense, it apparently was the case that all laws limiting the rights of mentally ill people, a notoriously accordion-like term, could be limited.</p><p end="5487" is_meta="false" speaker="Sanford Levinson" start="5435">I presume that all of us agree there are some mentally ill people who shouldn't be allowed close to a gun. I would imagine that as a policy matter, not as a constitutional matter, all of us might well agree that there are some mentally ill people whom we would, in fact, allow to have a gun if we really do take self-defense very seriously. This --</p><p end="5487" is_meta="false" speaker="Sanford Levinson" start="5435">what you might want is legislators, city councils, et cetera, to write very careful legislation and tell us which is which, rather than to leave this up to judges who, quite frankly, have no training whatsoever in discerning differences of level of mental illness,</p><p end="5487" is_meta="false" speaker="Sanford Levinson" start="5435">or have no training in trying to figure out what, if anything, the data actually support.</p><p end="5665" is_meta="false" speaker="Eugene Volokh" start="5602">So, we've heard all sorts of things about death, about assassination, about futility. I want to end this on a cheerful note. I want to tell you about some good news. So, from 1993 on, the size -- the amount of guns in America increased from 200 million to probably about 300 million. Now, you might think that's good news or not, but that's not what I'm claiming is good news. Likewise, or since from the mid -- in the mid-'80sabout 10 states, any law abiding adult could carry a gun concealed on his person just by getting a license, except for one of the 10, you didn&#8217;t even need a license. That state, it turns out, was Vermont. Now that number is over 40. During that time, and I'm not going to say -- I'm not making a causal claim here, I will tell you the claim I'm making in a moment. During that time, the homicide rate and the firearms homicide rate, basically fell by a factor of two.</p><p end="5728" is_meta="false" speaker="Eugene Volokh" start="5665">The general violent crime rate and the gun violent crime rate basically fell by a factor of roughly three to four. I will tell you, the number -- it was so shocking, I thought it was just nonsense spread on the Internet. But if it is, it's spread on the Internet by the Bureau of Justice Statistics, so that gives it some special claim as nonsense goes. So --</p><p end="5728" is_meta="true" speaker="Eugene Volokh" start="5665">laughter</p><p end="5728" is_meta="false" speaker="Eugene Volokh" start="5665">-- I think it's probably not nonsense. The serious violent crime with guns against youths,</p><p end="5728" is_meta="false" speaker="Eugene Volokh" start="5665">age 12 to 17, fell by a factor of 20 -- by 95 percent. Now, I'm not saying that the growing gun stock caused-- that's -- there's actually a hot debate about that -- I don't know what the right answer is. But it seems to have happened in spite of the growing gun stock.</p><p end="5728" is_meta="false" speaker="Eugene Volokh" start="5665">We'd think, if some of the arguments we've heard are correct, the result would have been vast amount of bloodshed. It hasn't been. Something worked. We don't know what. Nobody really quite knows what. But something has caused this tremendous and sustained decline of crime. We should be looking to see what that was. It wasn't gun control, maybe it wasn't gun de-control. It was something. That's --</p><p end="5783" is_meta="false" speaker="Eugene Volokh" start="5728">-- what we should be thinking about --</p><p end="5783" is_meta="false" speaker="Eugene Volokh" start="5728">-- and not guns.</p><p end="5783" is_meta="false" speaker="Sanford Levinson" start="5728">All right. It's no surprise that my friend Eugene Volokh makes very, very powerful,</p><p end="5783" is_meta="false" speaker="Sanford Levinson" start="5728">eloquent arguments about the public policy of gun control. But that's not what we're debating this evening. The question is to what extent any particular policy should be constitutionalized, which at the national level, means that it's close to written in stone and impervious to any change in the future.</p><p end="5843" is_meta="false" speaker="Sanford Levinson" start="5783">And I really do think when you vote, that ought to be the principal question you're asking, not whether you believe a particular policy in 2013 makes sense, because if you constitutionalize it, you also have to say, "It's going to make sense in 2023, 2033, and ad infinitum." Secondly, I think David Kopel used interestingly different language at different points in his argument. And he, too, has made very capable arguments. I don't know him so well as I know Eugene, so you shouldn't take anything amiss when I don't refer to him as my friend.

Maybe he's got the wrong policy. But it seems to me that the rationality test -- at least the way that lawyers use it -- really does require that you believe the other side is truly lunatic.

He has conceded that he wouldn&#8217;t include a militia in his model Bill of Rights. He also has conceded that he wouldn&#8217;t constitutionalize the right of hunting. By making those two arguments, he has conceded the basic proposition: that the SecondAmendment the way it&#8217;s currently written is anachronistic and has outlived its usefulness. He would substitute another amendment for that, an amendment much like the one that he said was passed in Wisconsin. It seems to me that they have conceded away the basic argument, namely that the Second Amendment as written is anachronistic. What&#8217;s left?</p><p end="6146" is_meta="false" speaker="Alan Dershowitz" start="6081">What&#8217;s left is: do we really want militia groups that are armed today, and armed under the Second Amendment, to have the right to confront our government and try to conduct yet another revolution of the kind that we had back in the American Revolution and the Civil War? It seems to me the answer to that is quite clearly no. Sigmund Freud had a very famous statement back 100 years ago in which he said, &#8220;The first human who hurled an insult instead of a stone was the founder of civilization.&#8221; The First Amendment protects insults. It does not protect stones, it does not protect violence. We could live very comfortably with a First Amendment and without a Second Amendment. I don&#8217;t want to amend the Bill of Rights because I worry that other things could happen, but I do want to make it very clear that the Second Amendment with its emphasis on militias and hunting, and with no mention of self-defense has outlived its usefulness.</p><p end="6208" is_meta="false" speaker="Alan Dershowitz" start="6146">Therefore I urge you to vote yes and let&#8217;s begin a debate on whether we should have an amendment protecting the right of self-defense, not the right of guns.</p><p end="6208" is_meta="true" speaker="Alan Dershowitz" start="6146">applause</p></transcript></debate>
