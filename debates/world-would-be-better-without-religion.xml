Grayling" start="366">Yes, it's true. It's crazy.</p><p end="422" is_meta="false" speaker="A.C. Grayling" start="366">Yeah. It's crazy, but it's true.</p><p end="422" is_meta="false" speaker="A.C. Grayling" start="366">Thank you.</p><p end="422" is_meta="true" speaker="A.C. Grayling" start="366">applause</p><p end="422" is_meta="false" speaker="A.C. Grayling" start="366">John, thank you very much indeed. I must begin by asking you, if I may, to focus on what the proposition is before us. We're not here to discuss the existence of God. We are not here to discuss whether it's rational, irrational to have faith. We're here to discuss a sociological phenomenon, a man-made phenomenon, religion. You can see the difference. You might call in question whether or not gods and goddesses. But you can't call in question whether or not there is religion. There's plenty of it. History is full of it, and it exists around us all the time today. By the way, I say that religion is man-</p><p end="422" is_meta="false" speaker="A.C. Grayling" start="366">made advisedly.</p><p end="479" is_meta="false" speaker="A.C. Grayling" start="422">There are very few women indeed in the upper half of hierarchies of the world's religions, which perhaps has something to do with the point.[laughter]</p><p end="479" is_meta="false" speaker="A.C. Grayling" start="422">Now, religions are very diverse in nature. They have different interpretations of their deities. They say different things about what we can wear and what we can eat and when, how many wives we can have, what rituals we must follow. Despite the fact that they all take the view that they've got the right story, they differ from one another quite dramatically in a number of respects. And this is why, through the course of history,</p><p end="479" is_meta="false" speaker="A.C. Grayling" start="422">they've burdened mankind with a huge number of conflicts and a great deal of divisiveness. But I'm not going to bore you by rehearsing the story of crusades and inquisitions and the rest. It's a very familiar matter. Although it is, of course, in the interests of apologists of religions to try to forget them. Rather, I wanted to talk about things that religions have in common with one another rather than the things that divide them. They have two things in common with one another.</p><p end="552" is_meta="false" speaker="A.C. Grayling" start="479">Most of the time in history, and among many of the orthodox manifestations of religion today, they are similar to one another in -- most of them, giving second-class status to women and being hostile to gays, in being very opposed to most kinds of progress,</p><p end="552" is_meta="false" speaker="A.C. Grayling" start="479">especially scientific progress. The reason being, of course, that they take it that they received the truth a long time ago, anything between one and 3,000 years ago. And so things that are challenging and are new and offer us different views of the world, they find unpalatable. And so they tend to be very traditionalist, very conservative and rather retrogressive. And that explains a great deal of the social policy and political endeavor that the religions engage in. That's one thing that they tend to have in common with one another.</p><p end="552" is_meta="false" speaker="A.C. Grayling" start="479">But another thing they have in common with one another, a very important point, is that they share a structural feature. In fact, they are -- the religions are paradigmatic of a certain kind of organization, what I call a monolithic ideology, a one-size-fits all, top-</p><p end="552" is_meta="false" speaker="A.C. Grayling" start="479">down, totalizing ideology which says we've got the right story, and you've got to sign up for it.</p><p end="598" is_meta="false" speaker="A.C. Grayling" start="552">If you don't sign up for our story, if you don't agree, you are going to pay a sanction of one kind or another. And during the course of history, those sanctions have sometimes been very terrible. It's in this respect in which religions in history and in their orthodox manifestations now, plus in all their manifestations, tend to share with other kinds of totalizing ideologies. So that's why it's no great surprise that Joseph Stalin, for example,</p><p end="598" is_meta="false" speaker="A.C. Grayling" start="552">was educated in the seminary. What those totalitarianisms share is very, very common.</p><p end="598" is_meta="false" speaker="A.C. Grayling" start="552">[unintelligible] inquisition in Spain in the 15th century and Stalin's Soviet Union in the20th century say the same thing, "We've got the answer, you've got to agree, and if you don't, you're in trouble."</p><p end="657" is_meta="false" speaker="A.C. Grayling" start="598">So they have these two features, and the second of them, the structural feature, the idea of being in charge of the truth or of possessing the right story about life in the universe is very opposed to the enlightenment outlook on which our modern Western liberal democracies are based, the enlightenment of the 18th century taught us to think that there isn't one right answer for everybody. It taught us pluralism, taught us individual autonomy, it taught us liberty of conscience, it taught us democracy.</p><p end="657" is_meta="false" speaker="A.C. Grayling" start="598">Democracy is about people having a conversation, the great conversation of society in which we negotiate with one another about how we go forward, how we organize ourselves in society, and that's very different indeed from thinking that there is one great ruler, one monarch, whether in the sky or on the ground, who tells us what we should do, and that we mustn't think for ourselves, but we must all be orthodox, and indeed this ethical point is a very important one.</p><p end="721" is_meta="false" speaker="A.C. Grayling" start="657">There are those people who think that you can't have religion -- you can't have morality without religion, and of course, that isn't true. Everything good about religious morality,</p><p end="721" is_meta="false" speaker="A.C. Grayling" start="657">loving your neighbor, kindness, concern for others, responsibility as a member of the community, is shared by nonreligious ethical outlooks also. They're very common to all the great ethical theories. I'm an atheist and a humanist, and those values matter deeply to me. If you look at ancient Greek philosophy for example, a dominant strain of thought for nearly 1,000 years before Christianity came to command the mind of Europe, and you see that those values were shared by those thinkers, not because they thought they were told them by a deity but because reason and human experience had offered it to them. And the final point is this. People say, "What's wrong with moderate religion?" you know, those nice folks who go to church on Sundays and who take part in their neighborhoods. And here's the problem with that, moderate religion is religion where people do a little bit of cherry picking.</p><p end="779" is_meta="false" speaker="A.C. Grayling" start="721">They take the best bits of the religion, and some of the more embarrassing, or difficult,</p><p end="779" is_meta="false" speaker="A.C. Grayling" start="721">or awkward, or rebarbative bits they leave to one side. I know very, very few Christians who give away all they own to the poor, who take no thought for tomorrow, who turn their backs on their families if their families disagree and families are going to disagree if they do give away everything, who don't marry, who stay celibate. I find very few Christians actually live the New Testament morality, they cherry pick. Unkind people would call that "hypocrisy." At the other end of the scale, however, are those who take their religion extremely seriously, the extremists, we call it them. The point about theextremists is that they are the most honest of the people who have a religious view because they commit themselves to what their tradition tells them, and they stay closest to the text. Now, if that's real religion, that's honest religion, the world is very much better off without it.</p><p end="847" is_meta="false" speaker="A.C. Grayling" start="779">And if the world is much better off without the true and the honest form of religion,</p><p end="847" is_meta="false" speaker="A.C. Grayling" start="779">why not put the hypocrites in with them, too? Thank you.</p><p end="847" is_meta="true" speaker="A.C. Grayling" start="779">laughter</p><p end="847" is_meta="true" speaker="A.C. Grayling" start="779">applause</p><p end="847" is_meta="false" speaker="Rabbi David Wolpe" start="779">I hope we're not voting on that tonight.</p><p end="847" is_meta="false" speaker="Rabbi David Wolpe" start="779">Oh, yes. Yeah, stadiums, playoffs, National league, American league.</p><p end="847" is_meta="false" speaker="Rabbi David Wolpe" start="779">Thank you.</p><p end="1324" is_meta="false" speaker="Matthew Chapman" start="1265">My great-great-grandfather on my mother's side, yes.</p><p end="1803" is_meta="false" speaker="Dinesh D'Souza" start="1740">Thank you.</p><p end="1803" is_meta="false" speaker="Dinesh D'Souza" start="1740">[applause]It's my peculiar fate in this debate to be speaking last and therefore to have to digest the statements of the other speakers. I must say this puts me an odd position. I feel a bit like the mosquito in a nudist colony. I'm not sure where to begin.</p><p end="1803" is_meta="true" speaker="Dinesh D'Souza" start="1740">laughter</p><p end="1803" is_meta="false" speaker="Dinesh D'Souza" start="1740">I guess I'll begin by noting that there were two definitions that have been advanced by the other side that actually I think help our case. The first one is the idea that people who have religious beliefs are hypocritical. But notice that in making this accusation what was being alleged is that religious believers have ideals higher than they can live up to.</p><p end="1863" is_meta="false" speaker="Dinesh D'Souza" start="1803">And this is advanced as hypocrisy, in other words, holding up to a standard and falling short of it. Now, that is actually not hypocrisy. If you read the Bible, Jesus doesn't call people hypocrites because their ideals are too high. He calls people hypocrites who pretend to be one thing and are really another. The problem with the Pharisees wasn't that they had high principles, is that they didn't have principles but they pretended to be something they weren't, so we've seen a subtle shift in the meaning of hypocrisy, a shift that is advanced by the atheist side, why? To basically pull down the moral ideals that we hold up that are higher than ourselves. That I would suggest is a very bad thing.</p><p end="1863" is_meta="false" speaker="Dinesh D'Souza" start="1803">Now, Matthew made the argument that religion is a function of where you're born. If you were born in India, you're going to be a Hindu -- actually I was born in India, I was raised Catholic, but never mind -- that your religious identity is formed as a result of where you're born.</p><p end="1918" is_meta="false" speaker="Dinesh D'Souza" start="1863">If you're born in Afghanistan you're a Muslim and so on. Well I think this applies to all our beliefs. Let's say for example that somebody born in Oxford, England is more likely to subscribe to the theory of evolution than someone born in Oxford, Mississippi.</p><p end="1918" is_meta="false" speaker="Dinesh D'Souza" start="1863">Somebody who is born in New York City is more likely to have formed Einstein's theory of relativity than someone born in New Guinea. Now what does that say about whether evolution and relativity are true? Nothing. The fact of your birth is irrelevant to the merit of the idea, so there's a kind of sleight of hand here, you have to judge the ideas by their own merits. Now, would the world be better without religion? You can't answer that question without looking to see what religion has done in the world, but you've got to compare it to what the world would be like without religion.</p><p end="1986" is_meta="false" speaker="Dinesh D'Souza" start="1918">There's been some allusion to the boring crimes of religion, but let me suggest that those crimes, even the worst of them, are infinitesimal compared to the crimes ofatheist regimes that are far greater in magnitude, far longer in duration, and actually are still going on. If you consider, for example, a tragedy like the inquisition, a crime, I admit it, and yet over 400 years the Spanish Inquisition killed fewer than 2,000 people, 2,000.</p><p end="1986" is_meta="false" speaker="Dinesh D'Souza" start="1918">The Salem Witch Trials I heard about when I came to America, and then my wife and I a few years ago went to Salem, Massachusetts, it's a really interesting place -- I do want to report, the witches today are doing great, most of them are tourist guides -- but if you pick up one of their brochures, the number of people killed in the Salem Witch Trials,</p><p end="1986" is_meta="false" speaker="Dinesh D'Souza" start="1918">19, 19. Now, is that 19 too many? Yeah, or if you want to add it up, 2,019. But while the atheists cry inconsolable crocodile tears over the crimes of religion, they ignore the vastly greater crimes of atheism.</p><p end="2046" is_meta="false" speaker="Dinesh D'Souza" start="1986">Now, am I talking about Stalin in Russia and Mao in China? Not even really, that's just the tip of the atheist iceberg. If you dig deeper, there is a massive procession underneath. In the Soviet Union alone, starting with Lenin you continue through Brezhnev, Andropov, Chernenko, a procession of Soviet dictators, but what about Ceausescu and [unintelligible], Fidel Castro, Kim Jong Il, Pol Pot, I mean, Pol Pot is such a junior league atheist people don't even mention him.</p><p end="2046" is_meta="true" speaker="Dinesh D'Souza" start="1986">laughter</p><p end="2046" is_meta="false" speaker="Dinesh D'Souza" start="1986">And yet in the aftermath of the Vietnam War, his Khmer Rouge regime in the space of about three years managed to kill two million people, two million. Even bin Laden in his wildest dreams has not even come close, but who should parachute into the discussion at this critical moment but Richard Dawkins in his book, "The God Delusion," and he goes, "Wait a minute. We've got to make a crucial distinction here."</p><p end="2102" is_meta="false" speaker="Dinesh D'Souza" start="2046">You might've had some tyrants who killed -- who happened to be atheist, but they didn't kill in the name of atheism. The Christians killed in the name of Christianity. Now,</p><p end="2102" is_meta="false" speaker="Dinesh D'Souza" start="2046">Richard Dawkins is a respected biologist, and I think here you begin to see the problem,</p><p end="2102" is_meta="false" speaker="Dinesh D'Souza" start="2046">when a biologist is allowed to leave the laboratory.</p><p end="2102" is_meta="true" speaker="Dinesh D'Souza" start="2046">laughter</p><p end="2102" is_meta="false" speaker="Dinesh D'Souza" start="2046">Why? Because evidently the poor man knows no history, all you have to do is crack open the collected works of Karl Marx, and you will see that the atheism is not incidental, it's not some add on, it's intrinsic to the whole ideological scheme, Marx famously calls religion, the opium, a kind of drug of the masses. And his point is you&#8217;ve got to get rid of religion in order to establish the new man and the new Utopia freed from the shackles of traditional religion and traditional morality.</p><p end="2161" is_meta="false" speaker="Dinesh D'Souza" start="2102">Often when we think of secular society, we think of Europe. But Europe isn&#8217;t really secular. Europe is a product of 2,000 years of Jewish and Christian civilization. Even today if there&#8217;s a famine in Rwanda, while much of the world ignores it, the European countries, the Western countries begin to send to food and aid, Doctors without Borders, the Red Cross. My point is this is the result of a religious training and a religious habit of mind that remains. Nietzsche once said that if we get rid of God,</p><p end="2161" is_meta="false" speaker="Dinesh D'Souza" start="2102">we&#8217;ve got to get rid of shadows of God. In other words, the ideas that Judaism and Christianity brought into the West and into the world, those will begin to erode as well.</p><p end="2161" is_meta="false" speaker="Dinesh D'Souza" start="2102">Dostoevsky said a long time ago, &#8220;If God is not, everything is permitted.&#8221; And Dostoevsky&#8217;s point is that when we get rid of transcendence, when we create a world without religion, we license terrible calamities.</p><p end="2225" is_meta="false" speaker="Dinesh D'Souza" start="2161">So, in the names of the thousands and hundreds of thousands, perhaps millions of souls who have died, I would say from their point of view, the world would have been a lot better off if it had religion. Thank you.</p><p end="2225" is_meta="true" speaker="Dinesh D'Souza" start="2161">applause</p><p end="2345" is_meta="false" speaker="A.C. Grayling" start="2280">Well, first, of course, Matthew is right to point out that the religion that anybody has,</p><p end="2345" is_meta="false" speaker="A.C. Grayling" start="2280">tends, on the whole -- in much more than 95 percent of cases to be the religion of your parents. And so, it&#8217;s a traditional thing. People are brought up in the religion of their father, and it&#8217;s historical.</p><p end="2407" is_meta="false" speaker="A.C. Grayling" start="2345">But you asked me the question.</p><p end="2407" is_meta="false" speaker="A.C. Grayling" start="2345">Okay, so I repeat the answer, which is, of course, religion is pervasive in history at its traditional -- it&#8217;s handed down from parents to their children so it remains the case that it&#8217;s a very potent force in society. But if you look at the trend in the developed and advanced and educated countries of the world, mainly the Western countries, since the 17th and 18th century, enlightenment and the growth of science, you see the numbers are plummeting. They are plummeting even here in the United States of America. You look at the few polling data and it points out to us that the number of people who self-</p><p end="2407" is_meta="false" speaker="A.C. Grayling" start="2345">identify as not having a religious commitment or agnostic or atheist is increasing all the time, especially among the young. So the trends are setting in the right direction.</p><p end="2460" is_meta="false" speaker="Dinesh D'Souza" start="2407">Sure. Remember, we also get kids early with habits like brushing your teeth, learning the mathematical tables. Now, here is the point. I think that as a practical matter, we all learn our ethical values from our parents. I learned what I would call &#8220;crayon Christianity&#8221; from my parents. But the fact of the matter is that's my parents' beliefs.</p><p end="2460" is_meta="false" speaker="Dinesh D'Souza" start="2407">When I became a teenager, when I went to Dartmouth, that set of beliefs got battered,</p><p end="2460" is_meta="false" speaker="Dinesh D'Souza" start="2407">and crayon Christianity became no Christianity at all. So it was in adult life that I had to go back to the ideas that had been bred in me as a child and ask, which of my parents'</p><p end="2460" is_meta="false" speaker="Dinesh D'Souza" start="2407">beliefs do I agree with?</p><p end="2522" is_meta="false" speaker="Dinesh D'Souza" start="2460">I do.</p><p end="2522" is_meta="false" speaker="Dinesh D'Souza" start="2460">Well, I think we're making a deep mistake here because just to say we learned it from our parents misses the thrust of why billions of people in the world continue to do it long into old age. In other words, religion delivers practical benefits. It gives us the hope of life after death. You might say that's an illusion, but you don't know. None of us knows what comes after death. We all have to die in any case. Either we die with despair facing annihilation, or we have the hope of something else. That's a practical benefit. Second, religion is a mode of transmission of morality. You might say there is morality that comes through Kant or Nietzsche or Heidegger.</p><p end="2591" is_meta="false" speaker="Dinesh D'Souza" start="2522">But no one teaches their kids morality that way. People learn their morality --</p><p end="2591" is_meta="false" speaker="Matthew Chapman" start="2522">Well, I just think it's a distortion of what you actually see in life, which is you see people who grow up in cultures. They become addicted to their particular religions. They disagree with all kinds of other religions. Even you, you started as a Catholic. You end up as an evangelical. Does that mean that you then say the stuff in the Catholic part of it was actually wrong, and you were mistaken about that? I think all of this is frankly delusional and that even if you could remove all of the bad things about religion and keep all of the good things in religion, none of which can't be performed by people who don't believe in God because they can. But even if you could remove all of the bad things from religion, and you ended up with a character who is like Father Christmas, a nice harmless sort of person, would you want to find out that the president of the United States was a devout believer in Father Christmas?</p><p end="2641" is_meta="false" speaker="Matthew Chapman" start="2591">Not me.</p><p end="2641" is_meta="false" speaker="Rabbi David Wolpe" start="2591">So I want to say, first of all, it's so interesting that the side that's quoting the Bible is that side and the side that has actually provided evidence of any kind is this side. So let me give you another piece of evidence as opposed to the generalities. In their Encyclopedia of Wars, okay, the Encyclopedia of Wars, Charles Phillips and Alan Axelrod, they chronicle over 1700 serious conflicts throughout history. Do you want to know what percentage actually reduced to religious wars? Seven percent.</p><p end="2641" is_meta="false" speaker="Rabbi David Wolpe" start="2591">The reason I'm saying this is because it's not about credulity. No, it's not about credulity.</p><p end="2701" is_meta="false" speaker="Rabbi David Wolpe" start="2641">The idea that people who are religious are religious because of some psychological deficit, but people who are not religious are not religious because they reason their way to the lack of religion, not only slights the idea that religious people are capable of thought, but also tries to sort of railroad into this belief that you should condemn it without actually looking at all the statistics, the ideas, the history that we cited. And that sort of slighting of the religious belief makes me think that your argument might not be as sound as you think it is.</p><p end="2701" is_meta="false" speaker="A.C. Grayling" start="2641">Can I come back to that? I hear a certain kind of incoherence on the other side there.</p><p end="2701" is_meta="false" speaker="A.C. Grayling" start="2641">Firstly, if you're religious, you live longer, that puzzles me. I mean, isn't heaven meant to be a nice place? It's always been --</p><p end="2701" is_meta="true" speaker="A.C. Grayling" start="2641">laughter</p><p end="2763" is_meta="false" speaker="A.C. Grayling" start="2701">-- from division.</p><p end="2763" is_meta="false" speaker="Dinesh D'Souza" start="2701">A.C. said earlier that the defining feature of religion is hierarchy and exclusivity. And I think that on both these, he's giving a very narrow and ethno-centric definition. First of all, Christianity is the only religion in the world that considers another religion, Judaism,</p><p end="2763" is_meta="false" speaker="Dinesh D'Souza" start="2701">to be wholly true. Hinduism considers all other religions to be wholly true.</p><p end="2827" is_meta="false" speaker="Dinesh D'Souza" start="2763">There's no sense in the Eastern religions of this hierarchy of this exclusivity. So we're seeing here not an attack on religion, but on a very slice of religion, perhaps fundamentalist religion. I think the deeper point here is this: And that is that the religious guy and the nonreligious guy are both responding to the world as it is. Charles Darwin became an atheist not because he discovered evolution. It wasn't facts. It was when his daughter, Annie, died. And Charles Darwin said, "If there's a hell, lots of the lovely people I know would be in it. I can't bear that kind of a doctrine." You, Matthew,</p><p end="2827" is_meta="false" speaker="Dinesh D'Souza" start="2763">in your article in Slate magazine talked about nuns or teachers who beat you on theankles and people -- people who stuck their hands down your pants. My point is, in many cases, we're not dealing with facts. We're dealing with wounded theism. Many times when we heard the word "atheism," we're dealing with a person who is angry with God or angry maybe with the representative, the self-appointed representative of God.</p><p end="2885" is_meta="false" speaker="Dinesh D'Souza" start="2827">That's not real atheism. They too are conducting, if you will, an ideological war,</p><p end="2885" is_meta="false" speaker="Dinesh D'Souza" start="2827">otherwise they wouldn't --</p><p end="2885" is_meta="false" speaker="Dinesh D'Souza" start="2827">-- be here.</p><p end="2885" is_meta="false" speaker="Matthew Chapman" start="2827">How can you be angry with somebody that doesn't exist? I'm angry with Dinesh because he's making these preposterous statements about my --</p><p end="2885" is_meta="false" speaker="Dinesh D'Souza" start="2827">Well, I didn't put my hand down your pants.</p><p end="2885" is_meta="false" speaker="Matthew Chapman" start="2827">-- great-great-grandfather--</p><p end="2885" is_meta="true" speaker="Matthew Chapman" start="2827">laughter</p><p end="2885" is_meta="false" speaker="Matthew Chapman" start="2827">-- that are simply not true. His atheism didn't come solely from the fact that his daughter died. It was a very slow process of seeing how the theory of evolution was in conflict with the Bible. And I think the point I would make is, let's give the religious people that at some point in history, religion was helpful, that it did make people do better things. But that the texts that the religions are based upon are archaic, absurd,</p><p end="2885" is_meta="false" speaker="Matthew Chapman" start="2827">cruel, open to interpretation.</p><p end="2945" is_meta="false" speaker="Matthew Chapman" start="2885">And frankly, there are better ways of conducting yourself in life. There are. And people like myself and Anthony here, we don't find a problem with being moral without God.</p><p end="2945" is_meta="false" speaker="Matthew Chapman" start="2885">And I don't buy in argument that we've inherited it from Christianity because if you look at the sort of evolutionary world, empathy and cooperation, compassion clearly existed before God decided, for some unknown reason, [unintelligible].</p><p end="2945" is_meta="false" speaker="Rabbi David Wolpe" start="2885">I'm not a literalist, no. But what I find very interesting is that the leap that Matthew's making -- he says these texts have cruel things. There are better ways to behalf. But we're asking not would the world be better off if you rewrote the Bible, but would the world be better off without the influence that religion has on religious people.</p><p end="3001" is_meta="false" speaker="Rabbi David Wolpe" start="2945">And I tried again and again to say this is what religious people do. This is what religious people do. This is what religious people do only to get back, "But look at the terrible text." And I want to say, in response to what Anthony said, I have the exact opposite experience. I actually think that if you believe that people are fundamentally good, and if you leave them alone, they're just going to be good, then you've never visited a playground, because my experience is when a new kid comes to the playground, the other kids don't go, "Oh, look, a new child. Let us embrace him and share our toys."</p><p end="3001" is_meta="true" speaker="Rabbi David Wolpe" start="2945">laughter</p><p end="3001" is_meta="false" speaker="Rabbi David Wolpe" start="2945">Actually, children have to be socialized to good. They do. And it takes a lot of work. If any of you are parents, do you have to tell your kid, "Don't share so much, don't be so nice." No, quite the opposite. And that work is difficult work and constant work and that's what religious communities do.</p><p end="3060" is_meta="false" speaker="Rabbi David Wolpe" start="3001">Do they ever do harm? Of course they sometimes do harm. Are there texts I don't like?</p><p end="3060" is_meta="false" speaker="Rabbi David Wolpe" start="3001">Of course, but the coda to this is, this idea that religious people are thoughtless automatons that follow what the text says, does violence to everything I know aboutreligious training, about religious leaders, about religious people, and by the way about the fact that we're having a debate like this tonight.</p><p end="3060" is_meta="false" speaker="Matthew Chapman" start="3001">I would like to --</p><p end="3060" is_meta="false" speaker="Matthew Chapman" start="3001">-- because I think what he's saying is this is the viewpoint of a rabbi who does work in an affluent community in Los Angeles. Both these men are very sophisticated. The people I met in Pennsylvania, who 50 percent of them believe in creationism and are fundamentalists, are people -- these people, they ignore. They're saying we ignore their sophistication. I'm saying they ignore the fact that most of the world is fundamentalist and takes a barbaric view of many of the text.</p><p end="3121" is_meta="false" speaker="Matthew Chapman" start="3060">Well, the harm is absolutely enormous, I mean, 50 percent -- I mean, just to be practical about it -- 50 percent of the growth of the American economy since World War II has come from science and technology. And this anti-scientism is gradually eroding America's ability to produce enterprising, educated --</p><p end="3121" is_meta="false" speaker="Dinesh D'Souza" start="3060">First of all, if you want to make a list of the 200 greatest scientists of all time from Newton, Copernicus, Kepler, Pascal, Gassindi, Boyle, the list goes on, you find that the vast, vast majority of them were religious believers.</p><p end="3183" is_meta="false" speaker="Dinesh D'Souza" start="3121">Moreover, it's not an accident that science did not develop universally. It developed in Western civilization. Why is that? Because in Western civilization, there is an embedded religious idea, and that is the idea of the rational cosmos. The Muslim philosopher Al-Ghazali denies that the universe operates by laws. He says, "Everything happens because Allah wills it at every given moment," that's why science didn't develop in the Muslim world. It's the sense of the whimsical, the miraculous universe.</p><p end="3183" is_meta="false" speaker="Dinesh D'Souza" start="3121">The point I'm trying to get at here is that on the basis of, I would say, a one percent minority of religious rednecks, we have an indictment of all the world's religions as a whole.</p><p end="3183" is_meta="false" speaker="Dinesh D'Souza" start="3121">Nothing could be more crude and shameful than to imply that Athens and Jerusalem which have given rise to Western civilization, that have shaped our philosophy, our economy, separation of powers, checks, and balances, when Thomas Jefferson, who --</p><p end="3241" is_meta="false" speaker="A.C. Grayling" start="3183">Yeah, sorry, I mean there are two things, Dinesh, with great respect to you, you are the most tremendous rewriter of history I've ever come across in my life.</p><p end="3241" is_meta="true" speaker="A.C. Grayling" start="3183">laughter</p><p end="3241" is_meta="true" speaker="A.C. Grayling" start="3183">applause</p><p end="3241" is_meta="false" speaker="A.C. Grayling" start="3183">You don't seem to be conscious of the fact that when Christianity became dominant in Europe in about the third, fourth century A.D. it looked at its sundial, the perusing [spelled phonetically] of the second coming of the Messiah hadn't happened, they needed some extra ethics. The ethics of the New Testament and the Napoleon epistles are very thin, they're the stuff I talked about earlier, give everything away, don't get married, don't bother about tomorrow. Where did they get it from? They got it from Greek philosophy. Most of European culture, and that means culture of the West, is deeply rooted in classical antiquity, in the thinking of Socrates, and Aristotle, and the stoics. That is where our European outlook -- our cultural outlook comes from.Conceptions of justice, of ethics, of a democracy, they all come from the pre-Christian state of Europe.</p><p end="3307" is_meta="false" speaker="A.C. Grayling" start="3241">Christianity was an oriental religion that erupted into Europe and changed the course of European history, and derailed it for over 1,000 years. People couldn't build a dome like the Dome of Maxentius in Rome because they'd lost the understanding of simple engineering. Wasn't until Brunelleschi's Dome in Florence in the 15 -- 16th century that that was possible. So we're looking at a phenomenon here where religion did to our forefathers, did to the history of our culture exactly what Matthew says it's doing again to the prospects for science and progress in our contemporary world.</p><p end="3307" is_meta="false" speaker="Rabbi David Wolpe" start="3241">Very briefly, Anthony, I think actually you're the victim of a very parochial education because long before Christianity, Judaism enunciated all the ideals that you say did not actually come from religion. In 50 BCE, when Hillel was asked to summarize all of Judaism, he said that which is hateful to you, don't do to others. And the sages of Judaism were killed by the Roman Empire, not be a religious empire, as opposed to Socrates who was killed by the Athenian polity that you idealize.</p><p end="3362" is_meta="false" speaker="Rabbi David Wolpe" start="3307">They killed their own sages. In Judaism, we venerated them. And they&#8217;re actually the ones who ceded Christianity and gave us the morality that you claim came from the Stoics.</p><p end="3362" is_meta="false" speaker="A.C. Grayling" start="3307">Can I tell David just a quick little anecdote about a conversation I had with a cab driver in London. Cab drivers in London are very interesting folk.</p><p end="3362" is_meta="true" speaker="A.C. Grayling" start="3307">laughter</p><p end="3362" is_meta="false" speaker="A.C. Grayling" start="3307">I asked this man if he&#8217;d read the Old Testament. He said he hadn&#8217;t. I said, &#8220;Do you remember any stories from the Old Testament.&#8221; He thought for a moment. He said,</p><p end="3362" is_meta="false" speaker="A.C. Grayling" start="3307">&#8220;Yep, I remember something about a woman being turned into a pillar of salt,&#8221; and I took this to be evidence of some domestic disorder in his own family and wishful thinking.[laughter]</p><p end="3362" is_meta="false" speaker="A.C. Grayling" start="3307">I said to him, &#8220;Do you remember that story, you know, God didn&#8217;t like the homosexuals in Sodom so he was going to destroy everybody there? Somebody pointed out to him that there might be a righteous person. He sent the angels to tell Lot to get out of the city. The citizens wanted those two angels, the handsome young men. And Lot said to them, &#8216;You can have my daughters instead.&#8217; When they finally left the city, what happened to his two daughters?&#8221;</p><p end="3431" is_meta="false" speaker="A.C. Grayling" start="3362">They didn&#8217;t have husbands, so they slept with their father and became the --</p><p end="3431" is_meta="false" speaker="Rabbi David Wolpe" start="3362">I know the story. By the way, actually you also are the victim of an inadequate Biblical education I think because Sodom was not destroyed because of homosexuality. Read the book of Ezekiel. It was destroyed because of the cruelty of the people of Sodom,</p><p end="3431" is_meta="false" speaker="Rabbi David Wolpe" start="3362">their immorality, and I really -- I think with all due respect that to cite London cab drivers, pithy though they may be as the demonstration that Judaism didn&#8217;t actually create the morality of the West, may be a little thin.</p><p end="3431" is_meta="false" speaker="A.C. Grayling" start="3362">[unintelligible] the demonstration. And Sodom was destroyed no matter what reason you give to it.</p><p end="3482" is_meta="false" speaker="Matthew Chapman" start="3431">I don&#8217;t think so. There&#8217;s lots and lots of people who do good things and organize --</p><p end="3607" is_meta="false" speaker="A.C. Grayling" start="3541">Okay, I just want to make the point that there are plenty of non-religious people involved in charitable endeavors and they don&#8217;t stay on afterwards because they don&#8217;t have an extra agenda. And I just want to quote to you --</p><p end="3607" is_meta="false" speaker="A.C. Grayling" start="3541">John Donvan:You mean proselytization?</p><p end="3607" is_meta="false" speaker="A.C. Grayling" start="3541">Yeah exactly. And I don&#8217;t -- I just want to --</p><p end="3607" is_meta="false" speaker="A.C. Grayling" start="3541">Yes, sir, because I don&#8217;t think that they&#8217;re staying on because they haven&#8217;t got anything to proselytize about. They don&#8217;t want a return for their investment. George Bernard Shaw said -- very, very quick quote -- he said when he gave up religion -- escaped religion as a teenager, he said that moment was the moment when I felt the dawning of moral passion because people who don&#8217;t take a box out of the frozen food warehouse of morality, you know, there it all is, are people who have go to think about their responsibilities and about their relationships to other people. They've got to be people who think about the diversity, how different people are from one another. You know the golden rule, "Do unto others as you would have them do unto you," George Bernard Shaw said, no, under no circumstances should you do to others what you'd like them to do to you because they may not like it.</p><p end="3662" is_meta="false" speaker="A.C. Grayling" start="3607">And that's a very good insight. It means see them for what they are in their individuality and personality and base your morality on a genuine understanding of what it is to be human in a human world.</p><p end="3726" is_meta="false" speaker="Matthew Chapman" start="3662">Well, I think the difference is that even the mistakes of people who are acting out of nonreligious motives are mistakes based on reason. And that most of the horrors of religion are mistakes based out of superstitious fear and delusion. And I cannot see how delusion can be healthy to a society. I just can't -- I can't see it. Not all of these religions can be true because they all contradict each other. So some of them are delusional.</p><p end="3726" is_meta="false" speaker="Matthew Chapman" start="3662">How can this be healthy? It's divisive. It's nonsensical. And I am not saying that atheism has come up with the perfect solution. But there has to be a better way than this.</p><p end="3726" is_meta="false" speaker="Matthew Chapman" start="3662">I think it's secular humanism. It's atheism.</p><p end="3726" is_meta="false" speaker="Rabbi David Wolpe" start="3662">I mean, the frustration that I repeatedly am having in this debate is that we're arguing theory against the world.</p><p end="3792" is_meta="false" speaker="Rabbi David Wolpe" start="3726">The world is that there are millions and millions and millions of people who, by their own testimony, although the other side may not believe it, say they're doing good because they believe there is a transcendent purpose in their doing good. Therefore,</p><p end="3792" is_meta="false" speaker="Rabbi David Wolpe" start="3726">they'll do it tomorrow, next week, next month, next year. It's not a club that's going to dissolve. They're not going to go away. They're not going to stop doing it. And they're going to teach their children to do it. And what we hear on the other side, to a great extent is, that's bad because it's delusional. And the question is not actually would the world be better off if everybody had the same scientific ideology? Would that be a better world? The world -- the question is, what would it be like if religion were gone?</p><p end="3792" is_meta="false" speaker="Matthew Chapman" start="3726">I'd like to propose an --</p><p end="3792" is_meta="false" speaker="Matthew Chapman" start="3726">-- experiment, if I may, which is I would ask the audience, how many of you out there do good things, do charity, visit people in hospitals, take care of friends?</p><p end="3846" is_meta="false" speaker="Matthew Chapman" start="3792">And could I see a show of hands of anyone who's involved in charitable endeavors,</p><p end="3846" is_meta="false" speaker="Matthew Chapman" start="3792">helping people, taking care of animals, giving money to charity, whatever it is.</p><p end="3846" is_meta="false" speaker="Matthew Chapman" start="3792">There we have --</p><p end="3846" is_meta="false" speaker="Matthew Chapman" start="3792">Now -- now I would like to see a show of hands of how many of those people did that because they feared religion or religious authority.</p><p end="3846" is_meta="false" speaker="Rabbi David Wolpe" start="3792">Feared?</p><p end="3846" is_meta="false" speaker="Matthew Chapman" start="3792">Well, or were -- or were --</p><p end="3846" is_meta="false" speaker="Rabbi David Wolpe" start="3792">Here's -- here's my question.</p><p end="3846" is_meta="false" speaker="Matthew Chapman" start="3792">Okay. I haven't -- no, I haven't -- I haven't finished yet.</p><p end="3846" is_meta="false" speaker="Matthew Chapman" start="3792">I haven't finished yet.</p><p end="3846" is_meta="false" speaker="Rabbi David Wolpe" start="3792">Okay.</p><p end="3846" is_meta="false" speaker="Matthew Chapman" start="3792">Or -- I mean, we saw no hands there, or who did it because they thought that by doing good action it would get them into heaven. Let's see a show of hand on that.</p><p end="3846" is_meta="false" speaker="Rabbi David Wolpe" start="3792">Didn't say that, either.</p><p end="3846" is_meta="false" speaker="Matthew Chapman" start="3792">Now --</p><p end="3846" is_meta="false" speaker="Matthew Chapman" start="3792">Now let's see a show of hands from people who do these good things simply because they have a human empathy towards people who are suffering.</p><p end="3901" is_meta="false" speaker="Matthew Chapman" start="3846">I don't think so. I mean --</p><p end="3901" is_meta="false" speaker="Matthew Chapman" start="3846">-- people do good things --</p><p end="3901" is_meta="false" speaker="Matthew Chapman" start="3846">-- the majority here.</p><p end="3901" is_meta="false" speaker="Rabbi David Wolpe" start="3846">The reason that that's not persuasive, shall we say, is first of all, very few religious people will tell you it's to get into heaven. It's because it's what God expects them to do. That's first of all. In other words, you do it because other human beings are created in the image of God. And if you take that out, then our link is a species link. But if we're all children of the same God, then you are my brother and sister, and that's why you do it. It's different. It's not because you are afraid of God. And second, people's self-</p><p end="3901" is_meta="false" speaker="Rabbi David Wolpe" start="3846">reported charitable doings, although obviously everyone here is completely honest.</p><p end="3901" is_meta="false" speaker="Rabbi David Wolpe" start="3846">People's self-reported charitable doings are a lot less reliable than survey after survey after survey.</p><p end="3963" is_meta="false" speaker="Rabbi David Wolpe" start="3901">And the way that the surveys were answered by Putnam, by Brooks, by Koenig, by respected sociologists, the way that he answered them is by asking you to raise your hand. Now, I want to ask you seriously, how many of you believe that all these sociologists and psychologists are cooking the data, and how many -- you don't have to raise your hand. And how many of you believe that whether you like religion or not, the truth is that it does make people much more inclined to be self-sacrificing in this world.</p><p end="3963" is_meta="false" speaker="Rabbi David Wolpe" start="3901">And if you don't believe it, then all I can say is, I know a world without religion that you can look at. I'm from that world. It's called Hollywood.</p><p end="3963" is_meta="true" speaker="Rabbi David Wolpe" start="3901">laughter</p><p end="4024" is_meta="false" speaker="Matthew Chapman" start="3963">Well, I mean, that, to me, is the entire problem.</p><p end="4083" is_meta="false" speaker="Matthew Chapman" start="4024">If you look at any religious text, it can be interpreted in any way and give you an excuse to do anything. These gentleman here, I'm sure they're very nice people, and they look at it in the most benign way. I've heard Rabbi Wolpe over there say that the whole process of religion is that you take all these complicated books, and you filter them through human consciousness and out comes something that makes sense. I agree.</p><p end="4083" is_meta="false" speaker="Matthew Chapman" start="4024">And when you filter them out, what you get is humanism. Jefferson did the same thing with the Bible. He took out everything that he thought was contemptible or had nothing to do with the origins of religion. He got 48 pages. I say you could bring it down to one page that said -- or one phrase which would be "Do unto others as you do -- as you would have done to you." It is as simple as that. And all of those texts --</p><p end="4083" is_meta="false" speaker="Matthew Chapman" start="4024">-- [unintelligible].</p><p end="4083" is_meta="false" speaker="Matthew Chapman" start="4024">The problem is the ancient texts that are infinitely interpretable for any purpose.</p><p end="4145" is_meta="false" speaker="Dinesh D'Souza" start="4083">Well, yeah. First of all, Jefferson, who was a man of the enlightenment, not a very devout Christian, as you point out correctly. But when Jefferson was asked, "What is the source of our rights?" he could have said the social contract. He could have said the enlightenment. But no, he said it's the creator. He could think of only one source. One word about the texts. I think the point that Rabbi Wolpe and I are stressing is that the way to interpret the text is to look and see whether the people who revered the text do the things in the text. So, for example, he read a passage from Deuteronomy about chopping off people's arms or removing their genitals. So I ask you, how many religious people are going around without arms or genitals? No one who is Jewish or Christian reads the texts that way. So there's a form of, you might say, atheist fundamentalism in taking the text in so literal a way that no Christian -- I mean, there was a debate that between Paul and the early apostles about which aspects of the ancient law should apply to Christians.</p><p end="4200" is_meta="false" speaker="Dinesh D'Souza" start="4145">It was settled 2,000 years ago that Christians would not follow the Old Testament in a literal way. And even the guys in Dover aren't doing that. So in a way, I think these guys are charging an imaginary dragon.</p><p end="4200" is_meta="false" speaker="Dinesh D'Souza" start="4145">You're trying to hold us accountable to texts which were, in a sense, not taken as literal 2,000 years ago.</p><p end="4260" is_meta="false" speaker="Dinesh D'Souza" start="4200">I think your question is echoing an argument in Sigmund Freud that religion is wish fulfillment. We all -- but life is tough, we have diabetes, we have the gravedigger, we would like to have another life, and so religion is made up to accommodate that wish.</p><p end="4260" is_meta="false" speaker="Dinesh D'Souza" start="4200">Now, I think that actually that theory doesn't square with what religion actually holds,</p><p end="4260" is_meta="false" speaker="Dinesh D'Souza" start="4200">and here's why. Certainly it explains heaven. Heaven is a good example of wish fulfillment. But remember that all of the major Abrahamic religions also have hell.</p><p end="4260" is_meta="false" speaker="Dinesh D'Souza" start="4200">Now, think about that. Hell is a lot worse than diabetes.</p><p end="4260" is_meta="true" speaker="Dinesh D'Souza" start="4200">laughter</p><p end="4260" is_meta="false" speaker="Dinesh D'Souza" start="4200">Hell is a lot worse than death. Why would we make that stuff up? The bottom line I'm trying to make is that that diagnosis of religion as expressing wish fulfillment runs headlong into the actual facts that religious people actually sometimes fear a fate far worse than anything that life can offer them.</p><p end="4382" is_meta="false" speaker="Dinesh D'Souza" start="4320">I want to focus on the Holocaust. I would recommend to you this book, "Hitler's Table Talk." It's edited by the prominent historian, Hugh Trevor-Roper, and it constitutes direct notes of Hitler's comments authorized by Bormann between 1941 and 1945. In the early 1930s when Hitler was coming to power, he wanted to win over the Bavarian Catholics and the Lutherans in Germany and so he invented what he called a Nazi Christ,</p><p end="4382" is_meta="false" speaker="Dinesh D'Souza" start="4320">not a Christ who was killed but a Jew killer. And he tried to sell that to the churches which didn't go for it. This book records page after page of Hitler's loathing and hatred for Christianity.</p><p end="4447" is_meta="false" speaker="Dinesh D'Souza" start="4382">He regarded the church as the most dangerous opposition to the Nazi regime, and I could read for an hour quotations from Hitler's mouth about his hatred for Christianity.</p><p end="4447" is_meta="false" speaker="Dinesh D'Souza" start="4382">My point is what the atheists will put up on their websites are quotations from the early 1930s, the Mein Kampf where Hitler says, "I'm doing the lord's work." This was part of a propaganda campaign to win over the churches that was unsuccessful. Hitler was a hater of Christianity. I've never called Hitler an atheist, he was a certain kind of a pagan.</p><p end="4566" is_meta="false" speaker="A.C. Grayling" start="4507">Yeah, I think the response is that you have to notice that most of the advance countries of the world are secular constitutionally, like this one, or functionally secular like my own United Kingdom. And the point about those societies is that they organize welfare,</p><p end="4566" is_meta="false" speaker="A.C. Grayling" start="4507">education, defense, infrastructure, and they do this not in the name of one or another religion but in the name of society generally. So when you look at the benefits, you look at the rational application of our ideas about how a society should flourish and advance and what the needs are of the members of that society, the post-enlightenment world,</p><p end="4566" is_meta="false" speaker="A.C. Grayling" start="4507">the world since the 18th century, the world which has been putting to work the ideas of scientific rationality has made a vast improvement to the lives of most individual people.</p><p end="4623" is_meta="false" speaker="A.C. Grayling" start="4566">When you think of the poverty and you think of the ill health and you think of the divisiveness of societies before that time and compare them to the society of today --</p><p end="4623" is_meta="false" speaker="A.C. Grayling" start="4566">and notice this. In every city of the world, there are millions of acts of personal kindness and cooperation between people, far outweighs all the conflict and difficulty there is in the world. And it has nothing to do with their ideologies or religions or anything else.</p><p end="4623" is_meta="false" speaker="Matthew Chapman" start="4566">I would like to add though, I think --</p><p end="4623" is_meta="false" speaker="Matthew Chapman" start="4566">--it&#8217;s absurd to say that secular people advertise and religious people don&#8217;t.</p><p end="4681" is_meta="false" speaker="Matthew Chapman" start="4623">Religion is a constant process or advertising. Every good deed religious people do is taken along with a banner showing whatever religion did it. Doctors without Borders makes no claim to having any religion, nor does it claim to be atheist --</p><p end="4681" is_meta="false" speaker="Rabbi David Wolpe" start="4623">Can I do a poll now of the group? Let me ask you, how many of you had heard of the largest aid organization of the world that I mentioned at the beginning? How many of you had heard of it? Now how many of you had heard of Doctors without Borders? I rest my case.</p><p end="4681" is_meta="true" speaker="Rabbi David Wolpe" start="4623">laughter</p><p end="4738" is_meta="false" speaker="A.C. Grayling" start="4681">No, I think we&#8217;re arguing the world would be better off without religion.</p><p end="4804" is_meta="false" speaker="A.C. Grayling" start="4738">We&#8217;re -- the point is --</p><p end="4804" is_meta="false" speaker="A.C. Grayling" start="4738">I understand his question exactly, and it&#8217;s a deep point of principle that in all these kinds of debates, it&#8217;s not about individuals. This is not about people. This is not about human beings. We understand why human beings are religious. They&#8217;re brought up to be religious, or they&#8217;re not told enough about the history of their religion. They&#8217;re given the most updated version of it, and so on. So it&#8217;s not about attacking individuals. It&#8217;s about attacking ideas. It&#8217;s about attacking ideologies. It&#8217;s about attacking conceptual frameworks which act like spectacles that make people see things in a particular way.</p><p end="4804" is_meta="false" speaker="A.C. Grayling" start="4738">That&#8217;s the argument. It&#8217;s not saying that we would like all Jewish people or Muslim people or Christian people taken as individuals not to be there. No. What we would like them is to be free from those distorting ideologies.</p><p end="4867" is_meta="false" speaker="Dinesh D'Souza" start="4804">I'll make my own case hard by looking solely at Islam because it is such a controversial subject in our world today. I would submit that the world would be vastly worse -- the Muslim world would be vastly worse if it wasn't for Islam. Let's look at why that's the case. First of all, you have to look at what was there in the Bedouin culture before Mohammed. Rape, pillage, concubinage. Mohammed actually was a moderate in limiting the number of wives to four and by basically saying that you had to treat the four wives equally, giving them all the same gifts and so on.</p><p end="4924" is_meta="false" speaker="Dinesh D'Souza" start="4867">Mohammed essentially ensured that the entire Muslim world, for the most part, you'd have people with one wife. Polygamy is very rare in the Muslim world for that reason.</p><p end="4924" is_meta="false" speaker="Dinesh D'Souza" start="4867">So the bottom line of it is that Islam was a vastly civilizing force, not to mention the introduction of a cosmopolitan civilization with a history, a philosophy and a distinctivearchitecture, not to mention great Islamic philosophers and thinkers. Even the great Jewish scholar Bernard Lewis has a great appreciation for the civilizing influence --</p><p end="4924" is_meta="false" speaker="Dinesh D'Souza" start="4867">-- of Islam in the world.</p><p end="4924" is_meta="false" speaker="A.C. Grayling" start="4867">Well, I just --</p><p end="4924" is_meta="false" speaker="A.C. Grayling" start="4867">-- have in mind what Gautama Buddha said to his followers. He said, "Don't make me a god, and don't turn this into a religion. It's a philosophy. It's a philosophy of compassion. It's a philosophy of authenticity. It's a philosophy about living respectfully and responsibly.</p><p end="4985" is_meta="false" speaker="A.C. Grayling" start="4924">Don't make it a religion, and don't turn me into a god." And the thing is that even if it was just the Norse gods and paganism or the Olympian gods, somehow or other, it would cease being that thing that the Buddha wanted a philosophy to be, and it would become something that admitted, you know, all its extremes, including the hypocrites on one side and the extremists on the other.</p><p end="5047" is_meta="false" speaker="A.C. Grayling" start="4985">-- yes, I think --</p><p end="5047" is_meta="false" speaker="A.C. Grayling" start="4985">I think we were thinking about more or less organized collective practice of doctrine and morality. I mean, people do -- the thing about the word "religion" it's like sort of grandmother's underpants. You know, it's huge and baggy and saggy.</p><p end="5047" is_meta="true" speaker="A.C. Grayling" start="4985">laughter</p><p end="5047" is_meta="false" speaker="A.C. Grayling" start="4985">It's got so many things in it. We talk about football, is this religion or tennis is our religion. And so our meaning is something that obsesses you and takes you over. The idea of one person believing that there are fairies at the bottom of the garden, and that that's person's religion is a bit of a stretch of the word.</p><p end="5104" is_meta="false" speaker="A.C. Grayling" start="5047">You want to look at the paradigm. And the paradigms are Judaean and the Christianity and Islam and Hinduism.</p><p end="5104" is_meta="false" speaker="A.C. Grayling" start="5047">And they are collective practices.</p><p end="5104" is_meta="false" speaker="A.C. Grayling" start="5047">John Donvan:Is there a religion without the organization, Rabbi Wolpe? David Wolpe.</p><p end="5104" is_meta="false" speaker="Rabbi David Wolpe" start="5047">No.</p><p end="5104" is_meta="false" speaker="Rabbi David Wolpe" start="5047">I mean, there is personal religious experience, but what we're talking about today is the social organization of religion and what religion does in the world, not so specifically what it does for individuals. So I would --</p><p end="5160" is_meta="false" speaker="Rabbi David Wolpe" start="5104">I'm not going to give it to the Vatican, I promise.</p><p end="5160" is_meta="false" speaker="Dinesh D'Souza" start="5104">I think in the case of the Vatican, the wealth of the Vatican is in priceless treasures,</p><p end="5160" is_meta="false" speaker="Dinesh D'Souza" start="5104">tapestries, the ceiling of the Sistine chapel, art. Now, let's remember -- let's remember -</p><p end="5160" is_meta="false" speaker="Dinesh D'Souza" start="5104">- hold on a second. It's not the Vatican's bank balance. It's the Vatican's treasures.</p><p end="5224" is_meta="false" speaker="Dinesh D'Souza" start="5160">And let's remember that it was popes, the Medici popes and so on, who commissioned those paintings. If it wasn't for Catholicism, we wouldn't have the Sistine chapel. Not only that -- not only that, but in a study of achievement, the social scientist Charles Murray asked this question: Why, at the top of the Gothic Cathedral are there gargoyles that have been detailed and carved in a way that no one can see them? And when the people who did those were asked why they were doing it when no one could see it, they said, we are carving for the eyes of God. The point being that transcendence introduces a new perspective. Sub specie aeternitatis. The perspective of eternity. And so in a sense, your orientation is different, you act differently. And I'm not defending accumulations of wealth. I concede, religion, like any human institution is susceptible to corruption, a little bit like politics or anything else. But I'm saying on the balance, I think it would be wrong to think that we would be better off as a civilization as a culture, it's not all Athens.</p><p end="5281" is_meta="false" speaker="Dinesh D'Souza" start="5224">It's a combination of Athens and Jerusalem.</p><p end="5281" is_meta="false" speaker="A.C. Grayling" start="5224">The church commissioned a lot of art because it had the money. And even artists have to eat. And we&#8217;ll notice that after the medieval period, the time when the great Gothic Cathedrals were built, soaring up to heaven with their wonderful spires and crockets,that was a time when people were taught that this life is short and nasty and brutish,</p><p end="5281" is_meta="false" speaker="A.C. Grayling" start="5224">and you've got to hang in there. And if you didn't sin too much, you might have a bit of a shorter time in purgatory. And the Renaissance, the rediscovery of classical antiquity and its love of things human and things natural reintroduced not just devotional art but landscapes, picnics, portraits of ordinary people, paintings of still lives, a celebration of this world and all the joy and pleasure that there is to be had in this world, a humanistic perspective.</p><p end="5350" is_meta="false" speaker="Rabbi David Wolpe" start="5281">Was it not Thomas Hobbes who said life was nasty, brutish and short? It wasn't a religious. It was a philosopher.</p><p end="5350" is_meta="false" speaker="A.C. Grayling" start="5281">I was quoting him.</p><p end="5350" is_meta="false" speaker="Rabbi David Wolpe" start="5281">Yes.</p><p end="5350" is_meta="true" speaker="Rabbi David Wolpe" start="5281">laughter</p><p end="5350" is_meta="false" speaker="Rabbi David Wolpe" start="5281">Should I take a poll?</p><p end="5350" is_meta="false" speaker="Rabbi David Wolpe" start="5281">In survey after survey after survey, Americans still pronounce themselves overwhelmingly religious, overwhelmingly religious, 80 percent, 90 percent.</p><p end="5402" is_meta="false" speaker="Rabbi David Wolpe" start="5350">It is certainly true. And by the way, and don't discount economic downturn because that also has a profound effect on religious institutions and other nonprofits as it does on the -- on the rest of the economy. I think that you find both trends at the same time.</p><p end="5402" is_meta="false" speaker="Rabbi David Wolpe" start="5350">I think that this is a complicated -- you need Balanchine to choreograph this. It's complicated. At the same time as people's religion is still high, their sense of religious affiliation and how they want to express their religion shifts very much. And so I don't think that you necessarily are seeing a decline in people's sense that there's something transcendent, something greater than themselves. But some organized religions, and not all, Mormonism is growing, some evangelical groups are growing, some religions but not all are declining.</p><p end="5464" is_meta="false" speaker="Rabbi David Wolpe" start="5402">That is astounding.</p><p end="5464" is_meta="false" speaker="Rabbi David Wolpe" start="5402">Are they Jewish now, are they --</p><p end="5464" is_meta="false" speaker="Rabbi David Wolpe" start="5402">Maybe I should do the Vatican --</p><p end="5464" is_meta="false" speaker="Rabbi David Wolpe" start="5402">John Donvan:Dinesh D'Souza.</p><p end="5464" is_meta="false" speaker="Dinesh D'Souza" start="5402">Well, I do think it's -- there was an expectation in the '60s and '70s that the world was becoming secular. Europe was seen as being the automatic vanguard of this and the assumption was that as people become more affluent and educated they will automatically become more secular. It's turned out not to be the case. America has not gone the way of Europe, and in fact if you look at any other culture, we're not seeing this automatic secularization. If you meet a Hindu Ph.D. and a Hindu janitor they're just as likely to be religious. There's no difference. Same in Islam. So I think that it is the disproof of the secular assumption that has in a sense brought out this aggressive new atheism because the atheists thought they were winning anyway, they were winning by default.</p><p end="5523" is_meta="false" speaker="Dinesh D'Souza" start="5464">I think the European case is anomalous. It was not an attack on religion. It was an attack historically on an oppressive alliance between throne and altar. It was a political rebellion against a particular manifestation of religion in that society and the rest of the world is not going that way at all.</p><p end="5523" is_meta="false" speaker="Matthew Chapman" start="5464">I -- sadly I don't see much of an advance in atheism, and as for the churches emptying out, I think it's rather like the corner stores being taken over by Walmart. You have the little churches and then you have the big mega-church. And you have churches now where 20,000 people go to pray, evangelical Christian. So you know I'm sure there's some diminution of religious attendants but I don't see a huge surge of atheism unfortunately.</p><p end="5523" is_meta="false" speaker="A.C. Grayling" start="5464">I think Dinesh might be guilty of a tiny bit of wishful thinking there because the trend is towards more secularism.</p><p end="5581" is_meta="false" speaker="A.C. Grayling" start="5523">In fact, what's happened since 9/11 when the very violent religious activism brought religion back into everybody's point of focus again, is that the volume has gone up.</p><p end="5581" is_meta="false" speaker="A.C. Grayling" start="5523">People think that religion is resurging but actually it's because the volume has gone upin the debate. Literally thousands, literally thousands of books of a religious nature are published every year in the United States of America and in Britain. You don't have to walk into a Barnes and Noble to see shelf after shelf of them. About half a dozen books which are by Dawkins and Christopher Hitchens and Sam Harris and Daniel Dennett,</p><p end="5581" is_meta="false" speaker="A.C. Grayling" start="5523">about half a dozen books have been published attacking religion and putting the atheist case, and all hell breaks loose. But by the way hell was sufficiently banned by the Episcopalian church --</p><p end="5581" is_meta="true" speaker="A.C. Grayling" start="5523">laughter</p><p end="5581" is_meta="false" speaker="A.C. Grayling" start="5523">-- back in the 1920s. I don't know whether you know this but they're trying to reinvent themselves, but anyway it broke loose because half a dozen books had come out attacking the religious standpoint. And what had happened was this, before 9/11 religion went sort of by default.</p><p end="5641" is_meta="false" speaker="A.C. Grayling" start="5581">If I met a religious person, I would you know pussyfoot around, few eggshells.</p><p end="5641" is_meta="false" speaker="A.C. Grayling" start="5581">Somebody once said, you meet a Christian, it's like meeting somebody who's had a recent death in the family, which is a bit sort of apropos.</p><p end="5641" is_meta="true" speaker="A.C. Grayling" start="5581">laughter</p><p end="5641" is_meta="false" speaker="A.C. Grayling" start="5581">So you wouldn't say anything -- and they probably at a dinner party wouldn't come out with their religious mission statements.</p><p end="5641" is_meta="false" speaker="A.C. Grayling" start="5581">But after 9/11 they did start to do it. The gloves have come off. The debate is now out in the open. And that's why it all sounds so noisy.</p><p end="5707" is_meta="false" speaker="Rabbi David Wolpe" start="5641">I'm not going to read to you from the article in Skeptic Magazine that appeared in the most recent Skeptic Magazine which is as anti-religious a magazine as you can find saying that it is not possible to sustain that religion causes violence in the world, that,</p><p end="5707" is_meta="false" speaker="Rabbi David Wolpe" start="5641">that is in fact not true and none of the statistics support it. But I do encourage you to take a look and read it and instead I'm going to end with a story. I'm a rabbi.</p><p end="5707" is_meta="true" speaker="Rabbi David Wolpe" start="5641">laughter</p><p end="5707" is_meta="false" speaker="Rabbi David Wolpe" start="5641">So Rabbi Hugo Gryn was a rabbi in England for many years but he and his father were in Auschwitz when he was a child. And Hanukkah came around. And his father took the precious margarine ration and instead of using it for food he used it to light the Hanukkah candle. And his son protested and said how can you do this? Don't you understand that this is food? And his father said to him, &#8220;Listen, my child, we have learned that you can go three weeks without eating. You can go three days without drinking, but you cannot go three minutes without help.&#8221;</p><p end="5764" is_meta="false" speaker="Rabbi David Wolpe" start="5707">Now we&#8217;ve been accused of being too sophisticated to participate in this debate. Right.</p><p end="5764" is_meta="false" speaker="Rabbi David Wolpe" start="5707">Real religious people are simple-minded. But I want to tell you that there are people all over this world, who, whether you think of them as simple-minded or not, the hope of their lives, the purpose of their lives, the good that they do is dependent not in fact on evolutionary pressures alone but on that candle, on the idea that God not threatens them, not is going to send them to hell, but that God created them in God&#8217;s own image,</p><p end="5764" is_meta="false" speaker="Rabbi David Wolpe" start="5707">that they are precious, that they are sacred, and so are other human beings. And they wouldn&#8217;t live three minutes without that hope. And if you vote for the motion, then you&#8217;re suggesting that the world would be better if the hope were taken away from them. It isn&#8217;t, and you shouldn&#8217;t.</p><p end="5820" is_meta="false" speaker="A.C. Grayling" start="5764">Thank you. It seems very unkind to say that, but alas, it&#8217;s just basically true that the religious outlook on the world has its roots, its origins in the beliefs, the superstitions of illiterate goatherds who lived up to 3,000 years ago. And however much religion reinvents itself and however much it tries to make us forget its history and however much it obscures the fact that it depends upon proselytizing very small children for its survival, despite all that, we have an opportunity to think again and afresh and to recognize that in order to live with the kind of hope, with the kind of responsibility, with the kind of love for our neighbor, which is essential for a world of peace.</p><p end="5890" is_meta="false" speaker="A.C. Grayling" start="5820">We&#8217;ve got to do that hard work of choosing our morality, choosing our ethics, thinking about the principles of which we live, not borrowing it, not inheriting it, not having to conform to a set of doctrines about these things and a set of rituals which people very,</p><p end="5890" is_meta="false" speaker="A.C. Grayling" start="5820">very, very long time ago depended upon to do their thinking for them, but to think afresh, start again, and look at this world as a place where reason and human experience have to be our best, because they are in fact our only guides.</p><p end="5890" is_meta="false" speaker="Dinesh D'Souza" start="5820">Rabbi Wolpe and I have been laboring under a tremendous disadvantage in this debate.</p><p end="5890" is_meta="false" speaker="Dinesh D'Souza" start="5820">Both our opponents have a British accent.</p><p end="5890" is_meta="true" speaker="Dinesh D'Souza" start="5820">laughter</p><p end="5890" is_meta="false" speaker="Dinesh D'Souza" start="5820">Now, I was raised in India, and I come from a small part of India called Goa, which was a Portuguese colony for many years.</p><p end="5940" is_meta="false" speaker="Dinesh D'Souza" start="5890">And I&#8217;d always assumed that my Christianity was the product quite honestly of the Portuguese Inquisition. The Portuguese came to India with a sword in one hand and a Bible in the other. And lots of people converted. They were extremely persuasive.</p><p end="5940" is_meta="true" speaker="Dinesh D'Souza" start="5890">laughter</p><p end="5940" is_meta="false" speaker="Dinesh D'Souza" start="5890">So I&#8217;m very alert to the dangers of religion. On the other hand, I once asked my grandfather, a historian, about this. And he said that the fact of the matter was that tons of Indians flung themselves into the arms of the missionaries. They wanted to convert. Why? And my grandfather&#8217;s answer was that if you look at history, it was because of the ancestral -- not religious, but cultural caste system. Most of the Indians were relegated to the lower caste.</p><p end="6006" is_meta="false" speaker="Dinesh D'Souza" start="5940">And the fact of the matter is that if you were at the bottom, an untouchable, let&#8217;s say,</p><p end="6006" is_meta="false" speaker="Dinesh D'Souza" start="5940">there was no way to get out. There was no way to move up. No amount of merit could help you. And so, even though the missionaries might have been greedy and irredentist,</p><p end="6006" is_meta="false" speaker="Dinesh D'Souza" start="5940">the fact that they preached an idea of universal brotherhood, of love, of compassion,</p><p end="6006" is_meta="false" speaker="Dinesh D'Souza" start="5940">inspired people, ennobled their lives. And that&#8217;s why they became Christians. A world without religion would in fact be a grimmer, harsher, meaner world. Religion, for all its flaws, gives us a kinder and gentler world. And that&#8217;s why it&#8217;s better to have a world with religion in it. Thank you.</p><p end="6006" is_meta="false" speaker="Matthew Chapman" start="5940">The world would be better off without religion because it is better off without religion.</p><p end="6006" is_meta="false" speaker="Matthew Chapman" start="5940">If religion made people behave better, markers of social dysfunction, drug addiction,</p><p end="6006" is_meta="false" speaker="Matthew Chapman" start="5940">ignorance, teen pregnancies, violent crime would be much lower in highly religious societies.</p><p end="6065" is_meta="false" speaker="Matthew Chapman" start="6006">In fact, the opposite is true. To quote my friend, Austin Dacey, "In post Christian Europe, entire nations have been plunked into endemic health, sky rocketing education and hopelessly low rates of violent crime." This was a disadvantage to the English. AndI'm not-- I'm American. Forgive me for using America by way of comparison. I am an American. I love America. However, 90 percent of Americans believe in God. But we have by far the largest prison population on earth. Drug addiction is widespread. Gun violence is grotesque. Our education system produces kids whose math and science skills are far lower than in secular countries while our rate of teen pregnancy is far higher. And in a country so rich and Christian, it's amazing how many people live in abject poverty. Religion is a rational, morally confusing and divisive. It still exposes young children to the ghastly concept of hell. It still denigrates women.</p><p end="6120" is_meta="false" speaker="Matthew Chapman" start="6065">It still fosters homophobia. And "religious" gave us 9/11. Making no reference to God,</p><p end="6120" is_meta="false" speaker="Matthew Chapman" start="6065">science has, among many other things, rid us of the plagues, smallpox and polio,</p><p end="6120" is_meta="false" speaker="Matthew Chapman" start="6065">dramatically reduced infant mortality, doubled the average length of a burdened life and is coming to understand how the brain works, including its capacity for empathy and moral decision making. All this progress, all this beautiful knowledge, all this alleviation of human suffering in 100 years. Religion has had thousands of years to prove its supernatural effectiveness. It hasn't. We think it's time to try a safer and more enlightened way. So I hope you will support our position that the world will be better off without religion.</p><p end="6120" is_meta="true" speaker="Matthew Chapman" start="6065">applause</p></transcript></debate>
