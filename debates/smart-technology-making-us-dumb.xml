The most important point that we make -- because it was coauthored -- was that the web is actually a s ocial place, although it didn't look like it at the time . What we got --</p><p end="610" is_meta="false" speaker="David Weinberger" start="555">one of the things we got very wrong was that we didn't know we would have to fight to keep the web the way it was.</p><p end="676" is_meta="false" speaker="David Weinberger" start="610">I am a very shaded if not shady --</p><p end="1153" is_meta="false" speaker="David Weinberger" start="1095">Thank you.</p><p end="1153" is_meta="true" speaker="David Weinberger" start="1095">applause</p><p end="1153" is_meta="false" speaker="David Weinberger" start="1095">Thank you. Thank you, Nick and -- so if Nick is right, and our technology is having this physical effect on our physical brain, keeping us from being able to form knowledge out of information,</p><p end="1153" is_meta="false" speaker="David Weinberger" start="1095">then why is this -- it seems to me to that this is -- this is the greatest time in human history to be somebody who cares about knowledge .</p><p end="1208" is_meta="false" speaker="David Weinberger" start="1153">This is -- this is a renaissance of knowledge . If we take the question, "Is our smart tech making us dumb," I want to not even refute that. I want to ask, why do we keep asking that? Because if "smart" means that we make good decisions, then we are -- new predictive technologies, very smart -- enable us to do that. If being smart means understanding more, we now have from the</p><p end="1208" is_meta="false" speaker="David Weinberger" start="1153">Higgs boson to the Hubb le telescope, we have the ability through our smart technology to understand more about a universe that's 14 billion years old . And if "smart" means better at our work, then I absolutely, and you absolutely , want your doctor, your auto mechanic, and your airplane pilot to have the smartest technology that there is . So why do we have ask? I think in part it's because of the shock of the new . And this is very, very new, what's going on .</p><p end="1208" is_meta="false" speaker="David Weinberger" start="1153">Andy Clark is a philosopher who makes a point that we don't know, we don't think in our heads .Intelligence Squared: 11 5/14/15 Smart Technology i s Making Us Dumb</p><p end="1269" is_meta="false" speaker="David Weinberger" start="1208">We think with things in the world, out in the world . So a mathematician thinks with chalk on a blackboard . An architect thinks with models in her hands or using a straight edge or something .</p><p end="1269" is_meta="false" speaker="David Weinberger" start="1208">And a meteorolo gist who is using our old tech, who just has a weather vane is not going to be nearly as smart as a meteorologist who's gather data from sensors around the world, big data put to use to predict the weather down to the hour . That's really, really smart. And it's our smart technology t hat lets us do that. If Clark is right, and I think he is, that we think of objects out in the world, and if those tools change, and if they change radically, then the way that we think changes radically, which is why I t hink we even consider the possibility that our smart tech is making us dumb when all the evidence seems to be that in fact we are smarter in the important ways than ever. Another reason perhaps we entertain this notion is that we have a natural tendency to think that the technology we grew up with is natural and is good . But that's not the case .</p><p end="1336" is_meta="false" speaker="David Weinberger" start="1269">We didn't invent gatekeepers because we said -- in the old world, in a prior world -- we didn't</p><p end="1336" is_meta="false" speaker="David Weinberger" start="1269">invent gatekeepers because we thought it was just a swell idea to vastly limit the amount of information and knowledge that we were going to make public, and we didn't say, "You know what would be really swell? Let's create a set of homogenous white guys, and they'll decide what makes it through tho se gates.&#8221; We invented gatekeepers because the old medium, that technology of paper, was so limited . It had gates, and the gates were really, really narrow . And so we needed to have gatekeepers . But now we don't. Now the gates are down. We have this huge abundance, and we adopt new strategies for that. And sometimes it's disconcerting. One of the main strategies is that we skim . We skim a lot. That's actually a really adaptive technology -- technique for dealing with it. And it's not even an old technique. It's a technique that we use when we go into an old -fashioned real bookstore and there are thousands of titles,</p><p end="1336" is_meta="false" speaker="David Weinberger" start="1269">and we skim them on the shelves really quickly to find what we're interested -- and that -- so we still do that now .</p><p end="1389" is_meta="false" speaker="David Weinberger" start="1336">We're doing it online . And just as then, when we find something that's interesting to us, we are able to drill down into it . We start reading it. It's -- in this age of constant distraction, we can't focus , w e're watching seven years of "Game of Thrones," the most complex narrative that we've ever seen in our world . And I'll see you Sunday night . It's great . We love this stuff. Our children are reading seven volumes of complex, intricate narrative and characterization . Our universities ar e turning out experts and scholars who are deep into their topics , deeper than ever because they can go that deep because of the internet. So I don't think the evidence is there, despite the brain chemistry , that we are in fact not knowing . We are knowing more and better than ever .Intelligence Squared: 12 5/14/15 Smart Technology i s Making Us Dumb</p><p end="1455" is_meta="false" speaker="David Weinberger" start="1389">If you think back to the 1980s, for example, you get a newspaper, you'd read the article, you'd find something, you'd read an article . It was really exciting, you wanted to know more . You want -- but you can't because it's 1980 . And all you've got was that rectangle of print. That's what it was like before we had smart technology . You were just stuck. It's infuriating even to think about at this point . That's not right.</p><p end="1455" is_meta="true" speaker="David Weinberger" start="1389">laughter</p><p end="1455" is_meta="false" speaker="David Weinberger" start="1389">It's certainly not natur al. So let me give you an example : 1911, with the -- sorry, Britannica,</p><p end="1455" is_meta="false" speaker="David Weinberger" start="1389">Encyclopedia Britannica had its first article on Oliver Goldsmith, the playwright, 6,000 words long . Each new edition, that gets shorter because they've got to cram in more stuff. By 1994,</p><p end="1455" is_meta="false" speaker="David Weinberger" start="1389">it's down to 1,500 words which means that it's -- the editors of the Britannica, the gate keepers of knowledge and culture, have thrown out 75 percent of what Britannica knows about Goldsmith, because that's how paper works . Wikipedia article, it's 1,400 words, but you've got to count all of the -- look into all of the links, decide which ones of those count in the total for Goldsmith .</p><p end="1520" is_meta="false" speaker="David Weinberger" start="1455">You can do the apples to apples . It's -- and there will be much more . And people will dis agree about what -- which of those links count, which is fine, because in Wikipedia and on the web overall, knowledge is no longer crammed into rectangles . They assume a much more natural sh ape , which is that of a web, which is -- has near infinite capacity . It enables us to accommodate much more complexity of relationships, indefinite complexity, is much bigger than any one brain could ever have made . And we get to see how the knowledge is made,</p><p end="1520" is_meta="false" speaker="David Weinberger" start="1455">which is in many ways very disconcerting . We see that it's human. It's a human product. It's full of fallibility, we see the people are arguing, they're adding, they're getting things wrong,</p><p end="1520" is_meta="false" speaker="David Weinberger" start="1455">they're getting things right. That's how knowledge is made . That's how knowledge was always made . But now we can see it . It's in our face. And that's a truth. That's a truth about knowledge that was always true of knowledge . But now that we can see it, we're beginning --</p><p end="1520" is_meta="false" speaker="David Weinberger" start="1455">it's an amazing thing . We're beginning to invent and discover together new ways of building knowledge, of talking together and building knowledge .</p><p end="1582" is_meta="false" speaker="David Weinberger" start="1520">This has -- we've never been in a period like this before. But it may -- it's upsetting because now we have to face the truth that knowledge has always, always been a human product and always, therefore, subject to and characterized by the fallibility of humans . So it seems clear to me that to argue that our smart tech is making us dumb is not only to be on the wrong side of history; in this case, it's to be on the w rong side of evolution. So I urge you to vote against the proposition and to do so emphatically.Intelligence Squared: 13 5/14/15 Smart Technology i s Making Us Dumb</p><p end="1582" is_meta="true" speaker="David Weinberger" start="1520">laughter</p><p end="1636" is_meta="false" speaker="Andrew Keen" start="1582">Well, I've often been accused of being on the wrong side of history, but I love t he idea of being on the wrong side of evolution.</p><p end="1636" is_meta="true" speaker="Andrew Keen" start="1582">laughter</p><p end="1636" is_meta="false" speaker="Andrew Keen" start="1582">If m y mother was alive, she would particularly appreciate that.</p><p end="1636" is_meta="true" speaker="Andrew Keen" start="1582">laughter</p><p end="1636" is_meta="false" speaker="Andrew Keen" start="1582">That's why I'm not married either.</p><p end="1636" is_meta="true" speaker="Andrew Keen" start="1582">laughter</p><p end="1636" is_meta="false" speaker="Andrew Keen" start="1582">So David is clearly a passionate man, I have a great deal of respect and love for him. We've jousted many times before, but I've never heard him quite as effusive of our world . He talks about something he calls a "renaissance of knowledge .&#8221; A renaissance of knowledge, David,</p><p end="1636" is_meta="false" speaker="Andrew Keen" start="1582">when was the last time you turned the Internet on?</p><p end="1695" is_meta="true" speaker="Andrew Keen" start="1636">laughter</p><p end="1695" is_meta="false" speaker="David Weinberger" start="1636">It's on right now.Intelligence Squared: 14 5/14/15 Smart Technology i s Making Us Dumb</p><p end="1695" is_meta="false" speaker="Andrew Keen" start="1636">When was the list time you looked at Twitter? When was the last time you went on Facebook?</p><p end="1695" is_meta="false" speaker="Andrew Keen" start="1636">When was the last time you observed the nature of our digital culture, the very cult ure that Nick so brilliantly tore apart in his opening remarks?</p><p end="1695" is_meta="true" speaker="Andrew Keen" start="1636">laughter</p><p end="1695" is_meta="false" speaker="Andrew Keen" start="1636">You argue that -- and Nick brings up this word, "distance" -- we're talking, of course, in this new media, the media that you describe as a "renaissance of knowledge" -- what Nick is describing is the end of distance . Perhaps if we we re academics, we would call it, "the death of distance,"</p><p end="1695" is_meta="false" speaker="Andrew Keen" start="1636">the end of distance . So we have these devices . I know this is radio, but on the radio you can imagine what I'm waving . We have the death of distance . We have a culture of intimacy, of personalization .</p><p end="1748" is_meta="false" speaker="Andrew Keen" start="1695">This is the culture of intimacy and personalization that has replaced what you described as "narrow gatekeepers .&#8221; We all become the media in this world . We all have our devices . We all have our publishing platfor ms. We can all tell the world what we're thinking, what we're doing,</p><p end="1748" is_meta="false" speaker="Andrew Keen" start="1695">where we're going, what we're wearing, unfortunately sometimes what we're not wearing.</p><p end="1748" is_meta="true" speaker="Andrew Keen" start="1695">laughter</p><p end="1748" is_meta="false" speaker="Andrew Keen" start="1695">We all have these technologies -- Wiki , YouTube, blogging technologies -- that allow us to express what Nick called the "death of distance," the end of distance . It explains our contemporary cult of authenticity, this idea that we always have to be true to ourselves .</p><p end="1810" is_meta="false" speaker="Andrew Keen" start="1748">It's, of course, a manifestation of a particularly corrupted nature of democracy, a world where everything is intimate, everything is personalized . Nick described it in scientific terms I guess as not only the end of distance, the end of depth, and the end of objectivity . Everything, then, in this m edia, in this world of smart technology is personalized . Everything is intimate. Everything is telling the world what we think . Everything is confirming what we already think . So this so-</p><p end="1810" is_meta="false" speaker="Andrew Keen" start="1748">called smart technology -- I don't know where we get this term . The person who came up with the term, "smart technology," should be spanked, at least metaphorically , because I don't know where the word came from. There's nothing smart about personalized, intimate technology . It simply confirms our misplaced ideal tha t the world revolves around us. It's a pre -Copernican notion . And ironically it's technology confirming that.</p><p end="1871" is_meta="false" speaker="Andrew Keen" start="1810">Intelligence Squared: 15 5/14/15 Smart Technology i s Making Us Dumb</p><p end="1871" is_meta="true" speaker="Andrew Keen" start="1810">laughter</p><p end="1871" is_meta="false" speaker="Andrew Keen" start="1810">Technology by definition, as I'm sure some Frankfurt theorist like Walter Benjamin once argued,</p><p end="1871" is_meta="false" speaker="Andrew Keen" start="1810">t echnology is by definition romantic and nostalgic and reactionary . So don't accuse Nick and I of being that. We are the progressives . We are the ones looking forward . It's technologists, or people with a belief in the idea of technolog y as salvation who are reactionaries, they -- they're the ones who want to drive us back , like Rousseau , to some idealized community . So what do we have? We have then a technology of intimacy , which is resulting , in cultural and social terms , in a more and more personalized culture , a platform where we tell the world what we're doing, what we're thinking . It represents the disappearance, the death not only of distance but of communication. We struggle more and more to talk to one another. S herry Turkle wrote a brilliant book called, "Alone Together.&#8221;</p><p end="1931" is_meta="false" speaker="Andrew Keen" start="1871">This technology is indeed making us alone together . It's a technology not only, as Nick said, of distraction , but of atomization, of alienation. This is Durkheim on steroids. This is a world of profound disorientation and destruction of the community . So what we have, then, in epistemological terms, is the disappearance of that kind of objectivity that Nick talks about . I think David described it -- he thinks this is a good thi ng, epistemological chaos. Everyone saying everything at the same time, and no one listening to anyone else .</p><p end="1931" is_meta="true" speaker="Andrew Keen" start="1871">laughter</p><p end="1931" is_meta="false" speaker="Andrew Keen" start="1871">The ultimate -- the ultimate consequence, of course, of this is the selfie . This is a selfie culture.</p><p end="1931" is_meta="true" speaker="Andrew Keen" start="1871">laughter</p><p end="1931" is_meta="true" speaker="Andrew Keen" start="1871">applause</p><p end="1931" is_meta="false" speaker="Andrew Keen" start="1871">This is a culture where the ultimate expression is photographing ourselves in front of a masterpiece, in front of Auschwitz, in front of someone jumping off the Bay Bridge .</p><p end="2002" is_meta="false" speaker="Andrew Keen" start="1931">These are true examples of selfie culture . Meanwhile, what's going on? David celebrates the narrow gatekeepers that are being destroyed . But of course, since we have this so-called smart technology, what has happened to those gatekeepers? We're seeing not only the death of distance, but the death of newspapers, the death of recorded music, the death of the professional creative class , the people who made their living thinking, the people who have made their living writing books, the people who made their living writing articles for newspapers, the people who made their l iving taking photographs. That kind ofIntelligence Squared: 16 5/14/15 Smart Technology i s Making Us Dumb</p><p end="2002" is_meta="false" speaker="Andrew Keen" start="1931">professionalism is in crisis . Some people even believe that the creative professional is a thing of the past. So, what we have is this double whammy . On the one hand, personalization,</p><p end="2002" is_meta="false" speaker="Andrew Keen" start="1931">intimacy, driven more and mor e into ourselves, into an echo chamber culture, where we never listen to anything anyone else is saying, particularly if it dissonates with us .</p><p end="2045" is_meta="false" speaker="Andrew Keen" start="2002">And on the other hand, the death of a professional culture . That is why you should believe that smart culture -- whoops -- smart technology -- that was Freudian -- smart technology &#8211;</p><p end="2045" is_meta="true" speaker="Andrew Keen" start="2002">laughter</p><p end="2045" is_meta="false" speaker="Andrew Keen" start="2002">-- is certainly making us dumb . Thank you.</p><p end="2045" is_meta="false" speaker="Genevieve Bell" start="2002">Perhaps it's fitting that it falls to a woman and an Australian to rebut that particular moment.</p><p end="2107" is_meta="true" speaker="Genevieve Bell" start="2045">laughter</p><p end="2107" is_meta="false" speaker="Genevieve Bell" start="2045">I find myself delightfully, at the end of this conversation, thinking about the proposition, is smart technology making us dumb? I think it's probably ironic that we started this debate using a smart device to vote on that proposition , and that most of you in the room said you had smart technology on your persons, even though you've now disabled it for radio . When I was given the task of taking on this proposition, as someone who did debate in high school -- which is a long time ago -- I was struck by the impulse to want to deconstruct the question. It's an anthropological approach too, right? And ask "What is smart technology?" Echoing Andrew's concern of what on earth that might mean . What does &#8220; dumb&#8221; mean? Is smart /dumb the only binary pair that we could have, and is dumb necessarily, as an anthropologist, I might want to ask, a bad thin g? I mean, clearly we're putting a set of cultural and moral values around dumbness that are interesting . Smart technology is now being described as romantic,Intelligence Squared: 17 5/14/15 Smart Technology i s Making Us Dumb</p><p end="2107" is_meta="false" speaker="Genevieve Bell" start="2045">progressive, reactionary, a rectangle, and a gatekeeper, all of which is an interesting set of a</p><p end="2107" is_meta="false" speaker="Genevieve Bell" start="2045">baggage to put on a phone, the Internet, algo rithms, the internet of things, and big data.</p><p end="2180" is_meta="false" speaker="Genevieve Bell" start="2107">Nonetheless, we have done that. So, David said to me, "No, Genevieve, don't deconstruct the argument .&#8221; So I'm taking his advice .</p><p end="2180" is_meta="true" speaker="Genevieve Bell" start="2107">laughter</p><p end="2180" is_meta="false" speaker="Genevieve Bell" start="2107">I am , however, going to want to suggest that smart technology has made us smart in some unexpected ways . It's made us more responsive . It's made us more engaged . And in the case of both Andrew and I, it's made us more enraged and I'm not necessarily convinc ed that's a bad thing . So, how might I go about proving that? Well, I think there's a couple of places you'd look to . And many of them are outside of this room, and Manhattan, and outside of the United States . Smart technology makes us smart and it makes us safer. If you were to look, in the last year, I can pull you examples from all over the world . In many African countries and on the Indian subcontinent, mobile phones and text messages are used by governments to send out health warnings and prev entative health messages . When the Ebola outbreak was taking place,</p><p end="2180" is_meta="false" speaker="Genevieve Bell" start="2107">messages were sent on smartphones to tell people how to handle themselves, their communities, and the bodies that they were encountering . Hardly dumb, right? In Australia,</p><p end="2180" is_meta="false" speaker="Genevieve Bell" start="2107">where I come f rom, all the volunteer fire services, which is how we keep ourselves safe in the fire season, use a geo -located app service that sends out notifications to Australians to tell them there's a bush fire near them, to tell them what to do in a high -fire dange r day, which isn't always obvious.</p><p end="2223" is_meta="false" speaker="Genevieve Bell" start="2180">And how to think about being safer and ultimately smarter about how we inhabit a dangerous landscape . In the United States, you have the A mber alert, something I'm sure many of you hope to neve r see on your telephones . But when you do, you know what to do . It's about making a community and the kids in it hopefully safer and ultimately making all of us smarter about danger . And it will be hard to argue with what&#8217;s happened in Nepal over the la st three and a half weeks as people have mobilized all sorts of technology to bring both relief and comfort to a community that was clearly struggling . In all of those cases, is smart technology making us dumber? I hardly think so . And if you were to mo ve further out from that frame and think about cultural knowledge, we talked a lot about intelligence, we talked a lot about book learning . But let's think a little bit about cultural knowledge .</p><p end="2290" is_meta="false" speaker="Genevieve Bell" start="2223">I'm the child of an anthropologist. I grew up with indigenous people in Australia. I spent a lot of time in indigenous communities, and it's been fascinating to watch over the last 20 years asIntelligence Squared: 18 5/14/15 Smart Technology i s Making Us Dumb</p><p end="2290" is_meta="false" speaker="Genevieve Bell" start="2223">those communities have embraced new technologies to do old things . The Ngadjuri with whom</p><p end="2290" is_meta="false" speaker="Genevieve Bell" start="2223">my family have worked for the last 20 years, used the internet to tell their stories . They like the fact that newspapers are being archived because they can use the stories in those about their colonial contact and argue about how t o regain their land. The Diri and the Kukuda [spelled phonetically] are using IOT sensors to combine traditional knowledge about climate with state -</p><p end="2290" is_meta="false" speaker="Genevieve Bell" start="2223">based knowledge about climate change to think about how to occupy their land better . And the Anangu in central Australia have an electronic medical records system that is a marvel of the world and has changed the health outcomes in that community . Is smart tech, in those instances, making those communities dumber? I hardly think so. And is it about a vacuum and people just talking to each other? I don't think that's the right way to think about it, either .</p><p end="2290" is_meta="false" speaker="Genevieve Bell" start="2223">Moving closer to home, at Intel, we're deeply concerned about diversity in the tech community,</p><p end="2290" is_meta="false" speaker="Genevieve Bell" start="2223">about diversity in STEM educ ation . And one of our challenges frequently is to convince young women and ethnic minorities that there's room for them inside the sciences .</p><p end="2349" is_meta="false" speaker="Genevieve Bell" start="2290">And one of the ways you do that is by telling the stories of people who've been there before .</p><p end="2349" is_meta="false" speaker="Genevieve Bell" start="2290">Findi ng the stories of women pioneers and under -represented minorities who were pioneers used to be difficult. It's nice to be in New York for me . I get to go visit Judy Chicago's dinner table at the Brooklyn M useum, and I think about how hard it was for her to reclaim all of those women's names and how much easier it is to do it today . My Twitter feed just recently brought me the name of Sharla Boheim [spelled phonetically] who actually was the original lead name on pocket -- packet simulation technology . You don't need to know what it is, but it's the foundation of the internet. And she was involved . Until quite recently, people didn't know that. So is using smart technology to tell our stories and tell them widely and bring more people into the conversation making us dumb? I certainly hope not, because it's something I participate in regularly . And almost last but by no means least, let's tackle the notion of community and citizenship. Andrew brought it up. Let's take it on a little bit more seriously .</p><p end="2349" is_meta="false" speaker="Genevieve Bell" start="2290">What have we used smart technology for from the last 18 months to think about notions of citizenship beyond the United States and within it?</p><p end="2408" is_meta="false" speaker="Genevieve Bell" start="2349">Were the students who were protesting at Mong Kok in Hong Kong say that smart technology was making them dumb?

And we watched the video rocket around America and drive yet a further conversation about race and violence , an d what it means to be a citizen? We can dismiss hashtag activism -- such a great phrase -- as being a sort of a fleeting thing, right ? Whether it's #blacklivesmatter, #notallmen, #SOSblack Australia from my hometown . But truthfully the use of technology to propel conversations about citizenship is hardly new . A photograph made a huge difference in how we talked about the Vietnam War . The radio and vinyl records, whichIntelligence Squared: 19 5/14/15 Smart Technology i s Making Us Dumb</p><p end="2408" is_meta="false" speaker="Genevieve Bell" start="2349">are making a comeback, I'll have you know, helped distribute the word of Martin Luther King .</p><p end="2408" is_meta="false" speaker="Genevieve Bell" start="2349">And the suffragettes really liked a good typewriter.</p><p end="2531" is_meta="false" speaker="Genevieve Bell" start="2408">So is smart technology in those cases making us dumb? I don't think so . Does it mean we still have a lot of work to do as citizens? Absolutely . And lest I end on a depressing note, because I realize being told you have more work is depressing, let me just reflect briefly on something else . Smart technology is also in our everyday lives . And some of those things we may not think about as making us smart, but they're certainly chang ing, I would argue, for the better personhood . Here's my last example: Online dating, because you should end on a good note .</p><p end="2531" is_meta="false" speaker="Genevieve Bell" start="2408">When I was in India doing fieldwork many years ago, a place that had been embracing this technology for a long time, a woman said to me, "Getting a husband is just a database problem."</p><p end="2531" is_meta="true" speaker="Genevieve Bell" start="2408">laughter</p><p end="2531" is_meta="false" speaker="Genevieve Bell" start="2408">And she said the matrimonial time -- matrimonial classified section of the Times of India c hanged everything for us because the database got bigger .

This is a pyramid that was constructed that was -- somebody came up with, R ussell Ackoff , I think , in the 1990s .</p><p end="2657" is_meta="false" speaker="David Weinberger" start="2594">And it's become canon that I think that it is not -- it's a nice metaphor, but it's actually a wrong metaphor. The idea is, it's a pyramid, right? Many of you have seen this . Businesses put up,</p><p end="2657" is_meta="false" speaker="David Weinberger" start="2594">like every hour that diagram is drawn on some business law somewhere . Data information knowledge, wisdom . It's a pyramid because the idea is tha t knowledge is a matter -- we think knowledge is a matter of filtering out information .</p><p end="2713" is_meta="false" speaker="David Weinberger" start="2657">So we start with broad -based data . That gets filtered out. What's worthy information is -- in data becomes information and so on up the path . And certainly wisdom does not work that way . Wisdom doesn't make sense in that if you think about it for a moment. And I also don't think knowledge works that way either . Knowledge is not a filtering of information . In fact, let me -- [unintelligible] the information itself is very suspect.</p><p end="2769" is_meta="false" speaker="Nicholas Carr" start="2713">Absolutely, there's a whole lot more information.</p><p end="2769" is_meta="false" speaker="Nicholas Carr" start="2713">T he question is, how do we think?</p><p end="2769" is_meta="false" speaker="David Weinberger" start="2713">Again, so it would be insane to say that we invented knowledge in the 1990s, somewhere [unintelligible] . The diagram in which we think that this is how the filtration process works I think is fundamentally misleading, that knowledge is not a filtering of information .</p><p end="2827" is_meta="false" speaker="David Weinberger" start="2769">It's a social process -- sorry, the epistemological chaos that -- it is somewhat chaotic . It's a social process in which we engage with one another . We -- knowledge is based in large part upon social -- relationships and makes social relationships . The computer based model of the brain that you and most of our culture accepts I think is highly suspect . And if we look past going -- you know, scanning down your Facebook feed to see what's new and think about the times in which we actually do form knowledge, this new ecosystem, which I totally agree with you, we now have, i s in fact spectacularly good for the formation of knowledge.</p><p end="2827" is_meta="false" speaker="David Weinberger" start="2769">John Donvan:Intelligence Squared: 22 5/14/15 Smart Technology i s Making Us Dumb</p><p end="2827" is_meta="false" speaker="David Weinberger" start="2769">Let's bring in Andrew Carr [sic] .

And I tend to think that we even have to distinguish data from information . And I certainly -- you know, I bow down to Nick in this ar ea from a scientific and an epistemological point of view . But this overpowering nature of data is troubling in all sorts of ways . And perhaps most troubling of all -- Nick pointed to this -- was while we're all drowning in data,</p><p end="2898" is_meta="false" speaker="Andrew Keen" start="2827">most of it extremely irrelevant at best -- inane, vulgar -- a tiny handful of Silicon Valley companies, most notably Google and Facebook, are making fortunes out of that data, not because it's correct, not because it has any value to civilization, not because it's solving problems in Africa, but because they're selling advertising around it .Intelligence Squared: 23 5/14/15 Smart Technology i s Making Us Dumb</p><p end="2952" is_meta="false" speaker="Andrew Keen" start="2898">So there is a double vulgarity here, and I would much rather talk about a big data economy than an information economy.</p><p end="2952" is_meta="false" speaker="Genevieve Bell" start="2898">Well, I mean, I would make the argument that some of that data has been extraordinary in what it has revealed . I mean, you know, let's think about Snowden and Chelsea Manning . Let's think about the Sony leaks . I mean, you know, whether we can argue about the legality of those, but the data that they generated revealed things about the contours of the world writ large and the world writ small, and made clear all manner of things that we might want as citizens, as human beings, as women to argue about.</p><p end="3017" is_meta="false" speaker="Genevieve Bell" start="2952">O h indeed.

We are having a debate about whether smart technology makes us dumb. And I think, you know, the argument there is not about surveillance , but about, "Does the prevalence of data always mean we are drowning?"</p><p end="3017" is_meta="false" speaker="Nicholas Carr" start="2952">We read in different ways, and they're all valuable . On way of reading is skimming. If you open a magazine or newspaper, you do a lot of skimming . But then, particularly when you have a book or a news -- printed newspaper or something in front of you, you also -- when something interests you, you move to a much deeper form of reading where you're not skimming .</p><p end="3069" is_meta="false" speaker="Nicholas Carr" start="3017">You're actually reading . You're going line by line . And what research into how people read when they're looking at their phones or their computer shows is that skimming becomes the default, the dominant form of reading . And, in fact, you -- if you look at the research, the researchers talk about the F pattern by which they mean that people -- when they -- when people read on a computer screen, they go across the first couple of lines of text all the way,</p><p end="3069" is_meta="false" speaker="Nicholas Carr" start="3017">and then their eyes drift down the margin a little bit. And then they go about halfway across the text, and then their eyes just drift down the rest of the margin, so it forms this F pattern.</p><p end="3069" is_meta="false" speaker="Nicholas Carr" start="3017">And then you click, and you go somewhere else . So s kimming is fine in context. Better and more important is actually reading deeply, whether it's fiction or nonfiction or anything . That's when you get deeply engaged. That's when you learn stuff, and that's the kind of reading that we're losing, thanks t o our smart technologies.</p><p end="3129" is_meta="false" speaker="Nicholas Carr" start="3069">I don't think we're arguing that the mind is dying .

And that's all good . The question is, on balance, is this making us dumber or smarter? And I think there is, at this point, a lot of research . There's a great study that came out of Stanford, w here the researchers got two groups of people . One group spends a lot of time online, a lot of time multi- tasking. One group didn't. They gave them six basic,</p><p end="3129" is_meta="false" speaker="Nicholas Carr" start="3069">fundamental tests of cognitive function. The heavy multi-taskers did worse on all six tests . And one of the most revealing tests was how well people are able to distinguish important information from trivia. And on that test, the heavy multi -taskers, heavy users of smart technology, did very poorly .</p><p end="-32809" is_meta="false" speaker="Nicholas Carr" start="3129">Intelligence Squared: 25 5/14/15 Smart Technology i s Making Us Dumb</p><p end="-32809" is_meta="false" speaker="Nicholas Carr" start="3129">And what the researchers theorized is that what happens is we train ourselves not to pay attention to what's important, but simply to pay attention to what's new . So, when your phone goes off, when it buzzes, whatever, it can be the most trivial thing in the world, but that's wha t grabs your --</p><p end="-32809" is_meta="false" speaker="Nicholas Carr" start="3129">-- attention.</p><p end="-32809" is_meta="false" speaker="Nicholas Carr" start="3129">And we begin to lose that fundamental ability to even think about what we should be thinking about.</p><p end="-32809" is_meta="false" speaker="Genevieve Bell" start="3129">I'm not sure I'm willing to dispute it, but I'm willing to suggest that, you know, we're at a very --</p><p end="-32809" is_meta="false" speaker="Genevieve Bell" start="3129">it may not feel like it to many of us in this room -- Nick obviously the exception, having only had a smartphone for six months .

And then I thi nk the second question is, I am also interested in what those studies look like beyond the United States, and about what it means to not keep reducing smart technology down to Facebook, Google, Twitter, and a phone , when in fact, we know that the technolog ies that are in people's worlds that are smart are far beyond that . And the impact of those, I think, is much more complex.Intelligence Squared: 26 5/14/15 Smart Technology i s Making Us Dumb</p><p end="3252" is_meta="false" speaker="Andrew Keen" start="-32809">I'm very suspicious of Genevieve's sort of argument about the non -Western world .</p><p end="3369" is_meta="false" speaker="Andrew Keen" start="3252">We saw the same, indeed, with the Occupy movement in the United States .

There's no consequence. There's no depth. The very depth that Nick talks about in epistemological terms is also missing in social and political term s.

But the internet proved itself not only to be a superb tool for organizing,</p><p end="3550" is_meta="false" speaker="David Weinberger" start="3437">for organizing people without a leader, which is a pretty remarkable thing . This was a leaderless organization .</p><p end="3611" is_meta="false" speaker="David Weinberger" start="3550">It also, I noticed, from talking with people from Tunisia, they credit, at least in part, the internet with giving them the idea of freedom, the sense that they can have a voice . They should have a voice . They are -- it is their right as citizens because they can do it on the net. Why ca n't they do it in public for their government? And I will use the word; that is empowering . And so they use the internet in a complex environment . They organize, they, in some senses, in some places, they won, and then larger forces came . It turns out that what we now know is that the internet is really g reat at leaderless organization , but doesn't necessarily always lead to the next stage of governing . So that --</p><p end="3611" is_meta="true" speaker="David Weinberger" start="3550">talking simultaneously</p><p end="3611" is_meta="false" speaker="Nicholas Carr" start="3550">I think the internet is a communication platform . And you can communicate good stuff, and you can communicate bad stuff. You can communicate healthcare information, as Genevieve said, or you can be ISIS and send out YouTube videos of beheadings as a recrui tment tool.</p><p end="3670" is_meta="false" speaker="Nicholas Carr" start="3611">You can -- you can organize antigovernment protests or you can be the government using the technology to track those protesters and throwing -- throw them in jail. So I don't think you can -- I don't think you can leap to the ass umption that even as a basic communication platform this is something that is naturally or inclined to be a good thing that raises people up and lets them think deeper thoughts . I think it can do both things , as all communication platforms do . And I think we really have to -- have to look at what -- how the technology influences what we do with the communications, how it influences our relationship to our thinking and to one another . And there, I think the picture is much darker.</p><p end="3670" is_meta="false" speaker="David Weinberger" start="3611">So, yes, internet is just a communication platform, but it's not just a communication platform .</p><p end="3670" is_meta="false" speaker="David Weinberger" start="3611">It has particular, as they say, af fordances, things that it's good at. And so if you're on the internet, you are very likely going to learn some things beyond that you can communicate .</p><p end="3730" is_meta="false" speaker="David Weinberger" start="3670">You will learn that you can talk . You can speak. The entire world can listen . This is so different than it was 20 years ago . Anybody anywhere can talk and the entire world can listen . They</p><p end="3730" is_meta="false" speaker="David Weinberger" start="3670">may not, but they can . It is an environment where you can speak without permission, and it's an environment that is linked. Links are like the new punctuation. They're --</p><p end="3730" is_meta="false" speaker="David Weinberger" start="3670">instead of putting a full stop or a half stop, you put a connecti on. This type of new punctuation is transformative in our idea of how things go together and our agency in doing so . So I don't think it's just a communication platform, and I think that you can generally learn some things just by using the internet. It does help shape some of those ideas.</p><p end="3730" is_meta="false" speaker="Andrew Keen" start="3670">I think, again, we have to be very, very careful here, David . You said the internet allows people to talk as if somehow in the pre -internet age, before computers, peo ple couldn't talk.</p><p end="3792" is_meta="false" speaker="Andrew Keen" start="3730">Intelligence Squared: 31 5/14/15 Smart Technology i s Making Us Dumb</p><p end="3792" is_meta="false" speaker="Andrew Keen" start="3730">It's that kind of argument which I think puts the digital camp in trouble , because the reality is, is that we always talk ed. The digital platform certainly does enable us to talk . It certainly enables us to get a global a udience. But the reality, of co urse -- and McLuhan came out with this in his ironically termed "Global Village," is the ironic nature of the internet is it's not global. The ironic nature of the internet, okay, the wires are -- everywhere yo u go, it's the same -- it's the same technology and everyone's on the same platform . But the reality is study after study has shown -- as shown in an excellent book called "The Filter Bubble," the reality is that we're talking to fewer and fewer people . So if anything, I'm not going to -- I'm not going to fall into your dystopian/ Utopian trap. But if anything, we're talking less now than we were before the invention of the internet.</p><p end="3853" is_meta="false" speaker="David Weinberger" start="3792">So, Andrew, you have to hear the complete sentence . What I said is it enables us to talk, and the entire world to listen . And that is new. And as I said, not everybody in the world will -- let me --</p><p end="3853" is_meta="false" speaker="Andrew Keen" start="3792">[unintelligible] not listening . That's the point. I mean, you could argue, if I shout loud enough,</p><p end="3853" is_meta="false" speaker="Andrew Keen" start="3792">the entire world could hear.</p><p end="3853" is_meta="false" speaker="David Weinberger" start="3792">Then you should have listened to the second sentence after that, in which I said, it doesn't mean that anybody is listening . So yes, filter bubble --</p><p end="3853" is_meta="false" speaker="Nicholas Carr" start="3792">It also doesn't --</p><p end="3853" is_meta="false" speaker="David Weinberger" start="3792">[unintelligible] we hear filter bubble is a serious issue to worry about, needs to be addressed somehow . And, yes, Andrew, of course, not everybo dy hears what you're saying.</p><p end="3917" is_meta="false" speaker="David Weinberger" start="3853">But compared to the prior media regime, the ability for -- which was basically, if you wanted people to hear you, you put it -- you wrote a letter to the editor, and you're lucky if it got printed . And if it did, it went to your community . The ability for people to talk and to say uninteresting -- things that are interesting to them, b ut maybe not interesting to you -- and that matters . The ability of people to talk and address the world is new, and it is -- it is transformative.</p><p end="3917" is_meta="false" speaker="Genevieve Bell" start="3853">Wait .

Genevieve talked about, you know, that the internet may be making us dumb or that smart technology may be m aking us dumb now, or at least what's the evidence suggests but at some future, it'll make us smart . David talks about the fact that we -- that anybody can communicate anything to anyone else now .</p><p end="3965" is_meta="false" speaker="Nicholas Carr" start="3917">But what he doesn't talk about is what actua lly people use the internet for, for communicating .</p><p end="3965" is_meta="false" speaker="Nicholas Carr" start="3917">We're not all broadcasting these deep thoughts .

We have to -- in order to answer the question before us, we have to look at how this technology has actually evolved, how people are actually using it now, not some Utopian dream of how it can be used, and how that reflects on the depth o f the thought it is inspiring in us.</p><p end="3965" is_meta="false" speaker="Genevieve Bell" start="3917">I think it has .

And I think sometimes using dumb is a way of talking about some other things . It's -- buried in that is notions about what is appropriate discourse, what is sufficiently merit -worthy, what is -- and,</p><p end="4029" is_meta="false" speaker="Genevieve Bell" start="3965">you know, this is a place where, truthfully, you know, although David and I both fundamentally and violently disagree that smart devices are making us dumb, we do come at this from two very different positions . And mine is very much about saying, "Listen, there are lots of things that pe ople do with technology in this current moment that may not rise to the bar of tenured faculty and book writers .&#8221; That doesn't necessarily mean it's dumb.

We tend to go out, and we read and look at those kind of points of view that reinforce our own biases . SoIntelligence Squared: 35 5/14/15 Smart Technology i s Making Us Dumb</p><p end="4156" is_meta="false" speaker="Nicholas Carr" start="4086">often it's not -- the dream was that we'd use the Internet to challenge ourselves . In fact, what most people do is they go out and find stuff that confirms their existing biases, and that mak es those biases even stronger.</p><p end="4156" is_meta="false" speaker="Andrew Keen" start="4086">And let me just jump on your question in terms of --</p><p end="4156" is_meta="false" speaker="Andrew Keen" start="4086">-- this data points, this idea that knowledge is simply join the dots or join the data dots . It's more complex than that. As Nick is saying, what we're losing is the subtlety, the depth, the sophistication of thought . In an odd way perhaps we're becoming like our machines . But that in an odd way as well makes us dumber than we once were.</p><p end="4208" is_meta="false" speaker="David Weinberger" start="4156">Oh, so much to respond to.</p><p end="4208" is_meta="false" speaker="David Weinberger" start="4156">Okay . I shouldn't have said that. Dang it.</p><p end="4208" is_meta="false" speaker="David Weinberger" start="4156">So, to Nick's point that we're -- we use the net to talk about things that aren't interesting, I think it's actually an argument against language itself , because most of what we use language for is to talk about things that are not broadly interesting . We seek out sites that we agree with in part because we fall prey to this filter bubble and confirmation bias thing, but also because when we want to -- that's how understanding works . When we want to understand s omething,</p><p end="4208" is_meta="false" speaker="David Weinberger" start="4156">we go -- to understand it is to fit it into our context. That's maybe a bug in how understanding works, but it is how understanding works . So it actually makes sense when you have a questionIntelligence Squared: 36 5/14/15 Smart Technology i s Making Us Dumb</p><p end="4208" is_meta="false" speaker="David Weinberger" start="4156">to go to a site where your fundamental principles and context are shared so you can make sense of what they're saying . That's just how understanding works.</p><p end="4268" is_meta="false" speaker="Nicholas Carr" start="4208">Sure . I think they're -- I think the negative effects influence people of all ages, 80 -year -olds as well as 10 -year -olds . But I do think it's particularly dangerous for young children whose -- we know t heir brains are in the process of being formed.</p><p end="4340" is_meta="false" speaker="Nicholas Carr" start="4268">And we also know that the best thing you can do for a child is to give them lots of different experiences, interacting with the world in lots of different ways, playing with clay, doing -- you k now, interacting with people face -to -face . And what we're doing often with a -- with even ever younger children is putting more and more of their attention on screens . And we're seeing this in schools, we're seeing it out of schools. And I think it 's hard to conclude, from what we know about child development, that kind of giving this more and more constrained way of interacting with the world is going to produce broader -minded, more curious children . I think it's going to have the opposite effect.</p><p end="4340" is_meta="false" speaker="Genevieve Bell" start="4268">Yeah . I mean, I think --Intelligence Squared: 37 5/14/15 Smart Technology i s Making Us Dumb</p><p end="4340" is_meta="false" speaker="Genevieve Bell" start="4268">-- there are a couple of things that run through that, right? Is we have a persistent anxiety about the impact of new technologies on our children. This one has a particular kind of visceral- ness to it . I'm willing to bet many of your parents worried about the impact of radio,</p><p end="4340" is_meta="false" speaker="Genevieve Bell" start="4268">rock and roll, television on all of us . The jury is in some ways still out on rock and roll,</p><p end="4340" is_meta="false" speaker="Genevieve Bell" start="4268">obviously, but not the rest.</p><p end="4340" is_meta="true" speaker="Genevieve Bell" start="4268">laughter</p><p end="4387" is_meta="false" speaker="Genevieve Bell" start="4340">And there's something about why it is that we worry about technology and children in partic ular. And I think, you know, there are reasons to suggest -- and Nick's right on this -- that a diversity of experiences is a good thing . The challenge, however, here, is also beyond the kind of notion that every child is born with a smart device in one hand, and only a thumb in the other . The reality is that in lots of places in the world, kids are not using new technology . In lots of places in the world, there are cultures about how technology is introduced into children that suggests that, you know, you may be disadvantaged because there are other places -- if that's your fear -- that this is not happening . But I think it's a hard one to argue, right, is to say,</p><p end="4387" is_meta="false" speaker="Genevieve Bell" start="4340">"Is, you know, technology pernicious and bad for children?" Well, it's an argument that's been rehearsed for nearly 200 years . And I think all of you are living proof in the room that rock and roll didn't rot your brains.</p><p end="4449" is_meta="false" speaker="Genevieve Bell" start="4387">Well, you know --</p><p end="4449" is_meta="true" speaker="Genevieve Bell" start="4387">laughter</p><p end="4449" is_meta="false" speaker="Genevieve Bell" start="4387">-- fair point . We could always go look for some countries that didn't have it and see what the comparative state is.</p><p end="4449" is_meta="false" speaker="Nicholas Carr" start="4387">No . I don't. I mean, I think deep thinking is deep thinking, whether you apply it to a poem or to a scientific problem. I do think -- I mean, and that's not to say there aren't good things about being able to exchange information very quickly . I think science advances a lot -- in many cases,</p><p end="4449" is_meta="false" speaker="Nicholas Carr" start="4387">by being able to exchange information quickly .</p><p end="4507" is_meta="false" speaker="Nicholas Carr" start="4449">So that's a good thing about the Internet. But you come back to the point that we are having more and more trouble screening out distractions and interruptions, and really thinking deeply about something , which means concentrating our focus and concentrating our mind. And that's every bit as important to scientific discovery as it is to the humanities, right?</p><p end="4507" is_meta="false" speaker="Andrew Keen" start="4449">And I think it's important to add that both science --</p><p end="4507" is_meta="false" speaker="Andrew Keen" start="4449">-- and the humanities are victims of this technology . So, supporters of the smart technology often point to Wikipedia and say, "Well, Wikipedia is the example of how smart technology works .&#8221; But all the research on Wikipedia in dicates that the content there isn't very reliable .</p><p end="4507" is_meta="false" speaker="Andrew Keen" start="4449">So, for example, when it comes to the medical information on Wikipedia, a board of doctors who researched this found that nine out of 10 articles on Wikipedia about medical were inaccurate, which is obviously particularly troubling .</p><p end="4575" is_meta="false" speaker="Andrew Keen" start="4507">So, I think we have to be careful to believe that somehow, smart technology generates reliable,</p><p end="4575" is_meta="false" speaker="Andrew Keen" start="4507">scientific information, but not information about the humanities . I think it's --</p><p end="4575" is_meta="false" speaker="Andrew Keen" start="4507">David Weinberger:Intelligence Squared: 39 5/14/15 Smart Technology i s Making Us Dumb</p><p end="4575" is_meta="false" speaker="Andrew Keen" start="4507">Listen --</p><p end="4575" is_meta="false" speaker="David Weinberger" start="4507">So, if I understand your question correctly, if we look into the sciences, we see that smart technology has enabled a rapid advance of those sciences . What we're doing now would be absolutely impossible without the Internet. And not simply because of the rapid communication . It's really important -- but also because it has enabled -- things have grown up that enabled sophisticated collaboration. Management of gigantic multinational projects . It's enabled a type of iterative knowledge as well, in which ideas are put forward, and then iterated on in public . And this is actually a pretty new form of knowledge . It can be done at scale . The Internet is enabling open access, which is the movement that -- the idea that scientific research and research in the humanities, academic research should be available for free to anybody online .</p><p end="4634" is_meta="false" speaker="David Weinberger" start="4575">This is peer -reviewed, but not put it into academic journals that can ch arge 20 or $25,000 for a subscription, which is driving our libraries into great despair. And so, this ecosystem that Nick refers to , which I think is the right word, is in fact one that is extremely -- is enabling science to proceed , and research in gene ral can proceed at tremendous pace and enabling it to get deeper and deeper and more and more complex . I just don't know the people, Nick, who don't think deeply, who don't have a moment to think, who are distracted by their thumbs, that they don't -- who ? I don't meet them . I see so much more deep thinking out in the world than I --</p><p end="4634" is_meta="false" speaker="Genevieve Bell" start="4575">So two [unintelligible].</p><p end="4749" is_meta="false" speaker="Nicholas Carr" start="4634">I think there's no question that if you need to get an answer to a well -defined question, that there's nothing so good as Google or Tweeting it out there or whatever . And again, that's one of the good things about the technology . But deep thought in the -- and I'm back to this again .</p><p end="4749" is_meta="false" speaker="Nicholas Carr" start="4634">Deep intelligence isn't about getting precise answers to well- defined questions. It's being able to know , what are the big questions you should ask ?</p><p end="4814" is_meta="false" speaker="Nicholas Carr" start="4749">How do you fit this informa tion together to form conceptual knowledge, to get big -picture knowledge? And if you spend all your time Googling and grabbing information, you might think you're smart . In fact, there was a very interesting study that came out just a couple of months ag o that -- that showed that people tend to think they're smarter because they're Googling all the time, and they confuse what's on Google with what's in their own brains . And as one of the researchers said, we have this weird -- we're in this weird time wh ere we seem to be getting dumber, but we are thinking that we're smarter . And that's kind of the illusion that this -- being wrapped in this information often provides . But, you know, we have to make that distinction between getting quick answers from Wi kipedia maybe, or from Google or whatever, and being smarter. And I don't think they're the same thing.</p><p end="4814" is_meta="false" speaker="Genevieve Bell" start="4749">So, listen, I mean, Nick, I think it's interesting, right . You&#8217;ll concede to the notion that a well -</p><p end="4814" is_meta="false" speaker="Genevieve Bell" start="4749">fo rmed question is an appropriate way to engage with a piece of technology .</p><p end="4874" is_meta="false" speaker="Genevieve Bell" start="4814">I'd sort of suggest that being able to form a well -formed question is an act of intelligence, right,</p><p end="4874" is_meta="false" speaker="Genevieve Bell" start="4814">being able to work out what the information is you want to extrac t and find the app that does it suggests a level of engagement with the world that's not about dumbness . I mean, I think it's coming back to this for me, right, is how are you framing "dumb" and it's opposition and what that means, right. If you're a new mom trying to work out, is this not sleeping thing a good thing or a bad thing, and when do a worry? Those are questions that technology may be able to save you quicker than calling your own parent because she's in a different country . Is that about making you more dumb ? I don't think so. So there's something for me again about how we are framing the notion of dumbness and its opposition that I keep coming back to, right.</p><p end="4874" is_meta="false" speaker="Genevieve Bell" start="4814">John Donvan:Intelligence Squared: 42 5/14/15 Smart Technology i s Making Us Dumb</p><p end="4874" is_meta="false" speaker="Genevieve Bell" start="4814">David, hold up one second. I want another response to come from the other side . Nick.</p><p end="4874" is_meta="false" speaker="Nicholas Carr" start="4814">Let's look at the question of how well we -- how well formed our questions are . There's an interesting interview just recently with a top search engineer at Google . And he was going through how much better the search engine has gotten in anticipating what we need and stuff.</p><p end="4938" is_meta="false" speaker="Nicholas Carr" start="4874">And the interviewer said, "So I assume that as the -- as Google search engine has gotten smarter, people's questions have also gotten smarter.&#8221; And he said -- he laughed and said, "No ,</p><p end="4938" is_meta="false" speaker="Nicholas Carr" start="4874">it's exactly the opposite . People get lazier and lazier.&#8221; And this shows how we become dependent on the technology to do our thinking for us . And as a result, we get lazy, we fall victim to what scientists call automation complacency. You just simply think, let the machine do it for us . So even the formation of questions, we seem to be getting worse and worse as the searching gets better and better.</p><p end="4938" is_meta="false" speaker="David Weinberger" start="4874">So --</p><p end="4938" is_meta="true" speaker="David Weinberger" start="4874">a pplause</p><p end="4938" is_meta="false" speaker="David Weinberger" start="4874">As I understand it, Nick, what's actually going on with the searches is that they've gotten much longer . People actually type, "What is --" you know, the whole question with the question mark at the end, because that now works . Whereas before, the well -- for ming a question well with Google meant figuring out what were the terms that Google wanted that would give you back the right results . It wasn't about good question forming, it was about being -- it was Google knowledge, you know, knowing how Google worke d.</p><p end="4992" is_meta="false" speaker="David Weinberger" start="4938">But I think that your comments about people Googling and they think that they're smart is that you're actually, I think, repeating Socrates' mistake which is, you know, really good company to be in . But in the P haedrus I'm sure yo u know this is in the Phaedrus Socrates makes a terrible mistake, doesn't make a lot -- a terrible mistake . He's wondering about the smart tech of his time, which was writing things down . It was literacy. And he said, "This is terrible because our memory will fail. We'll get much worse at remembering things .&#8221; And he was absolutely right about that, because if anybody here would like to stand up and recite "The Illiad" by heart,</p><p end="4992" is_meta="false" speaker="David Weinberger" start="4938">please do so and show me wrong . But generally, our memory has gotten much smaller than it -</p><p end="4992" is_meta="false" speaker="David Weinberger" start="4938">- than it was . So he was right about that, but he was wrong about the effect of literacy . TheIntelligence Squared: 43 5/14/15 Smart Technology i s Making Us Dumb</p><p end="4992" is_meta="false" speaker="David Weinberger" start="4938">effect of literacy has in fact made our memory a thousand times better. We know so -- we remember so much more as a species .</p><p end="5049" is_meta="false" speaker="Andrew Keen" start="4992">But that w asn&#8217;t Nick&#8217;s point. I think just to speak -- no, but you're the one who brought up Socrates, right? And so I can bring him up too.</p><p end="5049" is_meta="true" speaker="Andrew Keen" start="4992">l aughte r</p><p end="5049" is_meta="false" speaker="David Weinberger" start="4992">I was making a point, though, so --</p><p end="5049" is_meta="false" speaker="Andrew Keen" start="4992">Well, no, but you brought Socrates up, so I'm going to -- I'm going to &#8211;</p><p end="5049" is_meta="true" speaker="Andrew Keen" start="4992">laughter</p><p end="5049" is_meta="false" speaker="Andrew Keen" start="4992">I'm going to bring him up too . So what was -- Socrates is great, his contribution . Nick was jus t saying that while the problems with Google or our search -centric culture is people are increasingly lazy . And what they're really lazy about is asking questions . What we're having is the automation of the act of asking a question. And that is one of the consequences or casualties of this digital revolution . And, of course, Socrates' greatest -- one of his greatest contributions to our culture was in the art of asking the question. That was the whole point of his philosophy, was it was about asking questions .</p><p end="5112" is_meta="false" speaker="Andrew Keen" start="5049">That's what knowledge was, asking questions . And as Nick has made it clear, we have forgotten, or we are forgetting how to ask questions, and that's extremely troubling.</p><p end="5112" is_meta="false" speaker="David Weinberger" start="5049">So the other criticism -- the other criticism or fear that Socrates had in that dialogue about writing was that written stuff is never as good as in person, face to face, because the written thing will not respond to you. You can't ask it a question. And the internet is not a series of answers . It's a series of conversations of various form s. And now we are able to engage in conversations about any topic, whether it's about epistemological chaos, or it's about whetherIntelligence Squared: 44 5/14/15 Smart Technology i s Making Us Dumb</p><p end="5112" is_meta="false" speaker="David Weinberger" start="5049">a Mini Cooper is any good in the winter in Boston .

What I'm arguing about is how we think today, thanks to our dependency on our smartphones and our computers and our dependency on social media, and looking at the evidence . And the evidence is -- and you can certainly understand why pe ople who are cut out from the technology would want in, but that doesn't change the fact of how we actually use the technology and how we behave with it , and how it influences our thinking . And the studies and the research and the science points to the fa ct that we are, in fact, turning into scatterbrains . And, you know, it may well be that Cuba will get all of this technology, and they'll enjoy many benefits from it, but they'll probably have this same debate there in 10 years or 15 years or whatever, be cause they'll realize that there's a lot that's lost as well as what's gained.</p><p end="5285" is_meta="false" speaker="Genevieve Bell" start="5239">Well, there's something kind of extraordinary in the notion that it's good for people to want in but only if they want in on your ter ms.

My vision, my point would be that actually what we've done is created this technological environment, both because of the interests o f companies like Google and Facebook and Intel , to get us to be constantly interacting with our computer screens, constantly distracted and interrupted, and also becauseIntelligence Squared: 47 5/14/15 Smart Technology i s Making Us Dumb</p><p end="5347" is_meta="false" speaker="Nicholas Carr" start="5285">we have inside our brains this primitive desire, well- documented, to want to know everything that's going on around us, probably because it helped save your life, you know, eons ago .</p><p end="5417" is_meta="false" speaker="Nicholas Carr" start="5347">But we combine this commercial desire to keep people distracted with our own kind of proclivity to want to be distracted .

You remember, or most of you should remember, in Plato's "Republic ," Socrates' definition of intelligence was bound up in his notion of the cave and of being able to distinguish illusion from truth. And his argument in the "Republic" was that we were mostly looking at shadows in his cave .

And the ability to participate in the creation of knowledge , whether this is by asking questions -- dumb questions, smart questions -- by posing wrong ideas and bad ideas and finding how the world reacts, by participating in a more genuine way and learning from people, by lurking on lists and seeing what people are saying -- where lurking means watching but not talking; i t's not the bad lurking.</p><p end="5717" is_meta="false" speaker="David Weinberger" start="5663">We've never had to take a --</p><p end="5717" is_meta="true" speaker="David Weinberger" start="5663">laughter</p><p end="5717" is_meta="false" speaker="David Weinberger" start="5663">-- course at a major university for free, to read open access journals, where most of the best physics in the world, the best math in the world is being done . To think that this is not theIntelligence Squared: 50 5/14/15 Smart Technology i s Making Us Dumb</p><p end="5717" is_meta="false" speaker="David Weinberger" start="5663">greatest age to be -- to want to know things strikes me as crazy, as crazy . No matter what facts you point at, and brain chemistry, et cetera -- all I -- well, none of which I deny .</p><p end="5769" is_meta="false" speaker="David Weinberger" start="5717">N evertheless, if the question is, is smart technology making us dumb, I think, just looking at what is there should tell us no . This is the smartest age we've ever had.</p><p end="5769" is_meta="false" speaker="Nicholas Carr" start="5717">Unfortunately, David, the science happens to be against you here. But we've been speaking mainly about communications and information . And I think that's a very important part of --</p><p end="5769" is_meta="false" speaker="Nicholas Carr" start="5717">about smart technology, but it's not everything . What we're seeing now is we're relying on software, relying on algorit hms to do more and more things . Not just to gather information,</p><p end="5769" is_meta="false" speaker="Nicholas Carr" start="5717">but if you're a pilot, you use them to fly .</p><p end="5838" is_meta="false" speaker="Nicholas Carr" start="5769">If you're a doctor, you use them for diagnosis . If you're just an average person, you turn on Google Maps to get around . And we want to believe that this -- by handing over tasks to our computers, we'll be raised up . We'll -- our own talents will get sharper and better . But even here, the research points to something very different happening . There was a fascinating study done in the Netherlands, a series of experiments, where people were given increasingly smart software to do difficult tasks . And what the researchers found is that as the software got smarter, the people got dumber . They got lazier. They began to become reliant on the software itself . They weren't practicing their own talents . And we can see this as well in all of those examples I talked about. David mentioned, well, aren't pilots -- shouldn't pilots have the smartest technology possible? A ctually, if you look at airline safety research, and if you look at the recent proclamations from the FAA, they're saying that over automation is actually making pilots less capable .</p><p end="5890" is_meta="false" speaker="Nicholas Carr" start="5838">And we have to remove some of the dependency on computers . You see this as well with accountants who become overly dependent on their software and lose the sharpness of their thinking . You see it with doctors who become dependent on the templates that they go through when you're in the examination room . I talked about how the Google person saw thisIntelligence Squared: 51 5/14/15 Smart Technology i s Making Us Dumb</p><p end="5890" is_meta="false" speaker="Nicholas Carr" start="5838">with search as well. Another Google top engineer put the -- put the problem very bluntly in an article . He wrote, "Sharp tools, dull minds."</p><p end="5890" is_meta="false" speaker="Genevieve Bell" start="5838">So the proposition, "Smart technology is making us dumb," it's clearly one that seduces many of you in this room.</p><p end="5957" is_meta="false" speaker="Genevieve Bell" start="5890">I watch you applaud, I watch you nod, and I know that there's an echo in it . There's something in it that always appeals . We say the same thing about many technologies over the last 200 years . And I want to make us think for just a moment here about what is that seduction? What is the anxiety that is appealed to when you applaud the notion that this technology is making us dumb? Because at beginning of this debate, most of you raised your hands that you had smart technology in your lives . Those of you who don't own it know people who do and live in worlds that are augmented by it . When you ask if anyone in the room was willing to admit to feeling dumber about it, there were o nly two of you who actually raised your hand . That makes me suspect that the number of you in the room who feel it, it's why you applaud, but you wouldn't say you did feel dumber because of it . My suspicion is that threading through all of that is a very human set of preoccupations and anxieties, an anxiety about what technology means for us, what it means for our humanity, our bodies, our competency, what it means to have new technologies in some ways threaten some of those things .</p><p end="6011" is_meta="false" speaker="Genevieve Bell" start="5957">But the reality is also, despite Nick's, in some ways, admiral notion that we should just use it less, that there is more and more technology in our lives, technology that we rely on,</p><p end="6011" is_meta="false" speaker="Genevieve Bell" start="5957">technology that some of us love, technology that many of us find valuable and us eful and instructive, that helps shape our exercise, our financial future s, that we use for banking and travel and leisure activities . And there's something in all of this about why it is that despite all of that, we like to imagine we are more dumb . I f ind it hard to imagine, sitting in a room full of New Yorkers that you secretly in your heart of hearts believe you are dumb.</p><p end="6011" is_meta="true" speaker="Genevieve Bell" start="5957">laughter</p><p end="6011" is_meta="false" speaker="Genevieve Bell" start="5957">Genevieve Bell:Intelligence Squared: 52 5/14/15 Smart Technology i s Making Us Dumb</p><p end="6011" is_meta="false" speaker="Genevieve Bell" start="5957">I may be foreign to this country, but I'm not foreign to the idea of what New York stands for .</p><p end="6011" is_meta="false" speaker="Genevieve Bell" start="5957">Likewise to a radio listening audience who will feel the same thing . So it strikes me that it's very hard to imagine that smart technology is really making all of us dumb.</p></transcript></debate>
