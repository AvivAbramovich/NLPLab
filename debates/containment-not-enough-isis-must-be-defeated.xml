This little thing called the Iran deal, getting that through Congress,</p><p end="479" is_meta="false" speaker="Mich&#232;le Flournoy" start="426">concluding an historic trade deal in Asia, but I'm confident that once those two things</p><p end="479" is_meta="false" speaker="Mich&#232;le Flournoy" start="426">are taken care of this will move to</p><p end="479" is_meta="false" speaker="Mich&#232;le Flournoy" start="426">the top of the president's nightstand reading pile.</p><p end="479" is_meta="false" speaker="Mich&#232;le Flournoy" start="426">Yes.</p><p end="547" is_meta="false" speaker="Mich&#232;le Flournoy" start="479">My partner is the brilliant Philip Zelikow.</p><p end="547" is_meta="false" speaker="Philip Zelikow" start="479">I'm afraid, John, it's not common enough, which is a shame, because I think presidents</p><p end="547" is_meta="false" speaker="Philip Zelikow" start="479">need all the help that they can get.</p><p end="600" is_meta="false" speaker="Anne-Marie Slaughter" start="547">Well, it does, but it is coincidental and that even before I was dean I've always stood for</p><p end="600" is_meta="false" speaker="Anne-Marie Slaughter" start="547">a values&#8208;</p><p end="600" is_meta="false" speaker="Anne-Marie Slaughter" start="547">based foreign policy on the grounds that when the United States acts as</p><p end="600" is_meta="false" speaker="Anne-Marie Slaughter" start="547">consistently as possible with our values, it advances our national interest and it</p><p end="600" is_meta="false" speaker="Anne-Marie Slaughter" start="547">augments our power.</p><p end="600" is_meta="false" speaker="Anne-Marie Slaughter" start="547">The</p><p end="600" is_meta="false" speaker="Anne-Marie Slaughter" start="547">foreign policy analyst extraordinaire, Dov&#8230; Zakheim.</p><p end="600" is_meta="true" speaker="Anne-Marie Slaughter" start="547">laughter</p><p end="600" is_meta="false" speaker="Dov Zakheim" start="547">It shows you how well we prepared.</p><p end="663" is_meta="true" speaker="Dov Zakheim" start="600">laughter</p><p end="663" is_meta="false" speaker="Dov Zakheim" start="600">Not</p><p end="663" is_meta="false" speaker="Dov Zakheim" start="600">anymore.</p><p end="663" is_meta="true" speaker="Dov Zakheim" start="600">laughter</p><p end="663" is_meta="false" speaker="Dov Zakheim" start="600">Yeah, there were seven of us, not including Mr. Spock, who advised George W.

Its ultimate aim is to establish a territorial caliphate that stretches across the</p><p end="840" is_meta="false" speaker="Mich&#232;le Flournoy" start="779">Muslim world.  ISIS is brutal in the extreme.  It has beheaded innocent civilians.  It has</p><p end="840" is_meta="false" speaker="Mich&#232;le Flournoy" start="779">burned</p><p end="840" is_meta="false" speaker="Mich&#232;le Flournoy" start="779">a captured Jordanian pilot alive in a cage.  It rapes women and girls and sells</p><p end="840" is_meta="false" speaker="Mich&#232;le Flournoy" start="779">them into sexual slavery.  It crucifies Christians.  It desecrates and destroys Holy sites</p><p end="840" is_meta="false" speaker="Mich&#232;le Flournoy" start="779">and antiquities.  Over the last year ISIS has established a very substantial safe haven in</p><p end="840" is_meta="false" speaker="Mich&#232;le Flournoy" start="779">Iraq and Syria, and it has recruited more</p><p end="840" is_meta="false" speaker="Mich&#232;le Flournoy" start="779">than 22,000 foreign fighters from more than</p><p end="840" is_meta="false" speaker="Mich&#232;le Flournoy" start="779">100 countries.  The scale and scope of this mobilization is unprecedented.</p><p end="902" is_meta="false" speaker="Mich&#232;le Flournoy" start="840">Thousands of these fighters have Western passports that would allow them to travel</p><p end="902" is_meta="false" speaker="Mich&#232;le Flournoy" start="840">back to Europe and to the United States without a visa.  ISIS &#8208;&#8208; its geographic ambitions</p><p end="902" is_meta="false" speaker="Mich&#232;le Flournoy" start="840">are not limited</p><p end="902" is_meta="false" speaker="Mich&#232;le Flournoy" start="840">to the Middle East.  This is a globalizing movement.  In the last year ISIS</p><p end="902" is_meta="false" speaker="Mich&#232;le Flournoy" start="840">has sought to establish footprints in places from Libya to Afghanistan, Nigeria, the</p><p end="902" is_meta="false" speaker="Mich&#232;le Flournoy" start="840">Caucasus, even Southeast Asia.  Holding territory is critical to its momentum and its</p><p end="902" is_meta="false" speaker="Mich&#232;le Flournoy" start="840">legitimacy.  It has also established a global presence on the internet</p><p end="902" is_meta="false" speaker="Mich&#232;le Flournoy" start="840">using online means</p><p end="902" is_meta="false" speaker="Mich&#232;le Flournoy" start="840">to disseminate its propaganda, recruit and radicalize followers, inspire lone&#8208;wolf</p><p end="902" is_meta="false" speaker="Mich&#232;le Flournoy" start="840">attacks.  Again, the scale is eye&#8208;watering. 90,000 social media messages each day.</p><p end="902" is_meta="false" speaker="Mich&#232;le Flournoy" start="840">90,000 a day. In some ways, ISIS could become more dangerous than Al&#8208;Qaeda. Al&#8208;</p><p end="902" is_meta="false" speaker="Mich&#232;le Flournoy" start="840">Qaeda used to assert very strict control over</p><p end="902" is_meta="false" speaker="Mich&#232;le Flournoy" start="840">who became an affiliate.</p><p end="976" is_meta="false" speaker="Mich&#232;le Flournoy" start="902">ISIS says, "Let a thousand flowers bloom. If we can inspire individuals to conduct attacks</p><p end="976" is_meta="false" speaker="Mich&#232;le Flournoy" start="902">around the world, that's great.&#8221; In fact, 10 of the 11 attacks conducted in the West since</p><p end="976" is_meta="false" speaker="Mich&#232;le Flournoy" start="902">May of 2014 have been by lone wolves. ISIS has also conducted attacks</p><p end="976" is_meta="false" speaker="Mich&#232;le Flournoy" start="902">not only in the</p><p end="976" is_meta="false" speaker="Mich&#232;le Flournoy" start="902">Middle East, but in Canada, Australia, France, Denmark, and yes, here in the United</p><p end="976" is_meta="false" speaker="Mich&#232;le Flournoy" start="902">States. In all 50 states today, there are active investigations or arrests of ISIS. If ever</p><p end="976" is_meta="false" speaker="Mich&#232;le Flournoy" start="902">there was a terrorist group that we must defeat, it is ISIS. Now, defeating ISIS will</p><p end="976" is_meta="false" speaker="Mich&#232;le Flournoy" start="902">require</p><p end="976" is_meta="false" speaker="Mich&#232;le Flournoy" start="902">an intensive &#8208;&#8208; more intensive and fully resourced campaign on the part of the</p><p end="976" is_meta="false" speaker="Mich&#232;le Flournoy" start="902">United States and our international partners. We need to intensify our diplomacy and</p><p end="976" is_meta="false" speaker="Mich&#232;le Flournoy" start="902">our military support to Sunni and other partners so that they can be empowered to defeat ISIS on the ground. Politically, that means we need intensified diplomacy to press</p><p end="976" is_meta="false" speaker="Mich&#232;le Flournoy" start="902">the Shi'a government in Baghdad, to address Sunni grievances, to devolve more</p><p end="976" is_meta="false" speaker="Mich&#232;le Flournoy" start="902">authorities and resources to the provinces, to move towards a more federal and just</p><p end="976" is_meta="false" speaker="Mich&#232;le Flournoy" start="902">Iraq.</p><p end="1022" is_meta="false" speaker="Mich&#232;le Flournoy" start="976">In Syria, we need a more robust diplomatic</p><p end="1022" is_meta="false" speaker="Mich&#232;le Flournoy" start="976">effort to set the conditions for what should</p><p end="1022" is_meta="false" speaker="Mich&#232;le Flournoy" start="976">eventually become a negotiated settlement that removes Assad from power. We need</p><p end="1022" is_meta="false" speaker="Mich&#232;le Flournoy" start="976">increased international engagement to try to keep the civil war  in Syria from</p><p end="1022" is_meta="false" speaker="Mich&#232;le Flournoy" start="976">destabilizing neighboring states, like Jordan, and Lebanon, and Turkey. Militarily, in Iraq</p><p end="1022" is_meta="false" speaker="Mich&#232;le Flournoy" start="976">we need to provide more</p><p end="1022" is_meta="false" speaker="Mich&#232;le Flournoy" start="976">support, trainers, combat advisers, equipment, close air</p><p end="1022" is_meta="false" speaker="Mich&#232;le Flournoy" start="976">support, to local partners on the ground who can take on ISIS and take back territory. To</p><p end="1022" is_meta="false" speaker="Mich&#232;le Flournoy" start="976">be clear, I am not &#8208;&#8208; we are not arguing for a large&#8208;scale U.S. military invasion of Iraq. We</p><p end="1022" is_meta="false" speaker="Mich&#232;le Flournoy" start="976">are not calling for a repeat of the</p><p end="1022" is_meta="false" speaker="Mich&#232;le Flournoy" start="976">Iraq War.</p><p end="1081" is_meta="false" speaker="Mich&#232;le Flournoy" start="1022">We are calling for intensified support to partners. In Syria &#8208;&#8208; we need to shift our</p><p end="1081" is_meta="false" speaker="Mich&#232;le Flournoy" start="1022">emphasis to producing more support to some of the groups that are already having</p><p end="1081" is_meta="false" speaker="Mich&#232;le Flournoy" start="1022">success on the ground, like the Southern Front and the Syrian Free Army. We also need</p><p end="1081" is_meta="false" speaker="Mich&#232;le Flournoy" start="1022">to refashion</p><p end="1081" is_meta="false" speaker="Mich&#232;le Flournoy" start="1022">our Train and Equip program to try to get towards the goal of a more viable</p><p end="1081" is_meta="false" speaker="Mich&#232;le Flournoy" start="1022">alternative to ISIS in a post&#8208;Assad Syria. Thinking globally, we also need to combat ISIS</p><p end="1081" is_meta="false" speaker="Mich&#232;le Flournoy" start="1022">using the full range of tools that we've developed for counterterrorism, disrupting their</p><p end="1081" is_meta="false" speaker="Mich&#232;le Flournoy" start="1022">financing, targeting their leadership, building</p><p end="1081" is_meta="false" speaker="Mich&#232;le Flournoy" start="1022">their capacity of partners in other</p><p end="1081" is_meta="false" speaker="Mich&#232;le Flournoy" start="1022">countries to try to keep ISIS from moving in. We need to work with private sector and</p><p end="1081" is_meta="false" speaker="Mich&#232;le Flournoy" start="1022">NGO partners to combat them online. And we need to address some more fundamental</p><p end="1081" is_meta="false" speaker="Mich&#232;le Flournoy" start="1022">conditions that create fertile soil for ISIS, such as poor governance and community</p><p end="1081" is_meta="false" speaker="Mich&#232;le Flournoy" start="1022">grievance.</p><p end="1142" is_meta="false" speaker="Mich&#232;le Flournoy" start="1081">This will not be without risk. But I would argue, the risk of inaction are even greater. The</p><p end="1142" is_meta="false" speaker="Mich&#232;le Flournoy" start="1081">other team will argue that containment is a better option. I will tell you that</p><p end="1142" is_meta="false" speaker="Mich&#232;le Flournoy" start="1081">containment won't work. Containment means allowing ISIS to hold on to sanctuary. It</p><p end="1142" is_meta="false" speaker="Mich&#232;le Flournoy" start="1081">means ISIS will</p><p end="1142" is_meta="false" speaker="Mich&#232;le Flournoy" start="1081">be able to continue to plan attacks, recruit followers, inspire lone wolves.</p><p end="1142" is_meta="false" speaker="Mich&#232;le Flournoy" start="1081">Containment would be a recipe for endless terrorist attacks in the West and instability in</p><p end="1142" is_meta="false" speaker="Mich&#232;le Flournoy" start="1081">the Middle East. Is that a future we really want? It's not a future I want my children to</p><p end="1142" is_meta="false" speaker="Mich&#232;le Flournoy" start="1081">live in. If there's</p><p end="1142" is_meta="false" speaker="Mich&#232;le Flournoy" start="1081">anything we should have learned from 9/11, it is that we must not allow</p><p end="1142" is_meta="false" speaker="Mich&#232;le Flournoy" start="1081">a terrorist organization like this to have sanctuary in the heart of the Middle East or</p><p end="1142" is_meta="false" speaker="Mich&#232;le Flournoy" start="1081">elsewhere. Now is the time to do more, to act with our partners, to defeat ISIS. Thank</p><p end="1142" is_meta="false" speaker="Mich&#232;le Flournoy" start="1081">you.</p><p end="1142" is_meta="false" speaker="Mich&#232;le Flournoy" start="1081">John Donvan: Thank you, Mich&#232;le Flournoy.</p><p end="1142" is_meta="true" speaker="Mich&#232;le Flournoy" start="1081">applause</p><p end="1142" is_meta="false" speaker="Mich&#232;le Flournoy" start="1081">And the motion is: Containment is Not Enough: ISIS Must Be Defeated.</p><p end="1202" is_meta="false" speaker="Mich&#232;le Flournoy" start="1142">And our next debater will be speaking against that motion, Anne&#8208;Marie Slaughter. She is</p><p end="1202" is_meta="false" speaker="Mich&#232;le Flournoy" start="1142">president and CEO of New America and former director of policy planning for the U.S.</p><p end="1202" is_meta="false" speaker="Mich&#232;le Flournoy" start="1142">Department of</p><p end="1202" is_meta="false" speaker="Mich&#232;le Flournoy" start="1142">State. Ladies and gentlemen, Anne&#8208;Marie Slaughter.</p><p end="1202" is_meta="true" speaker="Mich&#232;le Flournoy" start="1142">applause</p><p end="1202" is_meta="false" speaker="Anne-Marie Slaughter" start="1142">So, I want to see the end of ISIS as much as anyone does. No one can watch the horrible</p><p end="1202" is_meta="false" speaker="Anne-Marie Slaughter" start="1142">things they do and not think that this is a terrible, terrible scourge and threat. And we</p><p end="1202" is_meta="false" speaker="Anne-Marie Slaughter" start="1142">have to</p><p end="1202" is_meta="false" speaker="Anne-Marie Slaughter" start="1142">end it. The question on the table is, "What is the best strategy to achieve that</p><p end="1202" is_meta="false" speaker="Anne-Marie Slaughter" start="1142">goal for the United States?" That's what we're debating. What is the best strategy for</p><p end="1202" is_meta="false" speaker="Anne-Marie Slaughter" start="1142">us? Now, our opponents are already fudging that question. Because the debate here is,</p><p end="1202" is_meta="false" speaker="Anne-Marie Slaughter" start="1142">do you use military force</p><p end="1202" is_meta="false" speaker="Anne-Marie Slaughter" start="1142">to drive them out of the territory they hold or do you contain</p><p end="1202" is_meta="false" speaker="Anne-Marie Slaughter" start="1142">them where they are?</p><p end="1264" is_meta="false" speaker="Anne-Marie Slaughter" start="1202">And so, what you're hearing is they can't have sanctuary. Mich&#232;le Flournoy said very</p><p end="1264" is_meta="false" speaker="Anne-Marie Slaughter" start="1202">clearly &#8208;&#8208; they cannot have a sanctuary. Okay? What they have to convince you of is they</p><p end="1264" is_meta="false" speaker="Anne-Marie Slaughter" start="1202">have a</p><p end="1264" is_meta="false" speaker="Anne-Marie Slaughter" start="1202">strategy for how the United States can deny them &#8208;&#8208; can deny ISIS &#8208;&#8208; that</p><p end="1264" is_meta="false" speaker="Anne-Marie Slaughter" start="1202">strategy. So, let's just be very clear about what's on the table here. They have to</p><p end="1264" is_meta="false" speaker="Anne-Marie Slaughter" start="1202">convince you they have a strategy for the United States to drive ISIS out of that</p><p end="1264" is_meta="false" speaker="Anne-Marie Slaughter" start="1202">sanctuary, and somehow magically, without boots</p><p end="1264" is_meta="false" speaker="Anne-Marie Slaughter" start="1202">on the ground. But I'll leave that to</p><p end="1264" is_meta="false" speaker="Anne-Marie Slaughter" start="1202">them. So, they have to tell you what defeat is and how the U.S. can achieve it. Here's</p><p end="1264" is_meta="false" speaker="Anne-Marie Slaughter" start="1202">what we mean by containment. We mean stopping ISIS where it is. We mean critically</p><p end="1264" is_meta="false" speaker="Anne-Marie Slaughter" start="1202">breaking their narrative of victory. We all heard from</p><p end="1264" is_meta="false" speaker="Anne-Marie Slaughter" start="1202">Professor Haykel, who Bob</p><p end="1264" is_meta="false" speaker="Anne-Marie Slaughter" start="1202">Rosenkranz mentioned. He said, "Look, what is essential is that every time ISIS wins,</p><p end="1264" is_meta="false" speaker="Anne-Marie Slaughter" start="1202">they convince their supporters God is on their side."</p><p end="1318" is_meta="false" speaker="Anne-Marie Slaughter" start="1264">All right. It is a kind of end&#8208;of&#8208;days, millenarian &#8208;&#8208; "This is it. We're going to restore the</p><p end="1318" is_meta="false" speaker="Anne-Marie Slaughter" start="1264">caliphate. We're going to</p><p end="1318" is_meta="false" speaker="Anne-Marie Slaughter" start="1264">spread it across the world. And see, God is on our side because</p><p end="1318" is_meta="false" speaker="Anne-Marie Slaughter" start="1264">we have just taken another city." So, containment says you break that. You do not let</p><p end="1318" is_meta="false" speaker="Anne-Marie Slaughter" start="1264">them expand their territory and you do everything you can to stop the flow of recruits.</p><p end="1318" is_meta="false" speaker="Anne-Marie Slaughter" start="1264">So you stop them where</p><p end="1318" is_meta="false" speaker="Anne-Marie Slaughter" start="1264">they are. So, that's containment. It's not a do&#8208;nothing strategy. In fact, it's doing everything possible, and certainly, diplomatically everything possible.</p><p end="1318" is_meta="false" speaker="Anne-Marie Slaughter" start="1264">Digitally everything possible. In &#8208;&#8208; and militarily, stopping them from expanding where</p><p end="1318" is_meta="false" speaker="Anne-Marie Slaughter" start="1264">they are. It may also mean supporting our allies and friends in the Middle East to the</p><p end="1318" is_meta="false" speaker="Anne-Marie Slaughter" start="1264">extent they take the lead in wanting to push ISIS back.</p><p end="1318" is_meta="false" speaker="Anne-Marie Slaughter" start="1264">So that's containment. We're</p><p end="1318" is_meta="false" speaker="Anne-Marie Slaughter" start="1264">going to stop them where they are.</p><p end="1382" is_meta="false" speaker="Anne-Marie Slaughter" start="1318">We're going to let their internal contradictions show themselves. We're going to let</p><p end="1382" is_meta="false" speaker="Anne-Marie Slaughter" start="1318">ultimately, as we have done before, for the older members of this audience &#8208;&#8208; we're</p><p end="1382" is_meta="false" speaker="Anne-Marie Slaughter" start="1318">going to let the ideology crumble itself. The alternative is roll&#8208;back.</p><p end="1382" is_meta="false" speaker="Anne-Marie Slaughter" start="1318">Right? The</p><p end="1382" is_meta="false" speaker="Anne-Marie Slaughter" start="1318">alternative, as I said, is going in there and actually pushing them out of that territory.</p><p end="1382" is_meta="false" speaker="Anne-Marie Slaughter" start="1318">And I'm going to leave it to my partner, Dov Zakheim &#8208;&#8208;</p><p end="1382" is_meta="true" speaker="Anne-Marie Slaughter" start="1318">laughter</p><p end="1382" is_meta="false" speaker="Anne-Marie Slaughter" start="1318">&#8208;&#8208; the brilliant Dov Zakheim. He's going to talk about why that's so hard militarily. But</p><p end="1382" is_meta="false" speaker="Anne-Marie Slaughter" start="1318">what I want to do</p><p end="1382" is_meta="false" speaker="Anne-Marie Slaughter" start="1318">is talk about why that won't work, why roll&#8208;back won't work</p><p end="1382" is_meta="false" speaker="Anne-Marie Slaughter" start="1318">politically. And the first thing to say is we've seen this movie before. General Petraeus</p><p end="1382" is_meta="false" speaker="Anne-Marie Slaughter" start="1318">was on the stage two days ago, talking about how he had pushed Al&#8208;Qaeda in Iraq out of</p><p end="1382" is_meta="false" speaker="Anne-Marie Slaughter" start="1318">Mosul. Al&#8208;Qaeda in</p><p end="1382" is_meta="false" speaker="Anne-Marie Slaughter" start="1318">Iraq is not there, but guess who's back in Mosul? ISIS is there. This is</p><p end="1382" is_meta="false" speaker="Anne-Marie Slaughter" start="1318">Round 2. We have done this militarily before. That didn't work. And here's why, because</p><p end="1382" is_meta="false" speaker="Anne-Marie Slaughter" start="1318">it isn't just an idea.</p><p end="1441" is_meta="false" speaker="Anne-Marie Slaughter" start="1382">It is not just a military question. ISIS is an ideology. Professor Haykel said</p><p end="1441" is_meta="false" speaker="Anne-Marie Slaughter" start="1382">on the same</p><p end="1441" is_meta="false" speaker="Anne-Marie Slaughter" start="1382">stage that, of course, defeat is desirable. But how do you defeat a set of ideas? So, the</p><p end="1441" is_meta="false" speaker="Anne-Marie Slaughter" start="1382">way we've done this before, when we were up against an ideology &#8208;&#8208; for most of my life,</p><p end="1441" is_meta="false" speaker="Anne-Marie Slaughter" start="1382">that ideology was Communism. Containment was the most successful strategy the</p><p end="1441" is_meta="false" speaker="Anne-Marie Slaughter" start="1382">United States</p><p end="1441" is_meta="false" speaker="Anne-Marie Slaughter" start="1382">has ever pursued. And it didn't mean not doing anything. And we had to</p><p end="1441" is_meta="false" speaker="Anne-Marie Slaughter" start="1382">use our military. And we used our &#8208;&#8208; diplomatically. But we contained the Soviet Union</p><p end="1441" is_meta="false" speaker="Anne-Marie Slaughter" start="1382">and ultimately, we let its internal contradictions destroy it. So, it's happened before.</p><p end="1441" is_meta="false" speaker="Anne-Marie Slaughter" start="1382">And it'll come again. Equally &#8208;&#8208; or more troubling is</p><p end="1441" is_meta="false" speaker="Anne-Marie Slaughter" start="1382">that if we inject ourselves, we</p><p end="1441" is_meta="false" speaker="Anne-Marie Slaughter" start="1382">confirm their narrative. Right? ISIS's narrative is that they are fighting the crusaders &#8208;&#8208;</p><p end="1441" is_meta="false" speaker="Anne-Marie Slaughter" start="1382">that's us &#8208;&#8208; the Zionists &#8208;&#8208; that's the Israelis &#8208;&#8208; and the Shiites and the Sufis.</p><p end="1504" is_meta="false" speaker="Anne-Marie Slaughter" start="1441">So, the minute we put ourselves in there, we are confirming to them and everyone they</p><p end="1504" is_meta="false" speaker="Anne-Marie Slaughter" start="1441">want to</p><p end="1504" is_meta="false" speaker="Anne-Marie Slaughter" start="1441">recruit that this is indeed the millennial battle between the crusaders and the</p><p end="1504" is_meta="false" speaker="Anne-Marie Slaughter" start="1441">true defenders of Islam. We don't want to do that. The last reason that we need to</p><p end="1504" is_meta="false" speaker="Anne-Marie Slaughter" start="1441">pursue a containment strategy is this is a very long game. So, General Petraeus said two</p><p end="1504" is_meta="false" speaker="Anne-Marie Slaughter" start="1441">days ago &#8208;&#8208; and he</p><p end="1504" is_meta="false" speaker="Anne-Marie Slaughter" start="1441">was quoting General Odierno &#8208;&#8208; that this was a fight at least of a decade, if not a decade or two decades. So, 10 to 20 years. That's what are our generals</p><p end="1504" is_meta="false" speaker="Anne-Marie Slaughter" start="1441">are telling us now. That actually, I think, could be on the short side. So, remember your</p><p end="1504" is_meta="false" speaker="Anne-Marie Slaughter" start="1441">history and remember stories of monotheistic faith in which clerics had both political</p><p end="1504" is_meta="false" speaker="Anne-Marie Slaughter" start="1441">and religious</p><p end="1504" is_meta="false" speaker="Anne-Marie Slaughter" start="1441">power and were deeply, deeply corrupt and spawned a revolt that said you</p><p end="1504" is_meta="false" speaker="Anne-Marie Slaughter" start="1441">had to purify the church and ultimately that was the only way to reclaim the true</p><p end="1504" is_meta="false" speaker="Anne-Marie Slaughter" start="1441">religion.</p><p end="1558" is_meta="false" speaker="Anne-Marie Slaughter" start="1504">Obviously that's the Reformation.  It was just decades, it was centuries.  This is a deeply</p><p end="1558" is_meta="false" speaker="Anne-Marie Slaughter" start="1504">internal Muslim fight.  It is</p><p end="1558" is_meta="false" speaker="Anne-Marie Slaughter" start="1504">a fight for the soul of Islam.  It is not our fight.  It is the</p><p end="1558" is_meta="false" speaker="Anne-Marie Slaughter" start="1504">Muslim's fight.  In the end we have to protect ourselves.  We have to contain it, but we</p><p end="1558" is_meta="false" speaker="Anne-Marie Slaughter" start="1504">cannot win it.</p><p end="1558" is_meta="false" speaker="Anne-Marie Slaughter" start="1504">Thank</p><p end="1558" is_meta="false" speaker="Anne-Marie Slaughter" start="1504">you.</p><p end="1558" is_meta="true" speaker="Anne-Marie Slaughter" start="1504">applause</p><p end="1623" is_meta="false" speaker="Philip Zelikow" start="1558">Tough issue, but I want to start where Anne&#8208;Marie Slaughter left off.  She said injecting</p><p end="1623" is_meta="false" speaker="Philip Zelikow" start="1558">the United States into this conflict confirms their narrative.  As if we're not injected</p><p end="1623" is_meta="false" speaker="Philip Zelikow" start="1558">already?  As if we're not conducting air strikes against them every single day?  As</p><p end="1623" is_meta="false" speaker="Philip Zelikow" start="1558">if</p><p end="1623" is_meta="false" speaker="Philip Zelikow" start="1558">we're not, as the Deputy Secretary of State has said, "We've already killed 10,000 of</p><p end="1623" is_meta="false" speaker="Philip Zelikow" start="1558">their members, but it has not declined."  In other words, we're already injected.  We're</p><p end="1623" is_meta="false" speaker="Philip Zelikow" start="1558">already fighting, we're just not beating them.  That confirms their narrative.  That</p><p end="1623" is_meta="false" speaker="Philip Zelikow" start="1558">confirms their narrative of victory.  Their crusaders attack us</p><p end="1623" is_meta="false" speaker="Philip Zelikow" start="1558">every day.  That's the way they put it.  And here we are controlling 20 cities, ruling millions of people, and</p><p end="1623" is_meta="false" speaker="Philip Zelikow" start="1558">enslaving more.  Let's talk about what failure looks like.  Sure, failure looks like hundreds</p><p end="1623" is_meta="false" speaker="Philip Zelikow" start="1558">or thousands of Americans dead after an attack that could come next month, next year,</p><p end="1623" is_meta="false" speaker="Philip Zelikow" start="1558">or the year after that.</p><p end="1678" is_meta="false" speaker="Philip Zelikow" start="1623">The 9/11 attack that I studied gestated for three years before they laid waste to</p><p end="1678" is_meta="false" speaker="Philip Zelikow" start="1623">southern Manhattan.  The people who carried out that attack migrated from Germany</p><p end="1678" is_meta="false" speaker="Philip Zelikow" start="1623">to Afghanistan nearly two years before the attack.  They went there, by the way,</p><p end="1678" is_meta="false" speaker="Philip Zelikow" start="1623">thinking that they were going to go fight Russians</p><p end="1678" is_meta="false" speaker="Philip Zelikow" start="1623">in Chechnya, but the leadership found</p><p end="1678" is_meta="false" speaker="Philip Zelikow" start="1623">other uses for them.  So failure looks like hundreds or thousands of Americans dead</p><p end="1678" is_meta="false" speaker="Philip Zelikow" start="1623">with more violence in Europe, but failure also looks like the descent of the Middle East</p><p end="1678" is_meta="false" speaker="Philip Zelikow" start="1623">into the full war of extremes in which its all against all, in which its</p><p end="1678" is_meta="false" speaker="Philip Zelikow" start="1623">Shia extremists</p><p end="1678" is_meta="false" speaker="Philip Zelikow" start="1623">supported by Iran and Sunni extremists for whom ISIS is the terrifying sort of purity and</p><p end="1678" is_meta="false" speaker="Philip Zelikow" start="1623">Lebanon crumples and Jordan crumples and Turkey begins to crumple, all already awash</p><p end="1678" is_meta="false" speaker="Philip Zelikow" start="1623">with millions of displaced people.</p><p end="1745" is_meta="false" speaker="Philip Zelikow" start="1678">All are already failing to cope.  Their societies already sagging under the weight</p><p end="1745" is_meta="false" speaker="Philip Zelikow" start="1678">of the</p><p end="1745" is_meta="false" speaker="Philip Zelikow" start="1678">burdens.  Saudi Arabia destabilized as more and more Sunnis find that that's really the</p><p end="1745" is_meta="false" speaker="Philip Zelikow" start="1678">extreme version of their own ideology that they want to follow.  Don't you think that</p><p end="1745" is_meta="false" speaker="Philip Zelikow" start="1678">that's the point that the U.S. has to reinvade the Middle East?  That's failure.  U.S.</p><p end="1745" is_meta="false" speaker="Philip Zelikow" start="1678">reinvasion of the Middle</p><p end="1745" is_meta="false" speaker="Philip Zelikow" start="1678">East is failure.  That's the failure Mich&#232;le Flournoy and I are</p><p end="1745" is_meta="false" speaker="Philip Zelikow" start="1678">against.  That's why you need to adopt this resolution and defeat ISIS so that we don&#8217;t</p><p end="1745" is_meta="false" speaker="Philip Zelikow" start="1678">have to reinvade the Middle East.  What then does success look like?  Success looks like</p><p end="1745" is_meta="false" speaker="Philip Zelikow" start="1678">defeating their message.  What's their message?  It's a message</p><p end="1745" is_meta="false" speaker="Philip Zelikow" start="1678">about power.  We</p><p end="1745" is_meta="false" speaker="Philip Zelikow" start="1678">empower the weak Sunni Muslims and we empower them through the exclusive divine</p><p end="1745" is_meta="false" speaker="Philip Zelikow" start="1678">mission they hold and the terrifying sword they wield in the territory we rule, ruling</p><p end="1745" is_meta="false" speaker="Philip Zelikow" start="1678">despite the crusader's attacks against us.  So what does success look like?  It's Sunni</p><p end="1745" is_meta="false" speaker="Philip Zelikow" start="1678">Muslims liberating their own lands.</p><p end="1807" is_meta="false" speaker="Philip Zelikow" start="1745">It's Sunni Muslims recovering self&#8208;determination.  So what's the strategy to do that?  It's</p><p end="1807" is_meta="false" speaker="Philip Zelikow" start="1745">a political strategy first and foremost, because the public debate in America is mostly</p><p end="1807" is_meta="false" speaker="Philip Zelikow" start="1745">about should we do more militarily.  That's wrong.  Mich&#232;le and I both believe, know the</p><p end="1807" is_meta="false" speaker="Philip Zelikow" start="1745">strategy leads politically and it needs</p><p end="1807" is_meta="false" speaker="Philip Zelikow" start="1745">to be a strategy that appeals to Sunni Muslims,</p><p end="1807" is_meta="false" speaker="Philip Zelikow" start="1745">because they're the ones we want to do most of the fighting to keep Americans from</p><p end="1807" is_meta="false" speaker="Philip Zelikow" start="1745">having to do most of the fighting later on.  Why will they fight?  They will fight to free</p><p end="1807" is_meta="false" speaker="Philip Zelikow" start="1745">themselves, to free themselves from the Assad tyranny</p><p end="1807" is_meta="false" speaker="Philip Zelikow" start="1745">in Syria where we also must join</p><p end="1807" is_meta="false" speaker="Philip Zelikow" start="1745">that fight and end the Syrian Civil War, which is destroying the region and bringing it</p><p end="1807" is_meta="false" speaker="Philip Zelikow" start="1745">close to the brink of apocalypse.  That's the kind of message that appeals to Turkey and brings them in on our side and units Saudi Arabia and the Sunnis of Lebanon and the</p><p end="1807" is_meta="false" speaker="Philip Zelikow" start="1745">millions of Syrians in refugee camps who want to return to their homes.</p><p end="1853" is_meta="false" speaker="Philip Zelikow" start="1807">Because, you see, ISIS is not homegrown.  ISIS are foreigners.  The ISIS rulers in Syria are</p><p end="1853" is_meta="false" speaker="Philip Zelikow" start="1807">led by Iraqis</p><p end="1853" is_meta="false" speaker="Philip Zelikow" start="1807">and veterans of Saddam Hussein's gestapo and they recruit Uzbeks and</p><p end="1853" is_meta="false" speaker="Philip Zelikow" start="1807">Chechens to run their shock troops in Mosul.  Many of the Iraqi recruits that they</p><p end="1853" is_meta="false" speaker="Philip Zelikow" start="1807">enslave into their service don't even understand the command language that they're</p><p end="1853" is_meta="false" speaker="Philip Zelikow" start="1807">hearing on the radio.  So the political strategy is a self&#8208;determination</p><p end="1853" is_meta="false" speaker="Philip Zelikow" start="1807">of Sunni</p><p end="1853" is_meta="false" speaker="Philip Zelikow" start="1807">Muslims.  And the military strategy, advise and support so they can do the job, but it's a</p><p end="1853" is_meta="false" speaker="Philip Zelikow" start="1807">tough job.  They have to retake cities.  To do that kind of urban warfare requires just the</p><p end="1853" is_meta="false" speaker="Philip Zelikow" start="1807">kind of assets that only the United States has.</p><p end="1920" is_meta="false" speaker="Philip Zelikow" start="1853">Think about urban combat and</p><p end="1920" is_meta="false" speaker="Philip Zelikow" start="1853">what you need, armored vehicles that aren't going to be</p><p end="1920" is_meta="false" speaker="Philip Zelikow" start="1853">blown up by an IED as easily, jammers to diffuse the IEDs, snipers who can provide over</p><p end="1920" is_meta="false" speaker="Philip Zelikow" start="1853">watch, communication so that you know what's going on in the block two blocks away</p><p end="1920" is_meta="false" speaker="Philip Zelikow" start="1853">from you, medivac capabilities that give you the</p><p end="1920" is_meta="false" speaker="Philip Zelikow" start="1853">confidence your wounded can be</p><p end="1920" is_meta="false" speaker="Philip Zelikow" start="1853">treated and helicopters and fires that can be brought to bear on the targets you see in</p><p end="1920" is_meta="false" speaker="Philip Zelikow" start="1853">front of you.  Those are assets only the United States can provide, which gives them the</p><p end="1920" is_meta="false" speaker="Philip Zelikow" start="1853">confidence and the sense that we're in this with them that allows you</p><p end="1920" is_meta="false" speaker="Philip Zelikow" start="1853">to build a</p><p end="1920" is_meta="false" speaker="Philip Zelikow" start="1853">coalition founded on Sunni Muslims doing the job to liberate their own lands, because</p><p end="1920" is_meta="false" speaker="Philip Zelikow" start="1853">containment doesn't keep the U.S. out.  It guarantees the U.S. is likely to come</p><p end="1920" is_meta="false" speaker="Philip Zelikow" start="1853">in.  Anne&#8208;Marie said it at last.  Let ideology crumble itself.  Did the Khmer Rouge</p><p end="1920" is_meta="false" speaker="Philip Zelikow" start="1853">crumble itself?  No, the</p><p end="1920" is_meta="false" speaker="Philip Zelikow" start="1853">Vietnamese had to invade Cambodia.  Did the Taliban crumble</p><p end="1920" is_meta="false" speaker="Philip Zelikow" start="1853">itself?  Did al&#8208;Qaeda in Pakistan crumble itself?  Has the North Korean tyranny crumbled</p><p end="1920" is_meta="false" speaker="Philip Zelikow" start="1853">itself?</p><p end="1984" is_meta="false" speaker="Philip Zelikow" start="1920">No.  You have to beat terror with something else and in this case the something else is</p><p end="1984" is_meta="false" speaker="Philip Zelikow" start="1920">defeating terror where it has taken root in</p><p end="1984" is_meta="false" speaker="Philip Zelikow" start="1920">ISIS.  Support the resolution.</p><p end="1984" is_meta="false" speaker="Dov Zakheim" start="1920">Thanks very much and I really want to thank Phil, because he just made my</p><p end="1984" is_meta="false" speaker="Dov Zakheim" start="1920">argument.  We have armed ISIS.  What do you think they're using?  American personnel</p><p end="1984" is_meta="false" speaker="Dov Zakheim" start="1920">carriers.  American tanks.  American ammunition.  Why?</p><p end="1984" is_meta="false" speaker="Dov Zakheim" start="1920">Because we've done such a</p><p end="1984" is_meta="false" speaker="Dov Zakheim" start="1920">fantastic job training the Iraqis and we've been doing it for over a decade, and we've</p><p end="1984" is_meta="false" speaker="Dov Zakheim" start="1920">done an equally good job training the Afghans.</p><p end="2046" is_meta="false" speaker="Dov Zakheim" start="1984">That's why they're doing so well.  And in fact, if you look at who we've trained in Syria,</p><p end="2046" is_meta="false" speaker="Dov Zakheim" start="1984">we have</p><p end="2046" is_meta="false" speaker="Dov Zakheim" start="1984">a $500 million program that thus far has spat out 60 fighters, 60.  That's less</p><p end="2046" is_meta="false" speaker="Dov Zakheim" start="1984">than that side of the room.  Of which, and I hope this doesn't happen to any of you all, a</p><p end="2046" is_meta="false" speaker="Dov Zakheim" start="1984">whole bunch have already been captured.  So let's step back and look at what it</p><p end="2046" is_meta="false" speaker="Dov Zakheim" start="1984">really</p><p end="2046" is_meta="false" speaker="Dov Zakheim" start="1984">takes to beat these folks and to do something other than to contain them the way my</p><p end="2046" is_meta="false" speaker="Dov Zakheim" start="1984">brilliant colleague, Anne&#8208;Marie Slaughter &#8208;&#8208;</p><p end="2046" is_meta="true" speaker="Dov Zakheim" start="1984">laughter</p><p end="2046" is_meta="false" speaker="Dov Zakheim" start="1984">&#8208;&#8208; laid out for you.  You know, this isn't the first outburst of Islamic extremism.  For</p><p end="2046" is_meta="false" speaker="Dov Zakheim" start="1984">instance, in the 12th Century there was a fanatical group that</p><p end="2046" is_meta="false" speaker="Dov Zakheim" start="1984">actually had the same</p><p end="2046" is_meta="false" speaker="Dov Zakheim" start="1984">ideology as these guys called the Almohads.</p><p end="2102" is_meta="false" speaker="Dov Zakheim" start="2046">And how were they defeated?  By massive forces of Christian troops coming down from</p><p end="2102" is_meta="false" speaker="Dov Zakheim" start="2046">northern Spain.  In the 18th Century, the original Wahhabis who had made a deal with</p><p end="2102" is_meta="false" speaker="Dov Zakheim" start="2046">the first [unintelligible], basically same kind of ideology.  They were</p><p end="2102" is_meta="false" speaker="Dov Zakheim" start="2046">defeated by Turkish</p><p end="2102" is_meta="false" speaker="Dov Zakheim" start="2046">forces, and then we had the same sort of thing again in the late 19th Century when Lord</p><p end="2102" is_meta="false" speaker="Dov Zakheim" start="2046">Kitchener, then General Kitchener, amassed a huge force to defeat the Mahdi in Sudan.</p><p end="2102" is_meta="false" speaker="Dov Zakheim" start="2046">What's the common denominator? Lots of troops. Not a few thousand. Not a bunch of</p><p end="2102" is_meta="false" speaker="Dov Zakheim" start="2046">spotters, because oh, by the way, when the Israelis couldn't beat Hezbollah in 2006,</p><p end="2102" is_meta="false" speaker="Dov Zakheim" start="2046">they didn't have a problem with spotters.</p><p end="2163" is_meta="false" speaker="Dov Zakheim" start="2102">And when we tried to bomb Vietnam to the Stone Age in the 1960s, with Rolling</p><p end="2163" is_meta="false" speaker="Dov Zakheim" start="2102">Thunder, we didn't have a problem with spotters. Spotters aren't the issue.</p><p end="2163" is_meta="false" speaker="Dov Zakheim" start="2102">The issue is,</p><p end="2163" is_meta="false" speaker="Dov Zakheim" start="2102">can you and are you willing to send in hundreds of thousands of troops? Do you think</p><p end="2163" is_meta="false" speaker="Dov Zakheim" start="2102">this country wants to do that? Do you think we even want to spend the money to do that? We're living under a strange thing called a sequester. Somebody was asked on</p><p end="2163" is_meta="false" speaker="Dov Zakheim" start="2102">television, "What's a sequester?" And he answered, "It's the capital of Portugal."</p><p end="2163" is_meta="true" speaker="Dov Zakheim" start="2102">laughter</p><p end="2163" is_meta="false" speaker="Dov Zakheim" start="2102">People don't even know what a sequester is. But what it's done is limit our spending.</p><p end="2163" is_meta="false" speaker="Dov Zakheim" start="2102">And you talk to Secretary of Defense</p><p end="2163" is_meta="false" speaker="Dov Zakheim" start="2102">Carter and he rightly says he's being constrained all</p><p end="2163" is_meta="false" speaker="Dov Zakheim" start="2102">over the place.

Do we have the staying power for that kind of thing?</p><p end="2220" is_meta="false" speaker="Dov Zakheim" start="2163">The only way you're going</p><p end="2220" is_meta="false" speaker="Dov Zakheim" start="2163">to stop these guys is if, indeed, they rot from within. That's the only alternative if you're</p><p end="2220" is_meta="false" speaker="Dov Zakheim" start="2163">not going to send hundreds of thousands of troops in. And to get them to rot from</p><p end="2220" is_meta="false" speaker="Dov Zakheim" start="2163">within, you have to contain them. You've got to keep them cooped</p><p end="2220" is_meta="false" speaker="Dov Zakheim" start="2163">up. And there are</p><p end="2220" is_meta="false" speaker="Dov Zakheim" start="2163">ways to do that. But we're not even in one mind as to how to right now. Yes, we love</p><p end="2220" is_meta="false" speaker="Dov Zakheim" start="2163">the Kurds, but we don't arm them. Yes, we want to work with the Turks, except the</p><p end="2220" is_meta="false" speaker="Dov Zakheim" start="2163">Turks have a different agenda. They want to bomb</p><p end="2220" is_meta="false" speaker="Dov Zakheim" start="2163">the Kurds, who we like.</p><p end="2220" is_meta="true" speaker="Dov Zakheim" start="2163">laughter</p><p end="2220" is_meta="false" speaker="Dov Zakheim" start="2163">I mean, you need a scorecard to figure out who exactly is on your side.</p><p end="2284" is_meta="false" speaker="Dov Zakheim" start="2220">How do you beat these people that way? The bottom line is &#8208;&#8208; unless we have a</p><p end="2284" is_meta="false" speaker="Dov Zakheim" start="2220">coherent major military strategy, the real alternative &#8208;&#8208; when you parse out all</p><p end="2284" is_meta="false" speaker="Dov Zakheim" start="2220">the stuff</p><p end="2284" is_meta="false" speaker="Dov Zakheim" start="2220">about what we can do right now, the real alternative is to keep them cooped up, to arm</p><p end="2284" is_meta="false" speaker="Dov Zakheim" start="2220">our friends, to figure out how to train those who will fight. And yes, the Sunnis might</p><p end="2284" is_meta="false" speaker="Dov Zakheim" start="2220">fight. But guess what? They haven't fought until now. We've been begging them for</p><p end="2284" is_meta="false" speaker="Dov Zakheim" start="2220">years. Saudi Arabia is fighting, except not in Syria, not in Iraq. They're fighting in Yemen.</p><p end="2284" is_meta="false" speaker="Dov Zakheim" start="2220">And they're not doing that hot a job there either. So, we have to figure out how to</p><p end="2284" is_meta="false" speaker="Dov Zakheim" start="2220">motivate those we want to work with us. And that's going to take time. And what</p><p end="2284" is_meta="false" speaker="Dov Zakheim" start="2220">do we</p><p end="2284" is_meta="false" speaker="Dov Zakheim" start="2220">do in the meantime?

You have to take territory away from</p><p end="2468" is_meta="false" speaker="Mich&#232;le Flournoy" start="2403">ISIS. And the way in which we're arguing to do that is to look to the actors who do have</p><p end="2468" is_meta="false" speaker="Mich&#232;le Flournoy" start="2403">the political will to fight, but have not been given the support or conditions.</p><p end="2523" is_meta="false" speaker="Mich&#232;le Flournoy" start="2468">So, for example, this</p><p end="2523" is_meta="false" speaker="Mich&#232;le Flournoy" start="2468">is not about trying to retrain a largely Shi'a Iraqi security forces to</p><p end="2523" is_meta="false" speaker="Mich&#232;le Flournoy" start="2468">go into Sunni areas. What we need to do is, first, with a political strategy, push the Iraqi</p><p end="2523" is_meta="false" speaker="Mich&#232;le Flournoy" start="2468">government towards a policy of inclusion of the Sunnis. If the exclusion and the</p><p end="2523" is_meta="false" speaker="Mich&#232;le Flournoy" start="2468">persecution of the Sunni populations &#8208;&#8208; that</p><p end="2523" is_meta="false" speaker="Mich&#232;le Flournoy" start="2468">has created the fertile soil for a group like</p><p end="2523" is_meta="false" speaker="Mich&#232;le Flournoy" start="2468">ISIS to come in. They are willing to fight because it's their home territories.</p><p end="2523" is_meta="false" speaker="Mich&#232;le Flournoy" start="2468">But they need two conditions.

And number</p><p end="2523" is_meta="false" speaker="Mich&#232;le Flournoy" start="2468">two, they have to know that they're fully supported, that we have their back, that</p><p end="2523" is_meta="false" speaker="Mich&#232;le Flournoy" start="2468">someone has their back.</p><p end="2580" is_meta="false" speaker="Mich&#232;le Flournoy" start="2523">And here, it's not a matter of</p><p end="2580" is_meta="false" speaker="Mich&#232;le Flournoy" start="2523">U.S., you know, brigades and divisions. It's a matter of</p><p end="2580" is_meta="false" speaker="Mich&#232;le Flournoy" start="2523">giving them not only trainers on a base, but combat advisers who will help advise them</p><p end="2580" is_meta="false" speaker="Mich&#232;le Flournoy" start="2523">when they're in contact with ISIS.</p><p end="2580" is_meta="false" speaker="Dov Zakheim" start="2523">Yeah. A couple of things on that. First, we've been promising this to the Sunnis for a long</p><p end="2580" is_meta="false" speaker="Dov Zakheim" start="2523">time in Iraq. Why should they believe us? Number one. We haven't done it until now.</p><p end="2580" is_meta="false" speaker="Dov Zakheim" start="2523">And who knows if we can do it?</p><p end="2580" is_meta="false" speaker="Dov Zakheim" start="2523">Phillip Zelikow: Dov, that's not true.

What you did in '07</p><p end="2639" is_meta="false" speaker="Dov Zakheim" start="2580">and '08 was absolutely right. What has happened since then? And by the way, let's look</p><p end="2639" is_meta="false" speaker="Dov Zakheim" start="2580">at Syria. Who did the Syrians want to fight first? ISIS or Assad?</p><p end="2639" is_meta="false" speaker="Dov Zakheim" start="2580">Absolutely.</p><p end="2639" is_meta="true" speaker="Dov Zakheim" start="2580">laughter</p><p end="2639" is_meta="false" speaker="Dov Zakheim" start="2580">The point is that if you're talking about bucking up people to fight against ISIS, you don't</p><p end="2639" is_meta="false" speaker="Dov Zakheim" start="2580">have the people to buck up because we don't have the credibility to buck them up.</p><p end="2639" is_meta="false" speaker="Dov Zakheim" start="2580">Does</p><p end="2639" is_meta="false" speaker="Dov Zakheim" start="2580">that come to the point?</p><p end="2639" is_meta="false" speaker="Dov Zakheim" start="2580">Can't happen.</p><p end="2639" is_meta="false" speaker="Anne-Marie Slaughter" start="2580">I would &#8208;&#8208;</p><p end="2639" is_meta="false" speaker="Philip Zelikow" start="2580">We're not saying the status quo works.

So, that promises the Sunnis the self&#8208;government. Yes, many</p><p end="2705" is_meta="false" speaker="Philip Zelikow" start="2639">of them feel betrayed. They feel betrayed because the U.S. did not have their back after</p><p end="2705" is_meta="false" speaker="Philip Zelikow" start="2639">2008, for various reasons. And so, you have to give them a situation in which they are</p><p end="2705" is_meta="false" speaker="Philip Zelikow" start="2639">the dominant population in Syria. That's majority</p><p end="2705" is_meta="false" speaker="Philip Zelikow" start="2639">rule in Syria. And then in Iraq,</p><p end="2705" is_meta="false" speaker="Philip Zelikow" start="2639">therefore, a protected minority, up in the north and in the south. And that's doable.</p><p end="2705" is_meta="false" speaker="Philip Zelikow" start="2639">In fact, the Iraqi prime minister, for the first time, with the council of ministers, has</p><p end="2705" is_meta="false" speaker="Philip Zelikow" start="2639">moved forward, with U.S. pressure, and the laws that would actually put in place the</p><p end="2705" is_meta="false" speaker="Philip Zelikow" start="2639">devolution of power down to the provinces to an unprecedented level combined with a</p><p end="2705" is_meta="false" speaker="Philip Zelikow" start="2639">constitution that would give those</p><p end="2705" is_meta="false" speaker="Philip Zelikow" start="2639">provinces the money proportionately to their</p><p end="2705" is_meta="false" speaker="Philip Zelikow" start="2639">population out of the Iraqi budget.  Combine that with the kind of military support</p><p end="2705" is_meta="false" speaker="Philip Zelikow" start="2639">Mich&#232;le refers to and then you have a strategy that's realistic.  But think about the</p><p end="2705" is_meta="false" speaker="Philip Zelikow" start="2639">alternative.</p><p end="2705" is_meta="false" speaker="Philip Zelikow" start="2639">Do you give up on them and let</p><p end="2705" is_meta="false" speaker="Philip Zelikow" start="2639">it go?</p><p end="2760" is_meta="false" speaker="Anne-Marie Slaughter" start="2705">Phil, I feel like I'm back in 1965, although I was very young in 1965, but I really &#8208;&#8208; I feel</p><p end="2760" is_meta="false" speaker="Anne-Marie Slaughter" start="2705">like you're saying I'm sure we can find these folks and I'm sure they can fight our fight</p><p end="2760" is_meta="false" speaker="Anne-Marie Slaughter" start="2705">just</p><p end="2760" is_meta="false" speaker="Anne-Marie Slaughter" start="2705">as long as we give them what they need to do.  And if they don't, well, we'll give</p><p end="2760" is_meta="false" speaker="Anne-Marie Slaughter" start="2705">them a little more and then we'll give them some advisors on the ground.  And then</p><p end="2760" is_meta="false" speaker="Anne-Marie Slaughter" start="2705">guess what, because we really got to get this done because we really do have to roll</p><p end="2760" is_meta="false" speaker="Anne-Marie Slaughter" start="2705">it</p><p end="2760" is_meta="false" speaker="Anne-Marie Slaughter" start="2705">back, we're going to send in the troops.  It's not as if the Obama administration is not</p><p end="2760" is_meta="false" speaker="Anne-Marie Slaughter" start="2705">pushing as hard as it can on the Iraqis to be inclusive.  That has been our</p><p end="2760" is_meta="false" speaker="Anne-Marie Slaughter" start="2705">strategy.  They're working as hard as they can.</p><p end="2760" is_meta="false" speaker="Anne-Marie Slaughter" start="2705">It's not as if they're not trying to</p><p end="2760" is_meta="false" speaker="Anne-Marie Slaughter" start="2705">find people in Syria who will fight ISIL.  It's not as if they</p><p end="2760" is_meta="false" speaker="Anne-Marie Slaughter" start="2705">haven't been pushing Turkey to fight ISIL.  Everybody wants to fight ISIL, but they want</p><p end="2760" is_meta="false" speaker="Anne-Marie Slaughter" start="2705">to fight someone else more and we can't do it for them.  Tom Friedman said, "Any</p><p end="2760" is_meta="false" speaker="Anne-Marie Slaughter" start="2705">strategy in the Middle East that starts</p><p end="2760" is_meta="false" speaker="Anne-Marie Slaughter" start="2705">with I, we, or us, is doomed to fail."</p><p end="2825" is_meta="false" speaker="Anne-Marie Slaughter" start="2760">It's got to be a strategy that starts with them, they lead, we stop &#8208;&#8208; we don't let ISIS</p><p end="2825" is_meta="false" speaker="Anne-Marie Slaughter" start="2760">expand, but they have to do the fighting and we can back them if they want to, but</p><p end="2825" is_meta="false" speaker="Anne-Marie Slaughter" start="2760">we're not going to</p><p end="2825" is_meta="false" speaker="Anne-Marie Slaughter" start="2760">roll it back.</p><p end="2825" is_meta="false" speaker="Philip Zelikow" start="2760">But the point was can they fight?  Yeah, they can fight.  If you give them the kind of</p><p end="2825" is_meta="false" speaker="Philip Zelikow" start="2760">support, they've proven it.   What they want above all is to fight to control their own homes.  Is that a realistic goal?  Yeah.  That's a realistic goal.  That's the goal of national</p><p end="2825" is_meta="false" speaker="Philip Zelikow" start="2760">liberation.  That's not what we were fighting in Vietnam &#8208;&#8208;</p><p end="2882" is_meta="false" speaker="Dov Zakheim" start="2825">Well, first of all we're not talking about patience here.  I thought Anne&#8208;Marie laid it out</p><p end="2882" is_meta="false" speaker="Dov Zakheim" start="2825">very well.  We do want to keep</p><p end="2882" is_meta="false" speaker="Dov Zakheim" start="2825">pushing them.  Nobody said to stop even the</p><p end="2882" is_meta="false" speaker="Dov Zakheim" start="2825">bombing.  We continue with that.  We arm the Kurds.  We do train.  The point is all of</p><p end="2882" is_meta="false" speaker="Dov Zakheim" start="2825">that is not going to defeat ISIS.  It's going to contain ISIS.  That's the point and it's going</p><p end="2882" is_meta="false" speaker="Dov Zakheim" start="2825">to take time.  It's going to take</p><p end="2882" is_meta="false" speaker="Dov Zakheim" start="2825">time to recover from the fact that since 2008 when you</p><p end="2882" is_meta="false" speaker="Dov Zakheim" start="2825">were last there and doing what you did, we are now in 2015.  Seven years and by your</p><p end="2882" is_meta="false" speaker="Dov Zakheim" start="2825">own statement in those seven years we have not progressed.  It takes time and you</p><p end="2882" is_meta="false" speaker="Dov Zakheim" start="2825">have to contain and do the things</p><p end="2882" is_meta="false" speaker="Dov Zakheim" start="2825">we're talking about and that you're talking about.  I'm</p><p end="2882" is_meta="false" speaker="Dov Zakheim" start="2825">still convinced that the reason we sound so similar is they're making the best case for us.</p><p end="2941" is_meta="true" speaker="Dov Zakheim" start="2882">laughter</p><p end="2941" is_meta="false" speaker="Mich&#232;le Flournoy" start="2882">No we aren't.</p><p end="3003" is_meta="false" speaker="Mich&#232;le Flournoy" start="2941">I don't think we need to have a U.S. brand.  I think the most legitimacy &#8208;&#8208; the people we</p><p end="3003" is_meta="false" speaker="Mich&#232;le Flournoy" start="2941">should be supporting in the fight against ISIS are the Sunni &#8208;&#8208; the vast majority of Sunnis</p><p end="3003" is_meta="false" speaker="Mich&#232;le Flournoy" start="2941">in the world who are just as appalled by them and find them just as abhorrent as we do</p><p end="3003" is_meta="false" speaker="Mich&#232;le Flournoy" start="2941">except they're living with them.</p><p end="3003" is_meta="false" speaker="Anne-Marie Slaughter" start="2941">That</p><p end="3003" is_meta="false" speaker="Anne-Marie Slaughter" start="2941">is the crux of our disagreement, right, that we're saying you hold them.  We all</p><p end="3003" is_meta="false" speaker="Anne-Marie Slaughter" start="2941">agree on that.  You're saying you can only win if you roll it back, but what you won't do</p><p end="3003" is_meta="false" speaker="Anne-Marie Slaughter" start="2941">is actually adopt the only strategy that would roll them back, which is massive U.S.</p><p end="3003" is_meta="false" speaker="Anne-Marie Slaughter" start="2941">troops, because</p><p end="3003" is_meta="false" speaker="Anne-Marie Slaughter" start="2941">we have been trying to get Afghans and Iraqis &#8208;&#8208;</p><p end="3003" is_meta="false" speaker="Mich&#232;le Flournoy" start="2941">We have not adequately resourced &#8208;&#8208;</p><p end="3003" is_meta="false" speaker="Anne-Marie Slaughter" start="2941">&#8208;&#8208; and Syrians and everyone else to fight for us and they won't do it in part because</p><p end="3003" is_meta="false" speaker="Anne-Marie Slaughter" start="2941">they've got other enemies, other concerns.

First, we have not adequately resourced or</p><p end="3061" is_meta="false" speaker="Philip Zelikow" start="3003">tried advise and support.  So before you get to that argument the only thing that will</p><p end="3061" is_meta="false" speaker="Philip Zelikow" start="3003">work is a U.S. invasion.  Can we at least just try a proper strategy of advice and</p><p end="3061" is_meta="false" speaker="Philip Zelikow" start="3003">support?  And give it a try because the second flaw in their argument is this, they</p><p end="3061" is_meta="false" speaker="Philip Zelikow" start="3003">assume that this is a stable equilibrium, that a devastated Syria with half the population</p><p end="3061" is_meta="false" speaker="Philip Zelikow" start="3003">displaced and millions of people in refugee camps in all the surrounding states &#8208;&#8208; that</p><p end="3061" is_meta="false" speaker="Philip Zelikow" start="3003">can be stably maintained for who</p><p end="3061" is_meta="false" speaker="Philip Zelikow" start="3003">knows how long to come.  They can just stand on that</p><p end="3061" is_meta="false" speaker="Philip Zelikow" start="3003">tightrope for hours and hours.  We're saying they know they can't stay on that</p><p end="3061" is_meta="false" speaker="Philip Zelikow" start="3003">tightrope.

And there, we have an approach</p><p end="3423" is_meta="false" speaker="Mich&#232;le Flournoy" start="3358">that has not been tried and has not been fully resourced to do that in Iraq. And I think</p><p end="3423" is_meta="false" speaker="Mich&#232;le Flournoy" start="3358">that's a much harder problem in Syria. But there are things that we have not tried that</p><p end="3423" is_meta="false" speaker="Mich&#232;le Flournoy" start="3358">can also do that in</p><p end="3423" is_meta="false" speaker="Mich&#232;le Flournoy" start="3358">Syria.</p><p end="3423" is_meta="false" speaker="Mich&#232;le Flournoy" start="3358">And so, I think getting wrapped around the axle about how much military intervention</p><p end="3423" is_meta="false" speaker="Mich&#232;le Flournoy" start="3358">are we talking about is a very important question. But the fundamental issue is what can</p><p end="3423" is_meta="false" speaker="Mich&#232;le Flournoy" start="3358">and should we do to address those fundamental conditions, because if we don't address</p><p end="3423" is_meta="false" speaker="Mich&#232;le Flournoy" start="3358">them, this threat will reach</p><p end="3423" is_meta="false" speaker="Mich&#232;le Flournoy" start="3358">out and touch America.</p><p end="3423" is_meta="false" speaker="Anne-Marie Slaughter" start="3358">No. I mean, no &#8208;&#8208; there is &#8208;&#8208; I don't think there's anyone in this entire audience who has</p><p end="3423" is_meta="false" speaker="Anne-Marie Slaughter" start="3358">fought as hard as I have, over the past three years, to try to use force</p><p end="3423" is_meta="false" speaker="Anne-Marie Slaughter" start="3358">to bring the civil</p><p end="3423" is_meta="false" speaker="Anne-Marie Slaughter" start="3358">war in Syria to a political conclusion.</p><p end="3479" is_meta="false" speaker="Anne-Marie Slaughter" start="3423">So, we are &#8208;&#8208; you know, if it's a question of what do we do to end the civil war in Syria,</p><p end="3479" is_meta="false" speaker="Anne-Marie Slaughter" start="3423">I've got a whole another strategy.

So, the beginning round of</p><p end="3607" is_meta="false" speaker="Anne-Marie Slaughter" start="3536">this is 1979, with the attack on the great</p><p end="3607" is_meta="false" speaker="Anne-Marie Slaughter" start="3536">mosque in Mecca. And similarly, actually, the Iranian revolution. Then you see the</p><p end="3607" is_meta="false" speaker="Anne-Marie Slaughter" start="3536">Taliban. Then you see Al&#8208;Qaeda.</p><p end="3607" is_meta="false" speaker="Anne-Marie Slaughter" start="3536">Then, as you've heard, you see Boko Haram. You see manifestations of what is a</p><p end="3607" is_meta="false" speaker="Anne-Marie Slaughter" start="3536">decades&#8208;long fight. The Arab Spring is another</p><p end="3607" is_meta="false" speaker="Anne-Marie Slaughter" start="3536">version of it, that says, "This religion is</p><p end="3607" is_meta="false" speaker="Anne-Marie Slaughter" start="3536">deeply, deeply corrupt. It is impossible to have a decent government. We want to purify</p><p end="3607" is_meta="false" speaker="Anne-Marie Slaughter" start="3536">the religion and we want decent governments. And it's just going to keep happening</p><p end="3607" is_meta="false" speaker="Anne-Marie Slaughter" start="3536">until Muslims fight it out. And our argument is we can contain it.</p><p end="3607" is_meta="false" speaker="Anne-Marie Slaughter" start="3536">We obviously have to</p><p end="3607" is_meta="false" speaker="Anne-Marie Slaughter" start="3536">protect ourselves.

These concepts are</p><p end="3663" is_meta="false" speaker="Mich&#232;le Flournoy" start="3607">not operative when you're dealing with ISIS. What are we</p><p end="3663" is_meta="false" speaker="Mich&#232;le Flournoy" start="3607">going to do to deter &#8208;&#8208; I mean,</p><p end="3663" is_meta="false" speaker="Mich&#232;le Flournoy" start="3607">ISIS &#8208;&#8208; deterrence of the Cold War sort does not operate when &#8208;&#8208;</p><p end="3663" is_meta="false" speaker="Anne-Marie Slaughter" start="3607">Sure it does.</p><p end="3663" is_meta="false" speaker="Mich&#232;le Flournoy" start="3607">&#8208;&#8208; you're dealing with a transnational terrorist organization.</p><p end="3663" is_meta="false" speaker="Philip Zelikow" start="3607">What's an example of what's worked with a terror organization?</p><p end="3663" is_meta="false" speaker="Anne-Marie Slaughter" start="3607">Quite the contrary. The example is, as we've also heard from the experts on ISIL, is that</p><p end="3663" is_meta="false" speaker="Anne-Marie Slaughter" start="3607">ISIL thinks that</p><p end="3663" is_meta="false" speaker="Anne-Marie Slaughter" start="3607">Al&#8208;Qaeda's strategy was a failed strategy because they caused a</p><p end="3663" is_meta="false" speaker="Anne-Marie Slaughter" start="3607">catastrophic attack and precisely because we then went in and wiped them out.</p><p end="3732" is_meta="false" speaker="Anne-Marie Slaughter" start="3663">And their strategy is not to do that. So, we of course are still going to protect ourselves.</p><p end="3732" is_meta="false" speaker="Anne-Marie Slaughter" start="3663">If there is such an attack, we</p><p end="3732" is_meta="false" speaker="Anne-Marie Slaughter" start="3663">are going to respond.

One of the things that our</p><p end="4146" is_meta="false" speaker="Mich&#232;le Flournoy" start="4078">partners need to be convinced of is the degree of U.S. commitment.  I think if the U.S.</p><p end="4146" is_meta="false" speaker="Mich&#232;le Flournoy" start="4078">shows that commitment we have a lot of leverage to get others to be using the money</p><p end="4146" is_meta="false" speaker="Mich&#232;le Flournoy" start="4078">they're already putting in</p><p end="4146" is_meta="false" speaker="Mich&#232;le Flournoy" start="4078">to this theater in a much more productive and effective</p><p end="4146" is_meta="false" speaker="Mich&#232;le Flournoy" start="4078">manner.  So, we're not going to be funding this alone. We have 60 nations signed up to</p><p end="4146" is_meta="false" speaker="Mich&#232;le Flournoy" start="4078">help.  What we have to do is use our commitment to better leverage and focus &#8208;&#8208; to</p><p end="4146" is_meta="false" speaker="Mich&#232;le Flournoy" start="4078">better focus the efforts of the whole coalition,</p><p end="4146" is_meta="false" speaker="Mich&#232;le Flournoy" start="4078">and we have not done that.</p><p end="4199" is_meta="false" speaker="Dov Zakheim" start="4146">With respect, you earlier said we don&#8217;t want to rely on the Saudis.

And of course, for years before 9/11, we knew Al&#8208;Qaeda</p><p end="4562" is_meta="false" speaker="Philip Zelikow" start="4503">was at war with us. Well, we weren't sure they were going to come to the homeland.</p><p end="4562" is_meta="false" speaker="Philip Zelikow" start="4503">And besides, if you looked at the problem</p><p end="4562" is_meta="false" speaker="Philip Zelikow" start="4503">&#8208;&#8208; and people did &#8208;&#8208; it was just so hard. Look at</p><p end="4562" is_meta="false" speaker="Philip Zelikow" start="4503">who we'd have to work with in Afghanistan &#8208;&#8208; the Northern Alliance. The politics of the</p><p end="4562" is_meta="false" speaker="Philip Zelikow" start="4503">Northern Alliance were nightmarish.

And of course then came 9/11. And then here I am interviewing generals,</p><p end="4621" is_meta="false" speaker="Philip Zelikow" start="4562">and national security advisers, and even former presidents. And it's "Wish we coulda,</p><p end="4621" is_meta="false" speaker="Philip Zelikow" start="4562">wish we shoulda." All the things that &#8208;&#8208; all the options they thought of doing, they</p><p end="4621" is_meta="false" speaker="Philip Zelikow" start="4562">considered, and they were too</p><p end="4621" is_meta="false" speaker="Philip Zelikow" start="4562">costly, too risky. And the politics of Afghanistan was too</p><p end="4621" is_meta="false" speaker="Philip Zelikow" start="4562">hard. But was it really then better now to then have to occupy Afghanistan and we're</p><p end="4621" is_meta="false" speaker="Philip Zelikow" start="4562">still there 14&#8208;and&#8208;a&#8208;half years later, because we didn't take the risks, the messy politics,</p><p end="4621" is_meta="false" speaker="Philip Zelikow" start="4562">the hard laboring with some effort?

We should protect</p><p end="4732" is_meta="false" speaker="Anne-Marie Slaughter" start="4674">ourselves, absolutely. We should do everything we can diplomatically, digitally. And yes,</p><p end="4732" is_meta="false" speaker="Anne-Marie Slaughter" start="4674">if there is that coalition of</p><p end="4732" is_meta="false" speaker="Anne-Marie Slaughter" start="4674">other states or strong fighters that we can support, I would</p><p end="4732" is_meta="false" speaker="Anne-Marie Slaughter" start="4674">support them. But what's really at issue here &#8208;&#8208; the only thing we're disagreeing about is</p><p end="4732" is_meta="false" speaker="Anne-Marie Slaughter" start="4674">do you stop them where they are or do you roll them back? Do you take away their</p><p end="4732" is_meta="false" speaker="Anne-Marie Slaughter" start="4674">territory?</p><p end="4800" is_meta="false" speaker="Anne-Marie Slaughter" start="4732">And my proposition is that</p><p end="4800" is_meta="false" speaker="Anne-Marie Slaughter" start="4732">if we, the United States, try to lead a coalition to take away</p><p end="4800" is_meta="false" speaker="Anne-Marie Slaughter" start="4732">their territory, we will once again find ourselves in the midst of someone else's fight in a</p><p end="4800" is_meta="false" speaker="Anne-Marie Slaughter" start="4732">way we do not understand, and we're often producing precisely the consequences we</p><p end="4800" is_meta="false" speaker="Anne-Marie Slaughter" start="4732">wish to avoid.</p><p end="4800" is_meta="true" speaker="Anne-Marie Slaughter" start="4732">applause</p><p end="4800" is_meta="false" speaker="Mich&#232;le Flournoy" start="4732">One of the most searing memories of my time in the Pentagon was a visit to Dover Air</p><p end="4800" is_meta="false" speaker="Mich&#232;le Flournoy" start="4732">Force Base. Dover Air Force Base is where the remains of fallen U.S. servicemen in Iraq,</p><p end="4800" is_meta="false" speaker="Mich&#232;le Flournoy" start="4732">Afghanistan, wherever &#8208;&#8208; are brought back to the United States. It is the first place</p><p end="4800" is_meta="false" speaker="Mich&#232;le Flournoy" start="4732">where the families of the fallen are able to receive their loved ones. On the night I was</p><p end="4800" is_meta="false" speaker="Mich&#232;le Flournoy" start="4732">there, my first visit, it was bitterly cold.</p><p end="4861" is_meta="false" speaker="Mich&#232;le Flournoy" start="4800">We were waiting on the tarmac for what seemed like forever, for a large military</p><p end="4861" is_meta="false" speaker="Mich&#232;le Flournoy" start="4800">transport plane to come in. Eventually, the plane came</p><p end="4861" is_meta="false" speaker="Mich&#232;le Flournoy" start="4800">in, landed, and taxied to a stop</p><p end="4861" is_meta="false" speaker="Mich&#232;le Flournoy" start="4800">on the tarmac. Off to the side, nearby, away from the press, was about &#8208;&#8208; were about a</p><p end="4861" is_meta="false" speaker="Mich&#232;le Flournoy" start="4800">dozen grieving, grief&#8208;stricken families who were there to receive a father, a husband, a</p><p end="4861" is_meta="false" speaker="Mich&#232;le Flournoy" start="4800">brother, a daughter, a sister. And we waited for what seemed</p><p end="4861" is_meta="false" speaker="Mich&#232;le Flournoy" start="4800">like an eternity. And</p><p end="4861" is_meta="false" speaker="Mich&#232;le Flournoy" start="4800">eventually, the back of the plane opened to reveal a row of flag&#8208;draped caskets. And</p><p end="4861" is_meta="false" speaker="Mich&#232;le Flournoy" start="4800">one by one, each of those was lovingly carried by a group of soldiers off to an awaiting</p><p end="4861" is_meta="false" speaker="Mich&#232;le Flournoy" start="4800">family. It was a just unbearable and devastating scene. This was the cost</p><p end="4861" is_meta="false" speaker="Mich&#232;le Flournoy" start="4800">&#8208;&#8208; the human</p><p end="4861" is_meta="false" speaker="Mich&#232;le Flournoy" start="4800">cost of war.</p><p end="4925" is_meta="false" speaker="Mich&#232;le Flournoy" start="4861">This was Americans who had sacrificed everything for their country and families who</p><p end="4925" is_meta="false" speaker="Mich&#232;le Flournoy" start="4861">would never again be the same. When we think about how we're going to fight or how</p><p end="4925" is_meta="false" speaker="Mich&#232;le Flournoy" start="4861">we deal with ISIS, we need to think about Dover, the human cost of</p><p end="4925" is_meta="false" speaker="Mich&#232;le Flournoy" start="4861">the choices we</p><p end="4925" is_meta="false" speaker="Mich&#232;le Flournoy" start="4861">make and the choices we fail to make. And I am here today firmly believing that if we do</p><p end="4925" is_meta="false" speaker="Mich&#232;le Flournoy" start="4861">not adopt a more&#8208;robust and well&#8208;resourced strategy, where we're not doing it all by</p><p end="4925" is_meta="false" speaker="Mich&#232;le Flournoy" start="4861">ourselves, but we are leading an international coalition to fight this horrific</p><p end="4925" is_meta="false" speaker="Mich&#232;le Flournoy" start="4861">movement,</p><p end="4925" is_meta="false" speaker="Mich&#232;le Flournoy" start="4861">we will spend more blood and treasure down the road.</p><p end="4977" is_meta="false" speaker="Dov Zakheim" start="4925">In 2002, I was asked to help get troops and funds for that coalition &#8208;&#8208; first the coalition in</p><p end="4977" is_meta="false" speaker="Dov Zakheim" start="4925">Afghanistan, then the coalition in Iraq. I got money. I didn't get any troops from</p><p end="4977" is_meta="false" speaker="Dov Zakheim" start="4925">Muslims. Not one Muslim</p><p end="4977" is_meta="false" speaker="Dov Zakheim" start="4925">country sent troops in, as I recall. Some helped with training in their own countries. To talk of coalitions is to talk, essentially &#8208;&#8208; if the Brits want to</p><p end="4977" is_meta="false" speaker="Dov Zakheim" start="4925">play again &#8208;&#8208; of a U.S.&#8208;U.K, coalition with a lot of other flags. It's not going to work.</p><p end="4977" is_meta="false" speaker="Dov Zakheim" start="4925">General Petraeus is right. The surge worked. Phil, you&#8217;re right. With over 100,000</p><p end="4977" is_meta="false" speaker="Dov Zakheim" start="4925">troops. And</p><p end="4977" is_meta="false" speaker="Dov Zakheim" start="4925">I remember sitting next to the Deputy Secretary of Defense and testifying,</p><p end="4977" is_meta="false" speaker="Dov Zakheim" start="4925">who then said that General Shinseki was wrong when he said we needed several</p><p end="4977" is_meta="false" speaker="Dov Zakheim" start="4925">hundred thousand troops to win in Iraq.</p><p end="5035" is_meta="false" speaker="Dov Zakheim" start="4977">We did put six figures of troops in Iraq. Lots of troops in Afghanistan. But that's behind</p><p end="5035" is_meta="false" speaker="Dov Zakheim" start="4977">us. It's not 9/11 anymore. It's not 9/12. We have a history of being in there. They don't</p><p end="5035" is_meta="false" speaker="Dov Zakheim" start="4977">want us. So, we have this Hobbesian choice: put in loads of troops, beat ISIS back &#8208;&#8208; roll</p><p end="5035" is_meta="false" speaker="Dov Zakheim" start="4977">them back, as you would like &#8208;&#8208; and take the risk of alienating the Arabs. Or</p><p end="5035" is_meta="false" speaker="Dov Zakheim" start="4977">alternately,</p><p end="5035" is_meta="false" speaker="Dov Zakheim" start="4977">holding them in place, doing all the other things you talk about. But it'll take time. It'll</p><p end="5035" is_meta="false" speaker="Dov Zakheim" start="4977">take money. It'll take will. And it ain't going to happen overnight. And I go back to what I</p><p end="5035" is_meta="false" speaker="Dov Zakheim" start="4977">said earlier. You have made the best arguments for containment &#8208;&#8208; with the exception of</p><p end="5035" is_meta="false" speaker="Dov Zakheim" start="4977">my partner, of course &#8208;&#8208; that I've heard tonight. We cannot beat these people unless we</p><p end="5035" is_meta="false" speaker="Dov Zakheim" start="4977">are absolutely committed to more money, more troops, more will. It ain't going to</p><p end="5035" is_meta="false" speaker="Dov Zakheim" start="4977">happen. Thank you.</p></transcript></debate>
