I think violence is why we like it. And, look, nobody has ever accused me of being consistent about anything. I also think there's a vast distinction between what we're arguing here, which is college football versus pro players who are being compensated very, very well for what they do and know the risks going in.</p><p end="416" is_meta="false" speaker="Buzz Bissinger" start="360">College players receive nothing beyond a scholarship that is really of questionable value because of the demands placed upon them. So I think what I've said is very consistent.</p><p end="477" is_meta="false" speaker="Malcolm Gladwell" start="416">Well, the difference in Canada is that we don't care about football.</p><p end="477" is_meta="true" speaker="Malcolm Gladwell" start="416">laughter</p><p end="477" is_meta="false" speaker="Tim Green" start="416">You're going to go there already? Come on, we've got to have some class on this side of the auditorium.</p><p end="543" is_meta="false" speaker="Jason Whitlock" start="477">If we were playing back in the '80s, early '90s when I played, absolutely, because I thought the exchange was fair then.</p><p end="603" is_meta="false" speaker="Jason Whitlock" start="543">Coaches and football wasn't generating as much money. And I was prepared to take advantage of the currency that they were paying me in education. Not all of my teammates were. So yeah, I would do it all again.</p><p end="1021" is_meta="false" speaker="Tim Green" start="966">Thank you. Can I have the two minutes Malcolm didn&#8217;t use? Okay. When I was first asked to do this, I -- of course I asked permission from my wife, as any good husband will, and when she said, &#8220;Well, you know, what&#8217;s the debate?&#8221;</p><p end="1085" is_meta="false" speaker="Tim Green" start="1021">I said, &#8220;Ban college football or not.&#8221; She said, &#8220;Well, that&#8217;s ludicrous. You know, you&#8217;ll win that debate.&#8221; I said, &#8220;Yeah.&#8221; She said, &#8220;You can win the debate, can&#8217;t you?&#8221; I said,</p><p end="1085" is_meta="false" speaker="Tim Green" start="1021">&#8220;Absolutely.&#8221; She said, &#8220;Well, who are you debating?&#8221; I said, &#8220;Buzz Bissinger, Malcolm Gladwell.&#8221; She said, &#8220;You&#8217;ve had too many concussions.&#8221;</p><p end="1085" is_meta="true" speaker="Tim Green" start="1021">laughter</p><p end="1085" is_meta="false" speaker="Tim Green" start="1021">And I have. And I have. And I agree with our opponents, Mr. Gladwell and Mr.</p><p end="1085" is_meta="false" speaker="Tim Green" start="1021">Bissinger, in a lot of ways. Football is a brutal game and I have grave concerns about concussions and the impact of concussions. I also agree that I think college football players, because of the revenues that they generate, should be paid I think a small stipend. I think that they deserve that.</p><p end="1085" is_meta="true" speaker="Tim Green" start="1021">applause</p><p end="1085" is_meta="false" speaker="Tim Green" start="1021">And so in some ways I do agree with them. But banning college football -- I mean, so I had to first -- I had to get over my initial horror at the notion because, of course, football for me has done a lot of tremendous things.</p><p end="1140" is_meta="false" speaker="Tim Green" start="1085">And then I looked at, you know, just our country, our society in general, and I thought about football and what it does in the colleges and how it&#8217;s a unifier. Not just the guys on the teams, not just unifying people from different places and different ethnicities anddifferent religions into one solid unit that learns to work together, but unifying a campus, unifying the students, unifying the faculty, unifying the alumni, unifying sometimes entire towns, communities, and whole cities. And so, in that respect, to me,</p><p end="1140" is_meta="false" speaker="Tim Green" start="1085">I said, you know, &#8220;How could we? How could we ban&#8221; -- college football is a wonderful thing. But then I wanted to look at it and I wanted to look at the numbers, because obviously my opponents are highly intelligent men, they&#8217;re passionate men, they&#8217;re very learned, and I said, you know, &#8220;What is it? What&#8217;s behind this?&#8221;</p><p end="1199" is_meta="false" speaker="Tim Green" start="1140">And so I looked into the numbers as far as what does college football -- what are the benefits of college football and what are the detriments? Well, the detriments certainly are the head injuries. Now, I&#8217;ve got to say this because we&#8217;ve got to get things straight from the beginning about the concussions and the g-forces, because Mr. Gladwell talked about 100 g-forces when you hit your head into a brick wall at 25 miles an hour 30 times a game. That does not happen in a college football game. That does not happen in an NFL football game because when you get hit at 120 -- at 100 Gs, you get a concussion,</p><p end="1199" is_meta="false" speaker="Tim Green" start="1140">and when you get a concussion, now more than ever, you are taken out of the game and you are put into some rehab program. Now, back when I played, back when Jason played, it wasn't like that. It was -- do you know where you are? No. How many fingers do I have up? Four. Okay. That's close enough. You're ready to go back in.</p><p end="1263" is_meta="false" speaker="Tim Green" start="1199">It's not like that anymore. And so the game is evolving to become safer and safer, as safe as it can be. But it will never be completely safe. It won't be completely safe. So what I said to myself is, well, let me look at some things that are maybe as unsafe or maybe even more unsafe than playing the game of football. And so, of course,</p><p end="1263" is_meta="false" speaker="Tim Green" start="1199">automobile accidents came to mind because the mortality rate is about a hundred times higher for men in that age range that they're going to die in an automobile accident than they're going to die on the football field. And then I said, well, look, how about --</p><p end="1263" is_meta="false" speaker="Tim Green" start="1199">how about going out and riding your bicycle? That's right. That's more dangerous, or downhill skiing. And then I said, well, let me look at sports. And so I went to the NCAA,</p><p end="1263" is_meta="false" speaker="Tim Green" start="1199">and I looked at their sports, and I looked at a study that was done at the University of North Carolina. I looked at the study of the fatalities, direct fatalities and the sports that are more dangerous than football. Equestrian riding, female downhill skiing, lacrosse,</p><p end="1263" is_meta="false" speaker="Tim Green" start="1199">water polo and baseball.</p><p end="1321" is_meta="false" speaker="Tim Green" start="1263">And then I went to indirect fatalities, and I looked, and I found that rowing, basketball,</p><p end="1321" is_meta="false" speaker="Tim Green" start="1263">skiing, water polo and swimming are all more dangerous than football. And so if we're going to say, well, football has to be banned, then I think it's only right that we pretty much have to ban all college sports if we're going to do it based on the risks and thesafety. The other thing that I just have to disagree with, with Mr. Gladwell -- and I know this is dangerous territory for me -- but he talked about grown men. And to suggest that college football players at the age of 18, 19, 20, 21 are not grown men, it's -- that's just not true because we'll take 18, 19, 20-year-olds, and we'll send them off to Afghanistan or wherever in the world we need them to help protect our country. And those are grown men. And so at the age of, you know, majority, at 18, I think that they have the --</p><p end="1321" is_meta="false" speaker="Tim Green" start="1263">they have the right to make that decision.</p><p end="1382" is_meta="false" speaker="Tim Green" start="1321">So those are the things that are maybe against. And I don't think that it's that dangerous. What are the things that are for? Education. Mr. Bissinger said, well, you know, all you get is a scholarship. All you get is a scholarship? If you go to my alma mater, that's a $250,000 plus scholarship. That's the value of that education. So you do get an education. How many scholarship football players are there in this country every year? 23,000. And the surplus from the game of football is used for what? Well, maybe it is for research, maybe it is for physical [unintelligible], but a lot of it is also used for Title 9, for opportunities for women athletes to enjoy scholarships and enjoy educations that they might never have had before. And to suggest that football and sports aren't educating, especially football, aren't educating students, I looked at that too. In the general population, students have a graduation rate of 55 percent in this country, and it's going down.</p><p end="1438" is_meta="false" speaker="Tim Green" start="1382">It's of grave concern. NFL -- college football players in the last 25 years have gone from a 60 percent graduation rate to a 70 percent graduation rate. So not only are they being educated, they're being educated at a higher and better rate than their peers. For me,</p><p end="1438" is_meta="false" speaker="Tim Green" start="1382">the game of football -- and I -- well, I was serious about the lessons of football on an individual basis of teamwork, hard work, perseverance and tolerance. And I know my partner, Jason is going to talk more about that when he has his turn. Those are wonderful lessons that, for me, were an education in and of themselves. So I hope that you will all vote tonight to not ban college football. Thank you.</p><p end="1438" is_meta="true" speaker="Tim Green" start="1382">applause</p><p end="1499" is_meta="false" speaker="Buzz Bissinger" start="1438">Thank you. You know, it seems to me that given that this debate is taking place at a university that is one of the greatest and most innovative in the country that doesn't have football, I think this debate ends right now. Our nation is at a cornerstone. There's no doubt about it. We are questioning everything, tax rate, rich versus poor, who are we? What are we? In a very intense&#8212; the most competitive global economy we have ever faced.</p><p end="1566" is_meta="false" speaker="Buzz Bissinger" start="1499">And one of the things that we are looking at and must look at which makes this debate pertinent is the role of the university. It is pivotal. Questions over course offerings,</p><p end="1566" is_meta="false" speaker="Buzz Bissinger" start="1499">allocation of resources in a very difficult era as governors are slashing to the bone,</p><p end="1566" is_meta="false" speaker="Buzz Bissinger" start="1499">dwindling money, rising tuition. And yet, a recent book by two sociologists, Richard Arum and Josipa Roksa says that basically undergraduates embrace college life, and it is shaped and oriented to nonacademic endeavors. The amount of study time has gone --</p><p end="1566" is_meta="false" speaker="Buzz Bissinger" start="1499">and this was by two labor economists. Study time in colleges has gone from over 40 hours in the 1960s to 20 hours in the 1980s to currently 13 hours of study time. And I believe that at the top of what has become the university distraction, the distracted university is football, is football.</p><p end="1615" is_meta="false" speaker="Buzz Bissinger" start="1566">It sucks all the air out of the room. The amount of money that coaches make is insulting. It is insulting when a coach is making five to 10 to 15 times more than a college president. What does it say? What does it say about the priorities of a university? It says that the head coach runs the school. And make no mistake. That was the tragedy of Joe Paterno. He did run Penn State. He did run Penn State. And I know he ran Penn State because when Graham Spanier went to his house in 2004 and said, "Joe, it's time to retire," he threw him out. They never spoke for 10 years. Joe ran that school.</p><p end="1686" is_meta="false" speaker="Buzz Bissinger" start="1615">And when it was his chance to do what was the morally right thing to do, which was to go to the police, the culture of omerta that surrounds football, he did nothing except harbor a suspected child molester. This is what we're dealing with in football. A fewfacts in what they call the football bowl subdivision, the big 125 schools. Spending per student in those schools, $13,471. Spending per athlete, $91,053. 6.8 times as much for a student athlete. In the famed SEC, 11.6 times as much. It's become a facility arms race. $15.2 billion spent on new athletic facilities, in particular, stadiums between 1995 and 2005. 20 percent of current spending that by the way is not included in a lot of the revenue statements you'll see in NCAA reports. And that's not from me, that's from Andrew Zimbalist who is considered the leading sports economic professor in the country from Smith College.</p><p end="1736" is_meta="false" speaker="Buzz Bissinger" start="1686">20 percent of current spending is on facility expansion, which is wonderful except what happens if these teams stop winning? People will not go. They will not go. From USA Today June 16, 2011, more than $470 million, more than $470 million, most of it in student fees by students who do not play sports went into subsidized college athletic programs, in particular in football. And this is in the era, a national trend of declining state support, tuition increases and salary freezes. How many football programs have cut their budgets? A few did in 2010, but it's back up. It is back up. It is back up.</p><p end="1795" is_meta="false" speaker="Buzz Bissinger" start="1736">Salaries of coaches, I mentioned it, average salary for a football coach, $1.47 million.</p><p end="1795" is_meta="false" speaker="Buzz Bissinger" start="1736">That's up 55 percent in six seasons. A professor, 1986 to 2007, his salary went up 30 percent. The college president, 100 percent. The football coach, 500 percent. 500 percent. And I defy both of you to tell me why Urban Meyer deserves, of Ohio State,</p><p end="1795" is_meta="false" speaker="Buzz Bissinger" start="1736">$24 million over six seasons. I defy you to tell me that. I defy you to tell me why Mack Brown deserves $5.192 million, not to mention the $850,000 bonus he will get. And I can go down the ride. Not to mention David Cutcliffe at Duke, which has a terrible football program, but we're seeing $1.762 million.</p><p end="1857" is_meta="false" speaker="Buzz Bissinger" start="1795">And there are all these myths, all of these myths, character, character from CBS/SI poll in 2011, 7 percent of college football players, 7 percent have criminal records, 7 percent.</p><p end="1857" is_meta="false" speaker="Buzz Bissinger" start="1795">2,837 players, they studied the top 25 programs, at the top of the list, Pitt, Pitt, 22 players on the team in 2010 have been charged with a crime. Myth, increased alumni giving, myth, 2005, Robert Frank of the Johnson School of Management at Cornell,</p><p end="1857" is_meta="false" speaker="Buzz Bissinger" start="1795">existing empirical literature supports that success of big time athletics has little if any systematic effect on the quality of incoming freshmen in institutions able to attract.</p><p end="1857" is_meta="false" speaker="Buzz Bissinger" start="1795">That's the -- one of the things about football is it attracts better students&#8230;it does not. It attracts more applications but the students are of low caliber. Myth, football gives back.</p><p end="1916" is_meta="false" speaker="Buzz Bissinger" start="1857">Untrue, untrue, and I'll go into that later. Graduation rates, graduation rates. NCAA has the most ridiculous formula, the graduation success rate, now they've included the Ivy League, it's ridiculous.</p><p end="1916" is_meta="true" speaker="Buzz Bissinger" start="1857">laughter</p><p end="1916" is_meta="false" speaker="Buzz Bissinger" start="1857">And 69 percent, and what is worse, what is worse is that the racial gap between blacks and whites is despicable. I'm done.</p><p end="1916" is_meta="true" speaker="Buzz Bissinger" start="1857">applause</p><p end="1977" is_meta="false" speaker="Jason Whitlock" start="1916">See, I mean, if we lose the debate, I should be blamed because I anticipated all of their arguments and if I do it justice, I will prove how ridiculous their arguments are or just --</p><p end="1977" is_meta="false" speaker="Jason Whitlock" start="1916">not ridiculous because --</p><p end="1977" is_meta="false" speaker="Jason Whitlock" start="1916">-- Mr. Gladwell and Mr. Bissinger are two of the brightest minds that dabble in sports.</p><p end="1977" is_meta="true" speaker="Jason Whitlock" start="1916">laughter</p><p end="1977" is_meta="false" speaker="Jason Whitlock" start="1916">No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. I did not mean that dismissively. Trust me, if you've read their work, if you've read their work, they do much higher end stuff than just sports, and I'm -- they're lending their brains to sports occasionally. But again, I don't mean that -- I mean that with all due respect. We need to keep him -- I will not match Buzz's intensity or passion.</p><p end="2041" is_meta="false" speaker="Jason Whitlock" start="1977">I think I can match wits with him and Mr. Gladwell. Keep in mind, Mr. Gladwell is a Canadian and you guys are -- I'm not playing this for jokes, I'm being serious. We live in a republic, a democracy. Capitalism is our economic system. The thing we value the most is freedom. We're American and if you believe in freedom, you can't have the free without the dumb. You can't have it. They go hand in hand. Freedom allows you to do dumb things, things we find reprehensible.</p><p end="2041" is_meta="true" speaker="Jason Whitlock" start="1977">applause</p><p end="2041" is_meta="false" speaker="Jason Whitlock" start="1977">And I would agree, you can put football right in there with cigarettes, alcohol, porn,</p><p end="2041" is_meta="false" speaker="Jason Whitlock" start="1977">everything else, things that we tolerate and enjoy here in America, but you cannot separate them.</p><p end="2101" is_meta="false" speaker="Jason Whitlock" start="2041">And everything in America is connected to freedom and to capitalism and to democracy.</p><p end="2101" is_meta="false" speaker="Jason Whitlock" start="2041">And so you can't remove our institutions of higher education from capitalism and from freedom. You can't. We don't do that in America. We let capitalism exploit everything whether we like it or not. And so football has to be tolerated no different than Ronald McDonald. Ronald McDonald has done far more damage to America than any football coach, any of these overpaid coaches that he's talking about.</p><p end="2101" is_meta="true" speaker="Jason Whitlock" start="2041">applause</p><p end="2101" is_meta="false" speaker="Jason Whitlock" start="2041">Mr. Bissinger argues rightfully, these coaches are overpaid. Ronald McDonald was overpaid, Hugh Hefner&#8217;s overpaid, Jenna Jameson&#8217;s overpaid, what -- Charlie Sheen&#8217;s overpaid. That&#8217;s America.</p><p end="2101" is_meta="true" speaker="Jason Whitlock" start="2041">applause</p><p end="2160" is_meta="false" speaker="Jason Whitlock" start="2101">Mr. Bissinger argues in the Wall Street Journal and a little bit today that football is removed from the academic experience. He is wrong. People don&#8217;t understand football. Many football players don&#8217;t even understand football. But, and I mean this respectfully, I&#8217;m not playing this for laughs, I&#8217;m not trying to be dismissive, Mr. Gladwell,</p><p end="2160" is_meta="false" speaker="Jason Whitlock" start="2101">Mr. Bissinger, some of our brightest minds, have not participated in football. And many of you in this audience have not participated in football. Football, whether we like it or not, whether you understand it or not when I say it, but football is America. It is the melting pot. College football is the highest level of the melting pot. Football is the Statue of Liberty.</p><p end="2217" is_meta="false" speaker="Jason Whitlock" start="2160">College football. Your huddled masses, your poor, your tired, people yearning to breath free. I was one of those kids. Football was my access into the mainstream and a better life. My dad didn&#8217;t graduate from high school, my mother was a factory worker. I was the first person in my family to go off to college. Football brings the poor and the rich,</p><p end="2217" is_meta="false" speaker="Jason Whitlock" start="2160">the black and the white, the Jews and the gentiles -- it brings everybody together,</p><p end="2217" is_meta="false" speaker="Jason Whitlock" start="2160">particularly at the college level. Your high school experience, for the most part, is segregated. Your little league experience is segregated. Once you go all the way up to the pros, it&#8217;s more segregated because football is a game best played -- pardon, Tim&#8217;s an exception -- by the most desperate people on the planet. It&#8217;s like boxing. That&#8217;s why so many of the football players have hard luck stories in the National Football League.</p><p end="2288" is_meta="false" speaker="Jason Whitlock" start="2217">They came from nothing, they had no other choices, so they had to be good at football.</p><p end="2288" is_meta="false" speaker="Jason Whitlock" start="2217">But on the college level, everybody comes together. And I personally played next to -- I was a tackle, the guy next to me, right guard -- keeping it real, don&#8217;t laugh. The guy next to me was a bigot. His mom left his dad for a black man and he couldn&#8217;t get over it, and he was a bigot. We were very good friends. We&#8217;re still very good friends. We found common ground through football. College football, the bringing together of this diverse cross section of people pursuing one goal. If they understood it on college campuses,</p><p end="2288" is_meta="false" speaker="Jason Whitlock" start="2217">they would teach college football, they would come and study college football and learn things so that -- I&#8217;m a part of the media. I watch our major broadcast media and I watch the clueless, people that don&#8217;t have the diversity of experience that I have through college football and through life and I watch them consistently tear this country apart.</p><p end="2339" is_meta="false" speaker="Jason Whitlock" start="2288">I watched them do it with George Zimmerman, OJ Simpson, Rodney King. Whatever the big media story. Barack Obama. Consistently tear this country apart. The reason why --</p><p end="2339" is_meta="false" speaker="Jason Whitlock" start="2288">and if people have ever read my column and understood my perspective, the reason why I never lose faith in America is because of my college football experience. I have seen people of different backgrounds overcome tremendous differences to compete for one goal. That&#8217;s what we allegedly are trying to do here in America. I think the argument to ban college football is being argued by well-intentioned people who don&#8217;t clearly understand the sport.</p><p end="2394" is_meta="false" speaker="Jason Whitlock" start="2339">America is imperfect. The Statue of Liberty does not promise perfection. Our Constitution doesn&#8217;t promise perfection. We pursue perfection. College football needs to be reshaped, remade, less games, less practice, less padded practice --</p><p end="2394" is_meta="false" speaker="Jason Whitlock" start="2339">It does not need to be banned.</p><p end="2520" is_meta="false" speaker="Tim Green" start="2462">Why shouldn't they be making millions of dollars more? Why -- I mean, this is America.</p><p end="2520" is_meta="false" speaker="Tim Green" start="2462">And Jason said it. This is a country where we allow pop stars and rappers and hedge fund managers -- we allow people to make whatever the market determines that it should make. And I don't understand why we would begrudge anyone any amount of money --</p><p end="2520" is_meta="false" speaker="Malcolm Gladwell" start="2462">Wait. That&#8217;s your defense, that hedge fund managers are just as bad? At this point can&#8217;t we declare the debate over?</p><p end="2520" is_meta="false" speaker="Tim Green" start="2462">What I'm saying is I don't -- I wouldn't begrudge -- I don't begrudge you the revenues from your wonderfully successful books or Buzz, "Friday Night Lights." We're all big fans. I don't begrudge you that. Whatever you get is what you get. And whatever the market determines, that's what you earn.</p><p end="2577" is_meta="false" speaker="Buzz Bissinger" start="2520">I understand, but first of all, these are not for profit institutions. Second of all, athletic departments are notoriously bureaucracy heavy, notorious. Ohio State has an athletic department of 478 people which is twice as much as the English department at Ohio State. So let's face it. It ain't about capitalism because they're nonprofit institutions.</p><p end="2577" is_meta="false" speaker="Buzz Bissinger" start="2520">They're not responsible to stockholders.

The issue is not that football does all kinds of wonderful things. Of course it does. Do football players graduate? Of course they do. Do they learn all kinds of wonderful character things? Absolutely. Butdo we have to bash them over the head in order to communicate those virtues? Why can't they row? Why can't they kick a soccer ball? Why can't they --</p><p end="2703" is_meta="false" speaker="Jason Whitlock" start="2640">They can, but those sports won't generate --</p><p end="2703" is_meta="false" speaker="Jason Whitlock" start="2640">They won't generate enough money to sustain themselves.

They have to get hit over the head because they can't get money otherwise?</p><p end="2703" is_meta="false" speaker="Jason Whitlock" start="2640">In terms of funding all the other sports you're talking about that you like. Yes, they do have to get hit over the head on Saturdays to pay for that, absolutely.</p><p end="2703" is_meta="false" speaker="Buzz Bissinger" start="2640">But Jason, Jason, you're --</p><p end="2703" is_meta="false" speaker="Jason Whitlock" start="2640">To pay for the rowing team and the soccer team and all the other sports that no one cares about.

I don't think that -- and yes, they make news,</p><p end="2883" is_meta="false" speaker="Jason Whitlock" start="2818">and they -- we can write about them, and people will be interested in it. I think what we're arcing, Malcolm, is that's not the case for the overwhelming majority of people that play football, because the overwhelming majority stop in high school. And then the next big group stops at college. And now we have some examples of a few pro athletes that have had these amazing problems. We haven't seen the studies that say college athletes --</p><p end="2883" is_meta="false" speaker="Jason Whitlock" start="2818">-- in any significant number have these problems.</p><p end="2943" is_meta="false" speaker="Tim Green" start="2883">I have concerns, but this is the cell phone syndrome, folks.

And the question for us is --</p><p end="2999" is_meta="false" speaker="Malcolm Gladwell" start="2943">-- until we know, until we know what the extent of the medical damage is, what is the appropriate position to take as custodians of the -- of the personal intellectual development of young people?</p><p end="2999" is_meta="false" speaker="Malcolm Gladwell" start="2943">John Donvan:Buzz Bissinger.</p><p end="2999" is_meta="false" speaker="Buzz Bissinger" start="2943">Well, I mean, listen, our -- have the studies been definitive?

BU has studied the brains of 44 players who died early either because of Alzheimer's, suicide, which is a very, very complex issue, I agree with Jason about why Junior Seau died. We don't know. But in each of those 44 brains, they found advanced CTE. Their brains were shriveled. The first case was Andre Waters who shot himself at the age of 43.</p><p end="3061" is_meta="false" speaker="Buzz Bissinger" start="2999">Forget suicide, when they looked at his brain, they said he had the brain of a 67-year-old man, and you know, you know how Andre Waters played, he probably suffered 25 to 30 concussions during his career. So you have 44 cases in which there were advanced signs of CTE in players who either had Alzheimer's, early Alzheimer's, or died. So there are studies. There are studies. And I --</p><p end="3061" is_meta="false" speaker="Tim Green" start="2999">There are 6,000 former NFL players over the last 20 years, and you're talking about --</p><p end="3061" is_meta="false" speaker="Buzz Bissinger" start="2999">A thousand are filing suit.</p><p end="3061" is_meta="false" speaker="Tim Green" start="2999">Take 6,000 clergymen, 6,000 university professors, 6,000 bus drivers, here's --</p><p end="3061" is_meta="false" speaker="Buzz Bissinger" start="2999">But Tim, there's a class action suit filed by a thousand NFL players.</p><p end="3061" is_meta="false" speaker="Jason Whitlock" start="2999">I don't want to be this cynical, but -- I don't want to be this cynical, but this is also America.

And you guys seem to take the position that until we have definitive proof --</p><p end="3117" is_meta="true" speaker="Malcolm Gladwell" start="3061">talking simultaneously</p><p end="3117" is_meta="false" speaker="Jason Whitlock" start="3061">The appropriate step to take is to walk things back. They're playing too many games, I agree.</p><p end="3179" is_meta="false" speaker="Jason Whitlock" start="3117">They should walk it back to 11 games. The coaches are earning too much.

I mean,</p><p end="3179" is_meta="false" speaker="Tim Green" start="3117">we're not saying, "Oh, you know, just go on -- carry on as usual." Yeah, change the rules a little bit, continue to modify, have the strike zone, no helmets to helmet hits -- hang on, Buzz --</p><p end="3179" is_meta="false" speaker="Buzz Bissinger" start="3117">I'm with you.</p><p end="3179" is_meta="false" speaker="Tim Green" start="3117">Yeah, modify the rules, pay the players, keep making the helmets safer and safer which they are, do everything we can to protect, but don't -- this is America. We don't ban things.</p><p end="3239" is_meta="false" speaker="Tim Green" start="3179">People can burn the flag. We don't ban that. You don't ban college football.</p><p end="3239" is_meta="false" speaker="Buzz Bissinger" start="3179">But the greater issue, which neither of you have answered, is what is the academic purpose of football on a university campus, and why are we the only nation in the world that looks to universities to provide a primary source of athletic entertainment? You talk about kids getting -- you know what the graduation rate of football players should be? 100 percent. Do you know why? They get a free scholarship, not only that --</p><p end="3239" is_meta="false" speaker="Tim Green" start="3179">It's not free, Buzz.</p><p end="3239" is_meta="false" speaker="Buzz Bissinger" start="3179">They get a --</p><p end="3239" is_meta="false" speaker="Tim Green" start="3179">It's not free. You work for it.</p><p end="3239" is_meta="false" speaker="Buzz Bissinger" start="3179">-- Tim, I didn't interrupt you. Do not interrupt me. They get a scholarship. Beyond that,</p><p end="3239" is_meta="false" speaker="Buzz Bissinger" start="3179">you have the Phil Knights and the University of Texas. Phil Knight built a $44 million TajMahal academic support center for student athletes. Why doesn't he build it for the average student? They get tutors.</p><p end="3298" is_meta="false" speaker="Buzz Bissinger" start="3239">They get every ancillary benefit.</p><p end="3298" is_meta="false" speaker="Buzz Bissinger" start="3239">And the graduation rate -- and, by the way, the federal rate is 56 percent because the NCAA has all sorts of gimmicks called its graduation success rate.</p><p end="3298" is_meta="false" speaker="Tim Green" start="3239">I'll concede that instead of 55 it's 56, all right?</p><p end="3298" is_meta="false" speaker="Buzz Bissinger" start="3239">As a --</p><p end="3298" is_meta="false" speaker="Tim Green" start="3239">The money goes to where people pay for it. People want -- look, this is America. People want winners. They wanted the programs to win. And they'll pay for it. I agree with Jason, the coaches should split some of that salary, create a stipend for the players. I'm in full agreement. Again, look it, you guys can't just say, "Well, football needs to change,</p><p end="3298" is_meta="false" speaker="Tim Green" start="3239">there's bad things about it." Yeah, there are. There are some things that are dangerous,</p><p end="3298" is_meta="false" speaker="Tim Green" start="3239">that's unsettling. Are we going to not allow -- no students should allowed to be driving motor vehicles. That is 100 times more dangerous.</p><p end="3298" is_meta="false" speaker="Jason Whitlock" start="3239">I want to ask Buzz -- just one second.</p><p end="3298" is_meta="false" speaker="Jason Whitlock" start="3239">Tim Green:We have to protect our youth.</p><p end="3298" is_meta="false" speaker="Malcolm Gladwell" start="3239">I just have to go back.

Against the general population, which is going down, the football players are going up. And maybe it does require a little bit more money to get them there with the tutors and the academic centers but they are earning it. They are paying for it with their efforts in practice and in the games on Saturday afternoon.</p><p end="3478" is_meta="true" speaker="Tim Green" start="3416">applause</p><p end="3543" is_meta="false" speaker="Malcolm Gladwell" start="3478">Absolutely.</p><p end="3543" is_meta="false" speaker="Malcolm Gladwell" start="3478">For all --</p><p end="3543" is_meta="false" speaker="Buzz Bissinger" start="3478">Well, I mean, it&#8217;s the way -- no, because there is -- the myth of the student athlete is a myth. In the early 1900s, when the Ivy League ruled football, you know what they did?</p><p end="3543" is_meta="false" speaker="Buzz Bissinger" start="3478">They hired these kids, they gave them a shared of the gate receipts, they never went to school, and they were not expected to go to school. This is a myth propagated by people like Grantland Rice, who raise these players to Biblical proportions and Ronald Reagan playing win one for the Gipper.</p><p end="3598" is_meta="false" speaker="Buzz Bissinger" start="3543">Now, in 1950 the average SAT score of an athlete was 18 points below the average student. It is now exponentially lower and I&#8217;m not sure -- and Tim played. But what does football --</p><p end="3598" is_meta="false" speaker="Buzz Bissinger" start="3543">Sure.</p><p end="3598" is_meta="false" speaker="Buzz Bissinger" start="3543">Football does not fit into the process of a college education, not when we rank 14th in the world --</p><p end="3598" is_meta="false" speaker="Buzz Bissinger" start="3543">Rowing may to some degree.</p><p end="3598" is_meta="false" speaker="Buzz Bissinger" start="3543">John Donvan:Why?</p><p end="3598" is_meta="false" speaker="Buzz Bissinger" start="3543">They could all be college sports.</p><p end="3598" is_meta="false" speaker="Buzz Bissinger" start="3543">They could all be club sports. Honestly, we are so athletic-obsessed, and for what? For what? I mean, the number of scholarships that we give out, does Penn State really need 29 varsity sports? Does it?</p><p end="3658" is_meta="false" speaker="Buzz Bissinger" start="3598">Is it right that the single biggest individual contribution given was $70 million for establishment of a Division 1 hockey program at a time when tuition is going up? And I imagine a lot of those students are leaving because they can no longer afford school,</p><p end="3658" is_meta="false" speaker="Buzz Bissinger" start="3598">unlike your football players.</p><p end="3658" is_meta="false" speaker="Tim Green" start="3598">I just don't -- I honestly -- I don't understand why opportunities for student athletes makes you so angry. I don't. I don't understand why you begrudge college athletes scholarships, especially when part of your own argument is that these guys -- these football players and basketball players are being exploited because the revenues that they generate. Those revenues that they generate are used to pay for -- you talked about the expenses that are there, the expenses, it's all part of the show. And they pay for it dearly. They work very hard and you do take risks.</p><p end="3718" is_meta="false" speaker="Tim Green" start="3658">You don't take risks, you know, any more than a lot of other sports. You take less risks than riding a bicycle or driving a car, but you do take risks, and you put forth tremendous effort. And from those efforts, you should -- we're in agreement. You should get something back. So which one is it, Buzz? I mean, do you want -- do you want players to -- football players to have the opportunities of education as compensation for their efforts or don't you? You're mixing messages.</p><p end="3838" is_meta="false" speaker="Buzz Bissinger" start="3783">Well, I don't -- I would think not. I mean, I would think not. But you know, if you want to talk corruption, if you want to talk academic cheating, the numbers --</p><p end="3838" is_meta="false" speaker="Tim Green" start="3783">Let's -- let's answer the question first.</p><p end="3838" is_meta="false" speaker="Buzz Bissinger" start="3783">I said I don't think --</p><p end="3838" is_meta="false" speaker="Tim Green" start="3783">Okay.</p><p end="3838" is_meta="false" speaker="Buzz Bissinger" start="3783">-- that any coach or player, there is a bounty system --</p><p end="3838" is_meta="false" speaker="Tim Green" start="3783">Right.</p><p end="3838" is_meta="false" speaker="Buzz Bissinger" start="3783">-- for any college program.

Let me just -- let me just answer. Let me answer his question, because I do --</p><p end="3838" is_meta="false" speaker="Tim Green" start="3783">-- I do happen to know that. In the National Football League, what happened with the New Orleans Saints was an aberration. In my eight years of playing in the NFL, in my 10 years as a broadcaster for FOX Sports and knowing players intimately throughout the league, I never heard of anything quite like it, neither did anyone else.</p><p end="3899" is_meta="false" speaker="Tim Green" start="3838">By the way, people knew about what was happening with the New Orleans Saints for the past three years. And they were warned over and over again, "We hear this. Youguys better stop. This is absolutely crazy." It's crazy. It's wrong. It was despicable. It's an aberration. It doesn't happen in pro football, other places, and it certainly has no place, and it has not happened to my knowledge in the college [unintelligible].</p><p end="3899" is_meta="false" speaker="Buzz Bissinger" start="3838">No, but I thought we --</p><p end="3899" is_meta="false" speaker="Buzz Bissinger" start="3838">I thought what Tim said, who was in a position to know the best was both eloquent and right and reassuring. Tim played pro football.</p><p end="3899" is_meta="false" speaker="Buzz Bissinger" start="3838">However -- however, let's talk about teams on probation since 2009. Georgia Tech, LSU,</p><p end="3899" is_meta="false" speaker="Buzz Bissinger" start="3838">Michigan, UNC, Alabama, Ohio State, New Mexico, USC, Florida International, Alabama State, West Virginia, Boise State, Hobart -- what the F --</p><p end="3899" is_meta="true" speaker="Buzz Bissinger" start="3838">laughter</p><p end="3899" is_meta="false" speaker="Buzz Bissinger" start="3838">I didn't do it! I didn't do it. Nebraska, Tennessee.</p><p end="3959" is_meta="false" speaker="Buzz Bissinger" start="3899">How many is that? I know you'll say that's anecdotal. Academic cheating, Florida State,</p><p end="3959" is_meta="false" speaker="Buzz Bissinger" start="3899">61 players took online courses where they received answers beforehand or did no work.</p><p end="3959" is_meta="false" speaker="Buzz Bissinger" start="3899">The team had to vacate wins during those seasons. UNC which has been invoked, all these football players for some reason were taking --</p><p end="3959" is_meta="false" speaker="Buzz Bissinger" start="3899">Swahili!</p><p end="3959" is_meta="false" speaker="Jason Whitlock" start="3899">Well, I hate to go back to it, but --</p><p end="3959" is_meta="false" speaker="Buzz Bissinger" start="3899">How can you justify that?</p><p end="3959" is_meta="false" speaker="Jason Whitlock" start="3899">If you have freedom, you're going to have corruption, man.</p><p end="3959" is_meta="false" speaker="Buzz Bissinger" start="3899">Oh, that's a good thing.</p><p end="3959" is_meta="false" speaker="Jason Whitlock" start="3899">That's part of -- I'm -- just probably -- I should just say it. I don't want to be offensive.</p><p end="3959" is_meta="false" speaker="Buzz Bissinger" start="3899">You should become head of Citibank, for God's sake.</p><p end="3959" is_meta="false" speaker="Jason Whitlock" start="3899">But probably --</p><p end="3959" is_meta="true" speaker="Jason Whitlock" start="3899">laughter</p><p end="3959" is_meta="false" speaker="Jason Whitlock" start="3899">I should have taken a job on Wall Street.</p><p end="3959" is_meta="false" speaker="Buzz Bissinger" start="3899">You should have.</p><p end="3959" is_meta="false" speaker="Tim Green" start="3899">Look it, you -- it's dangerous to take -- this is throughout sports at every level, right?</p><p end="3959" is_meta="false" speaker="Tim Green" start="3899">And the more focus and the more attention we pay to it, the more we are interested and drawn to the people who misbehave.</p><p end="4020" is_meta="false" speaker="Tim Green" start="3959">But the vast majority of college football players. You said 7 percent of college football players have been arrested. That's about -- that's probably about the average in the college male population.</p><p end="4020" is_meta="false" speaker="Buzz Bissinger" start="3959">No actually it&#8217;s not.</p><p end="4020" is_meta="false" speaker="Tim Green" start="3959">Wait a minute. Hang on. You're talking about all these people that have -- look, you've got to add the numbers up. If you've got 30 that broke the rules, how many hundreds do you have who didn't break the rules? If you've got a handful of players who committed suicide and then had serious brain damage, which that makes sense, right?</p><p end="4020" is_meta="false" speaker="Tim Green" start="3959">and that horrible tragedy, how many didn't commit suicide?</p><p end="4020" is_meta="false" speaker="Jason Whitlock" start="3959">Buzz is going to be back next month banning marriage because of infidelity.</p><p end="4020" is_meta="true" speaker="Jason Whitlock" start="3959">laughter</p><p end="4088" is_meta="false" speaker="Jason Whitlock" start="4020">I've answered that previously. I think a shorter season, less practice time, sharing the wealth with the athletes would be some -- I think in my day we played 11 games. Now they play 14 or 15 games. It's ridiculous. It's complete and total exploitation. You could -- 10-game season is completely appropriate. To go to a bowl game, you play in 11. You know, just the more contact, the more likely you are to get injured --</p><p end="4088" is_meta="false" speaker="Jason Whitlock" start="4020">-- so less games would be --</p><p end="4088" is_meta="false" speaker="Tim Green" start="4020">I think the colleges should continue to work and with the NFL to continue to research and find better and better equipment to protect the players and to continue to -- to kind of tinker with the rules, create the strike zone for the quarter back, eliminate -- try to eliminate helmet to helmet.</p><p end="4136" is_meta="false" speaker="Tim Green" start="4088">You're never going to eliminate it completely, but have a strict liability code where players who do hit helmet to helmet, you'll remove them from the game, suspend them the next time, and then make it very serious.</p><p end="4136" is_meta="false" speaker="Buzz Bissinger" start="4088">No.</p><p end="4136" is_meta="false" speaker="Malcolm Gladwell" start="4088">I would --</p><p end="4136" is_meta="true" speaker="Malcolm Gladwell" start="4088">laughter</p><p end="4136" is_meta="false" speaker="Buzz Bissinger" start="4088">Well, I mean, I --</p><p end="4136" is_meta="false" speaker="Buzz Bissinger" start="4088">This is a very radical solution. It's got all sorts of problems. I understand that. But people are talking about universities. You license out your name. And basically you're creating a de facto subsidiary. The universities are out of it. You still call it USC. You still call it whatever. You still call it Nebraska. You still call it Syracuse. But it's out of the university system. The university gets a licensing fee. They negotiate it. It basically is a minor league system that is separate. Or, you know what? You get rid of it. You don't penalize the players.</p><p end="4201" is_meta="false" speaker="Buzz Bissinger" start="4136">You know who the biggest villain in this is? The NFL. The NFL does not pay a single dime for what is the greatest boondoggle and farm system ever created.</p><p end="4201" is_meta="false" speaker="Buzz Bissinger" start="4136">So make the NFL pony up with a developmental league.</p><p end="4201" is_meta="false" speaker="Malcolm Gladwell" start="4136">Well, I would -- the thing that I would be happy with is intramural flag football.[laughter]</p><p end="4201" is_meta="false" speaker="Malcolm Gladwell" start="4136">Because you think about it, here's a chance for kids from all kinds of different backgrounds to come together --</p><p end="4201" is_meta="false" speaker="Tim Green" start="4136">You are --</p><p end="4201" is_meta="false" speaker="Malcolm Gladwell" start="4136">-- and learn to play together in hard work and perseverance. I get all misty eyed thinking about it.</p><p end="4201" is_meta="false" speaker="Buzz Bissinger" start="4136">Now, wait a second. Malcolm, no offense, aren't you talking about gay marriage?</p><p end="4201" is_meta="true" speaker="Buzz Bissinger" start="4136">laughter</p><p end="4257" is_meta="false" speaker="Buzz Bissinger" start="4201">-- if at this point I haven't made the point, then I'm really screwed --</p><p end="4257" is_meta="true" speaker="Buzz Bissinger" start="4201">laughter</p><p end="4257" is_meta="false" speaker="Buzz Bissinger" start="4201">-- because first of all, and I didn't mention this, 43 percent of the top 125 programs lose money on football. Now, how -- any program that --</p><p end="4257" is_meta="false" speaker="Buzz Bissinger" start="4201">Any -- so 43 percent lose money.</p><p end="4318" is_meta="false" speaker="Buzz Bissinger" start="4257">Why do they maintain football programs? Tim and I talked about this yesterday,</p><p end="4318" is_meta="false" speaker="Buzz Bissinger" start="4257">because for some --</p><p end="4318" is_meta="false" speaker="Buzz Bissinger" start="4257">Because it has nothing to do with the academic -- I'm amazed -- aren't you concerned --</p><p end="4318" is_meta="false" speaker="Buzz Bissinger" start="4257">It does -- has nothing to do --</p><p end="4318" is_meta="false" speaker="Tim Green" start="4257">Can I answer?</p><p end="4318" is_meta="false" speaker="Tim Green" start="4257">Can I -- in your farm team system, where every school gets to have their own farm team,</p><p end="4318" is_meta="false" speaker="Tim Green" start="4257">do the players get to go to class? Do they get an education at the same time?</p><p end="4318" is_meta="false" speaker="Buzz Bissinger" start="4257">I would think you would give the -- you know, it's an unwieldy mechanism. I think you give the players that option. If they want to be called, "student athletes," and they're actually going to class and they're interested in getting an education, fine, if they don't want to go, don't make them because I have a feeling that most of them probably don't want to go.</p><p end="4318" is_meta="false" speaker="Buzz Bissinger" start="4257">-- easy course list, that's why UNC has an easy course list --</p><p end="4375" is_meta="false" speaker="Tim Green" start="4318">Well, you know, you've got to quantify that, but why do you think -- if they don't want to go, why do you think 70 percent are graduating as opposed to 55, 56 percent of everyone else?</p><p end="4375" is_meta="false" speaker="Buzz Bissinger" start="4318">Well, I said, because in many cases, you know --</p><p end="4375" is_meta="false" speaker="Buzz Bissinger" start="4318">What --</p><p end="4375" is_meta="false" speaker="Buzz Bissinger" start="4318">John Donvan:All right, let him finish -- let him answer.</p><p end="4375" is_meta="false" speaker="Tim Green" start="4318">Why are so many football players graduating if they don't want their degree and they don't want to go to class and they don't want to go to school? You're taking -- you --</p><p end="4375" is_meta="false" speaker="Tim Green" start="4318">Yeah.</p><p end="4375" is_meta="false" speaker="Buzz Bissinger" start="4318">Why?</p><p end="4375" is_meta="false" speaker="Tim Green" start="4318">Yeah.</p><p end="4375" is_meta="false" speaker="Buzz Bissinger" start="4318">Because it's a game and because the NCAA knows and college football knows that we're under a lot of scrutiny for our graduation rates so they push him through. Why does Stanford have an easy class list that football players -- "Here are the classes you take."</p><p end="4375" is_meta="false" speaker="Buzz Bissinger" start="4318">Why? Tim, why?

I mean, if 50 years ago or 75 years ago the major colleges had all decided that they would compete at Monopoly --</p><p end="4506" is_meta="true" speaker="Malcolm Gladwell" start="4435">laughter</p><p end="4506" is_meta="false" speaker="Malcolm Gladwell" start="4435">-- and that somehow Monopoly had gotten lodged in the imagination of the American scholar Monopoly player. And that they started to give out scholarships for Monopoly players and then the Monopoly coaches earned millions of dollars and they built large stadia, which 1,000 people would come to watch the Monopoly players compete against each other.</p><p end="4560" is_meta="false" speaker="Malcolm Gladwell" start="4506">And then suddenly it was observed that Monopoly had gotten out of control and we said, &#8220;Maybe it&#8217;s time for us to turn our back on Monopoly.&#8221; I can imagine the two of you just standing up there and saying, &#8220;No.&#8221; There&#8217;s something magical about this game.</p><p end="4560" is_meta="false" speaker="Malcolm Gladwell" start="4506">My point is there is nothing -- it&#8217;s just a game. Replace it with another game.</p><p end="4560" is_meta="false" speaker="Malcolm Gladwell" start="4506">Yeah.</p><p end="4560" is_meta="false" speaker="Malcolm Gladwell" start="4506">John Donvan:-- her question is she feels that this effect is there and is real, and I want to ask you if you think it&#8217;s there and if it&#8217;s real and if it&#8217;s worth it.</p><p end="4560" is_meta="false" speaker="Malcolm Gladwell" start="4506">My point is --</p><p end="4560" is_meta="false" speaker="Malcolm Gladwell" start="4506">My point is it&#8217;s probably real but you could get it with something else.

If a team is winning and successful with certain exceptions like a Texas or an LSU or an Alabama, if you&#8217;re winning students go, alumni go, if you&#8217;re losing they tend not to go.</p><p end="4626" is_meta="false" speaker="Buzz Bissinger" start="4560">I&#8217;m not sure if you&#8217;re saying that the 25 biggest, best universities in the world have superb football programs because I don&#8217;t think that&#8217;s correct. I just don&#8217;t, because on that list is Harvard, Yale, Penn, University of Chicago, and last time I checked the Ivy League sucks.</p><p end="4626" is_meta="true" speaker="Buzz Bissinger" start="4560">laughter</p><p end="4626" is_meta="false" speaker="Buzz Bissinger" start="4560">But, anyway, it does bring students together. But -- however, there was a study done at the University of Oregon by several economists that was in the National Economic Review that showed when the Oregon football team was winning men&#8217;s grades went down significantly. They did -- you might think it&#8217;s a laugh but it&#8217;s not. By an equivalent of 27 SAT points, they studied half as much, and they drank twice as much. So that&#8217;s what football does. It makes you drunk and stupid.</p><p end="4626" is_meta="true" speaker="Buzz Bissinger" start="4560">applause</p><p end="4742" is_meta="false" speaker="Tim Green" start="4679">-- &#8220;and get back up.&#8221;</p><p end="4742" is_meta="false" speaker="Tim Green" start="4679">Oh, it does.</p><p end="4742" is_meta="false" speaker="Tim Green" start="4679">Oh, okay.

It goes to, frankly, our celebration of -- we like being a violent, hard-assed country. What I resent is that why don&#8217;t you get all those things in the school newspaper when you put on a play? When you&#8217;re in the orchestra you get all these things. Perseverance, caring. Football players don&#8217;t really have to deal with people. They&#8217;re told by 23 coaches what to do and all those pursuits have much more long-lived academic pursuits.</p><p end="4809" is_meta="false" speaker="Buzz Bissinger" start="4742">You have to write.</p><p end="4809" is_meta="false" speaker="Buzz Bissinger" start="4742">You have to learn critical thinking.</p><p end="4809" is_meta="false" speaker="Jason Whitlock" start="4742">Well, I think on a college campus a lot of those endeavors that you&#8217;re talking about, and some of them -- I participated in my school newspaper. Again, those tend to be segregated endeavors that don&#8217;t reach the cross section of people that football does and, you know, that&#8217;s unfortunate. But it&#8217;s the American reality, and football is the one thing on the field and even in the stands that seems to bring America together across a lot of different backgrounds.</p><p end="4809" is_meta="false" speaker="Jason Whitlock" start="4742">John Donvan:Buzz Bissinger.</p><p end="4809" is_meta="false" speaker="Buzz Bissinger" start="4742">Henry Gates, Sports Illustrated 1981. And we all know who he is and I think we respect him obviously. &#8220;The blind pursuit of attainment in sports is having a devastating effect on our people. Imbued with a belief that our principal avenue is to face and -- is to profit through sports, far too many black kids treat basketball courts and football fields as if they were classrooms in an alternate school system."</p><p end="4854" is_meta="false" speaker="Buzz Bissinger" start="4809">That's Henry Gates. Henry Gates. Now, Henry Gates also -- and then I'll stop. Henry Gates, he went back to his hometown. He asked people, how many black pro athletes do you think there were? The guesses were wild. Half a million, 50,000. But what he was distressed by -- no one believed him when he said there are 12 times more black lawyers than pro athletes. 20 times more dentists and 15 times more doctors. So I frankly think that you are selling a bill of goods to inner city kids that athletics is the way out because there are a lot of other ways out.</p><p end="4854" is_meta="true" speaker="Buzz Bissinger" start="4809">applause</p><p end="4854" is_meta="false" speaker="Jason Whitlock" start="4809">There's many --</p><p end="4918" is_meta="false" speaker="Jason Whitlock" start="4854">Because it's America, and because of freedom, you have to take responsibility for yourself. And so trust me, having gone through the athletic and academic experience,</p><p end="4918" is_meta="false" speaker="Jason Whitlock" start="4854">Ball State University and every other university that my friends attended, they put all the academic goodies right on the table for you to take. And sometimes they put you in a -- you know, get your head and try to stuff the academic -- it's up to you to open your mouth and take it. That's America. And so these issues, whether we're trying to reduce to black and white sometimes are far more complicated, and it has to do with -- for me,</p><p end="4918" is_meta="false" speaker="Jason Whitlock" start="4854">I tried to quit college football. My parents wouldn't allow it. Would not allow it.</p><p end="5100" is_meta="false" speaker="Jason Whitlock" start="5036">I would not do away with them because, you know, I am pro restraint on freedom within reason. And so no, I actually think it's for the players' best benefit to go on and participate in college football. You know, so no, I'm not for capitalism. We need a system of checks and balances throughout our society. And so there need to be --</p><p end="5100" is_meta="false" speaker="Malcolm Gladwell" start="5036">Wait. Now I'm really confused. I've just been listening to you for the last half hour going on about freedom and dumbing. And all of a sudden now you're not for freedom any more.</p><p end="5100" is_meta="false" speaker="Jason Whitlock" start="5036">Well, no, I am for freedom, but --</p><p end="5100" is_meta="false" speaker="Malcolm Gladwell" start="5036">Except when you're not.</p><p end="5100" is_meta="false" speaker="Jason Whitlock" start="5036">No. That's why we have government and rules and regulations. And there are restraints on freedom. We can't kill each other.</p><p end="5160" is_meta="false" speaker="Buzz Bissinger" start="5100">Well, then Jason, let me ask you this.</p><p end="5160" is_meta="false" speaker="Buzz Bissinger" start="5100">And no offense. You definitely had concussions when you played. I'm convinced of that. But anyway, I know that was inappropriate. All right.</p><p end="5160" is_meta="false" speaker="Jason Whitlock" start="5100">No. That was a good joke. Buzz and I are friends.</p><p end="5160" is_meta="false" speaker="Buzz Bissinger" start="5100">Anyway, I was doing so well up until then.</p><p end="5160" is_meta="false" speaker="Buzz Bissinger" start="5100">Jason Whitlock:Buzz plays rough, I can handle it.</p><p end="5160" is_meta="false" speaker="Buzz Bissinger" start="5100">Are in favor, then of an antitrust exemption and many labor economists are who study sports in which no head coach gets more than $400,000 a year, which is a lot of money.</p><p end="5160" is_meta="false" speaker="Buzz Bissinger" start="5100">Are you in favor of that?</p><p end="5160" is_meta="false" speaker="Jason Whitlock" start="5100">400,000, I don't know if that would be my limit. But yeah, I'm for -- I wish Congress or our government would step in and put some restraints on the NCAA and college football.</p><p end="5160" is_meta="false" speaker="Buzz Bissinger" start="5100">And let's face it. The only reason that three-year rule is in effect is because -- and I think Tim will agree -- you need that amount of time to develop as a football player.</p><p end="5160" is_meta="false" speaker="Tim Green" start="5100">Right.</p><p end="5160" is_meta="false" speaker="Buzz Bissinger" start="5100">-- to be ready for the pros. So that's the only reason. You know, it's what the NFL wants. And basketball, which frankly -- major college basketball is in worse shape than football because of the one year and out.</p><p end="5217" is_meta="false" speaker="Buzz Bissinger" start="5160">You know, the five starting players of Kentucky, all the freshmen are leaving school. So,</p><p end="5217" is_meta="false" speaker="Buzz Bissinger" start="5160">you know, everything is done basically for the sake either of money or so-called branding or the pros.</p><p end="5217" is_meta="false" speaker="Jason Whitlock" start="5160">Setting a precedent that could be used to ban basketball next.</p><p end="5280" is_meta="false" speaker="Buzz Bissinger" start="5217">Tim has played football. He has spoken, I think, very eloquently about why it is a special game. It is a special game. I love football. I do not think it has any academic purpose.</p><p end="5280" is_meta="false" speaker="Buzz Bissinger" start="5217">And --</p><p end="5280" is_meta="false" speaker="Buzz Bissinger" start="5217">Wait. Other teams -- but you know, you do it. You do it. The University of Chicago which was in the Big 10, and Jay Berwanger had won the Heisman trophy six years earlier in the Big 10. Robert Hutchins said, you know what? This serves absolutely no academic purpose, no academic purpose. And he said, I know a lot of students at my school who can win 12 letters but don't know how to write one. And you know what?</p><p end="5280" is_meta="false" speaker="Buzz Bissinger" start="5217">They got rid of it. They got rid of it. Schools can get rid of it. BU got rid of it.</p><p end="5280" is_meta="false" speaker="Buzz Bissinger" start="5217">Northeastern got rid of it. Schools get rid of it.</p><p end="5337" is_meta="false" speaker="Buzz Bissinger" start="5280">You ban it.</p><p end="5337" is_meta="false" speaker="Buzz Bissinger" start="5280">You know what you do? You ban it. College presidents ban it and then let people sue and let -- then it takes -- who knows?</p><p end="5337" is_meta="false" speaker="Malcolm Gladwell" start="5280">Two weeks ago at the University of Florida, they shut down their computer science department, and they added $2 million a year to their athletic budget, bringing their --</p><p end="5337" is_meta="false" speaker="Malcolm Gladwell" start="5280">the football program share of that budget to $78 million. Now, they didn't think of the banning of computer science at the University of Florida as setting a dangerous precedent.</p><p end="5337" is_meta="false" speaker="Malcolm Gladwell" start="5280">So if that's the case, I'm not so worried about the football --</p><p end="5337" is_meta="false" speaker="Tim Green" start="5280">Why can't we -- to Jason's point about freedom, why can't Florida spend their money on one thing instead of another? Why can't the University of Chicago discontinue football and focus on academics?</p><p end="5403" is_meta="false" speaker="Tim Green" start="5337">This is -- why can't we choose? Why can't we choose? And if someone is -- if a football program is losing money, and a school wants to discontinue it, well, why don't they?</p><p end="5403" is_meta="false" speaker="Tim Green" start="5337">Why don't they? They don't because somewhere along the line some benefit is inuring to that university. And that's why they do it. And I just don't understand why you'd say,</p><p end="5403" is_meta="false" speaker="Buzz Bissinger" start="5337">But, you know, it's not going to ban itself because the amount of money that is now involved that has been poured in that certainly wasn't there in the '60s by ESPN and CBS -- is so enormous that it's just going to create a bigger and bigger monster. And I guess,</p><p end="5403" is_meta="false" speaker="Buzz Bissinger" start="5337">I don't know, call me silly. These are difficult times for this country. We can put our head in the sand, and sing the National Anthem, and say everything's going to be great,</p><p end="5403" is_meta="false" speaker="Buzz Bissinger" start="5337">and we can believe in myths, a great country changes.</p><p end="5454" is_meta="false" speaker="Buzz Bissinger" start="5403">There was no China in the 1960s that was competing. There was no India. There was no South Korea. And, call me na&#239;ve, I really do think that these universities have to be almost exclusively about education. And one other thing, you asked about getting rid of sports? I'll tell you why it wouldn't be a bad idea, because then, that's actually the best argument for keeping football, you keep football, you keep basketball, you get rid of all the other sports that they pay for so that money at least goes into the general fund so the average student is getting something out of it.</p><p end="5454" is_meta="false" speaker="Tim Green" start="5403">Well, I mean, that's another debate, whether --</p><p end="5454" is_meta="false" speaker="Tim Green" start="5403">-- we want to ban all non-revenue producing sports. Again, those are -- create opportunities for people, and for men, and for women, and I think universities are about opportunities.</p><p end="5516" is_meta="false" speaker="Tim Green" start="5454">And the other thing, I just want to say this because you mentioned something that's absolutely wonderful, Buzz, before every football game and before every athletic contest at the high school level and in the college level, everyone, everyone, both sides,we stand up and -- if we don't sing, at least we stand and respectfully observe the Star Spangled Banner, this country's song. And, you know, our National Anthem, what a beautiful thing, that's the only place where a community, where an entire school comes together and stands up and respects the National Anthem. You don't do it anywhere else in the college experience.</p><p end="5516" is_meta="false" speaker="Buzz Bissinger" start="5454">But on a very, very minor, minor scale.</p><p end="5577" is_meta="false" speaker="Buzz Bissinger" start="5516">No, you get a rich benefactor, and there are plenty out there who will pay for the program because frankly that's what's happening now. The next phase of college football will be Boone Pickens. Why is Oklahoma State so good? Because he's given $300 million to the football program. The University of Oregon, it came out of nowhere to be a football power. Why? Because of the hundreds of millions given by Phil Knight.</p><p end="5577" is_meta="false" speaker="Buzz Bissinger" start="5516">If you want to have women's swimming, you have a benefactor pay for it.</p><p end="5642" is_meta="false" speaker="Buzz Bissinger" start="5577">And you know as well as I do that Chicago is in a very, very different place than the 125 BCS schools. There is no question that places like Chicago and Harvard and Wesleyan where kids don't think that they're going to be pro football players, the most formidable person I have ever met is an athlete because they don't quit. But you know what the problem with athletes are? You know where they do the best? Wall Street. And you know why Wall Street is so screwed up? It&#8217;s because athletes --</p><p end="5642" is_meta="false" speaker="Buzz Bissinger" start="5577">-- it's true, athletes don't know when to quit. They're only about winning.</p><p end="5642" is_meta="true" speaker="Buzz Bissinger" start="5577">applause</p><p end="5697" is_meta="false" speaker="Malcolm Gladwell" start="5642">We're not talking about taking sports out of the curriculum. We're talking about banning semi professional -- or -- Buzz might have a slightly different interpretation of this than me -- but I think that if you look at schools like for example MIT, which has one of the highest participation rates in intramural sports in the country, their level of play is far higher than everybody else's, perhaps as a consequence of the fact that they&#8217;ve turned their backs on big time college sports.</p><p end="5758" is_meta="false" speaker="Malcolm Gladwell" start="5697">So I think you could -- if we focused on precisely what John Dewey was interested in doing, which is bringing sports down to the level of the average -- the ordinary student,</p><p end="5758" is_meta="false" speaker="Malcolm Gladwell" start="5697">then that would be more easily achieved if we got away from this preoccupation with these enormously costly and dangerous spectacles.</p><p end="5758" is_meta="false" speaker="Buzz Bissinger" start="5697">And just to clarify, I mean, you could have -- people might not like it -- you could have wonderful club sports that could be very, very competitive. I mean, you can have a schedule. The amount of travel the teams do is ridiculous. You can have a schedule where you&#8217;re competing against regional teams. I think John Dewey was talking about the development of the whole individual. The fact is, there&#8217;s no phys-ed anymore in schools. Everything is about and by and for the athlete. And what happens is you create the athletic culture.</p><p end="5758" is_meta="false" speaker="Jason Whitlock" start="5697">You&#8217;re limiting access for a lot of people, so --</p><p end="5758" is_meta="false" speaker="Tim Green" start="5697">You&#8217;re not going to have college scholarships for the athletes.</p><p end="5819" is_meta="false" speaker="Tim Green" start="5758">And, I mean, one thing I do want to say, though, is almost this line. I mean, are we talking about banning college football or are we talking about only banning college football if it&#8217;s Division 1 college football? Are we talking about Division 3, Division 2 football? That&#8217;s okay? But Division 1 --</p><p end="5819" is_meta="false" speaker="Tim Green" start="5758">Buzz Bissinger:No, because, I mean, I --</p><p end="5819" is_meta="false" speaker="Tim Green" start="5758">No?</p><p end="5819" is_meta="false" speaker="Buzz Bissinger" start="5758">You know, I think the model of Division 2 and Division 3 is better. I think if you read William Bowen&#8217;s book, I think it&#8217;s called &#8220;Game of Play,&#8221; it&#8217;s a fantastic book based on data that he got from the Ivy League and from Duke. I mean, the one thing he did point out, and the little three, he said, &#8220;It&#8217;s a total fallacy to think that the Ivy League does not recruit and does not play games with scholarships and that Williams actually gives more athletic preference to athletes than the University of Michigan.&#8221; I think all these programs are loss leaders and, you know, look --</p><p end="5819" is_meta="false" speaker="Tim Green" start="5758">You&#8217;re saying ban college football --</p><p end="5819" is_meta="false" speaker="Buzz Bissinger" start="5758">I&#8217;m advocating -- here&#8217;s what I&#8217;m --</p><p end="5819" is_meta="false" speaker="Tim Green" start="5758">-- entirely?</p><p end="5819" is_meta="false" speaker="Buzz Bissinger" start="5758">No, but I&#8217;m advocating that there are other ways to do it. Whether it&#8217;s a minor league season, whether it&#8217;s an NFL developmental system, why not the European model?</p><p end="5878" is_meta="false" speaker="Buzz Bissinger" start="5819">The European model. They don&#8217;t use their colleges and universities to create soccer players. They have sports academies, they have schools. They&#8217;ve plucked players as young as six because they say, &#8220;All right, you want to be a soccer player, you&#8217;re showing talent,&#8221; and they go to school there. And the other thing they do that is smart and beneficial is if you&#8217;re not going to make it, you&#8217;re weeded out early so you learn --</p><p end="5878" is_meta="false" speaker="Buzz Bissinger" start="5819">-- at an early age --</p><p end="5878" is_meta="false" speaker="Tim Green" start="5819">So we&#8217;re not going to ban college football, we&#8217;re just going to change it? Because we&#8217;re going to have colleges that have football teams and some of those players, the players who want, get to go and get their education so they still have --</p><p end="5878" is_meta="false" speaker="Buzz Bissinger" start="5819">No, I think we ban college football and then you have a developmental system for those who are --</p><p end="5878" is_meta="false" speaker="Tim Green" start="5819">That are --</p><p end="5878" is_meta="false" speaker="Buzz Bissinger" start="5819">-- at the higher echelons of competition. And for the rest of the schools --</p><p end="5878" is_meta="false" speaker="Tim Green" start="5819">That are called Syracuse University, Texas Longhorns --</p><p end="5878" is_meta="false" speaker="Buzz Bissinger" start="5819">Yeah, you --</p><p end="5878" is_meta="false" speaker="Tim Green" start="5819">-- Oklahoma Sooners?</p><p end="5878" is_meta="false" speaker="Buzz Bissinger" start="5819">I mean, you license it out.</p><p end="5878" is_meta="false" speaker="Tim Green" start="5819">Okay.</p><p end="5878" is_meta="false" speaker="Buzz Bissinger" start="5819">You license it out.</p><p end="5878" is_meta="false" speaker="Tim Green" start="5819">As long as they can go to school and so those 70 percent that want to get their education can get it, I think it&#8217;s great.</p><p end="5963" is_meta="false" speaker="Buzz Bissinger" start="5878">Yeah, that [inaudible] --</p><p end="5963" is_meta="false" speaker="Tim Green" start="5878">There is no question that there are problems with college football, as there are problems with almost every institution in this country. But I hope that, after some of the things you&#8217;ve heard tonight from Jason and from me, people who&#8217;ve benefited from the education of college -- the education we had on the football field with the perseverance, the hard work, the teamwork, the tolerance, and the benefits that accrued to us through our education, where we earned the opportunity to get college degrees, where -- and sometimes some of the people who get those degrees wouldn&#8217;t have another way to get them except through football scholarships.</p><p end="6004" is_meta="false" speaker="Tim Green" start="5963">So there are great things. They unify our communities in many instances. They unify campuses and colleges, and the reason why it&#8217;s there is because it is doing good things and yes it&#8217;s making money and yes the coaches are making money and this is America.</p><p end="6004" is_meta="false" speaker="Tim Green" start="5963">It&#8217;s capitalism, I&#8217;m sorry. Brad Pitt makes $25 million to make a movie. That&#8217;s just our --</p><p end="6004" is_meta="false" speaker="Tim Green" start="5963">that&#8217;s our society. So we pay people what the market says we should pay them.</p><p end="6004" is_meta="false" speaker="Tim Green" start="5963">Football, there are concussions, but there are no studies so far that link that to anything other than some isolated instances.</p><p end="6062" is_meta="false" speaker="Tim Green" start="6004">So football -- and it's evolving. With the equipment and the rules, it can continue to get better. But to end it, to me -- Malcolm Gladwell may be best known for his book called"</p><p end="6062" is_meta="false" speaker="Tim Green" start="6004">Blink." And in that book, it says that when you're faced with a crucial decision or any decision, just listen to the premise and then give your immediate impression. So that'swhat I want to ask you to do tonight. Think about this. Think about, are we going to ban college football, and in a blink, I think you'll vote that we will not.</p><p end="6062" is_meta="false" speaker="Buzz Bissinger" start="6004">Look, there's no question, this is a radical solution.</p><p end="6115" is_meta="false" speaker="Buzz Bissinger" start="6062">But I think it is called for in what are radical times. I am surprised that Tim and Jason seem not to be affected at all about our lagging academic performance, that we're now 14th in the world in math and reading and science when we used to be first, that we're 16th in educational attainment, meaning that other countries are catching up and catching up rapidly and exceeding us when we used to be first. We simply do not have time to waste. Universities were set up for a primary academic purpose. They were not set up as sports factories disguised as universities. And I understand the graduation rate is 69 percent. I think it's ginned up.</p><p end="6178" is_meta="false" speaker="Buzz Bissinger" start="6115">I think a lot of players, and I think even Tim would -- he'll admit this to me privately afterwards -- a lot of players are pushed through and passed through with no demands placed upon him. And I know the impact. I did write a book called "Friday Night Lights"</p><p end="6178" is_meta="false" speaker="Buzz Bissinger" start="6115">in which the cornerstone character was a black running back named Boobie Miles. Now,</p><p end="6178" is_meta="false" speaker="Buzz Bissinger" start="6115">this was high school. And I saw what happened as many college players are when you are treated as a football animal, when you pass -- because the word on the street is --</p><p end="6178" is_meta="false" speaker="Buzz Bissinger" start="6115">with the professors is, "You better pass that kid or there's going to be trouble." Boobie Miles got no education. He was a football animal. He was considered dysfunctional,</p><p end="6178" is_meta="false" speaker="Buzz Bissinger" start="6115">basically an idiot, which he was not. And I'll tell you, with no education, his life has been nothing, nothing but a horrendous hell and a lot of broken dreams that football propagates more than any other sport.</p><p end="6243" is_meta="false" speaker="Jason Whitlock" start="6178">I want to start where I began by -- Mr. Gladwell, Mr. Bissinger, Malcolm, Buzz, two of the brightest minds I have ever encountered. And I -- when I said that comment about them dabbling in sports, it's because most of the time they apply their mind to much bigger issues than sports. And so it's been a worthy debate. Mr. Gladwell began talking about the purpose of schools. And overall education is about preparing you for life.</p><p end="6243" is_meta="false" speaker="Jason Whitlock" start="6178">And I think if they had a bit more experience with college football, actual participation,</p><p end="6243" is_meta="false" speaker="Jason Whitlock" start="6178">and then I don't mean that in any kind of dismissive way.</p><p end="6302" is_meta="false" speaker="Jason Whitlock" start="6243">But it's something you have to experience, because I don't think most people understand the educational benefits of college football. And it's dismissed as a bunch of dummies. Brady Hoke, the head football coach at the University of Michigan is a very good friend of mine. He played football at Ball State University. He had been the head coach of Ball State University. I have watched him up close and personal in this era reach kids at Ball State University and San Diego State University and now at the University of Michigan, with an entire leadership program and men-building program that he and his strength coach implement throughout a player's four and-five-year career. And it helps develop the overall person. And it helps prepare the athlete for life in the real world.</p><p end="6359" is_meta="false" speaker="Jason Whitlock" start="6302">That is a school's purpose. If we truly understood football and what was transpiring, I don't think anyone would argue that it's not part of the academic experience. It may be part of the academic experience that some people don't respect because they don't understand it, but trust me, it is a big part of the academic experience. It's not perfect.</p><p end="6359" is_meta="false" speaker="Jason Whitlock" start="6302">It can be improved. It can be more like the Ivy League system. But there's no way we should ban football.</p></transcript></debate>
