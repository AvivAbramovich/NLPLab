He has been following the global debate very closely, and he's aware of this debate tonight.</p><p end="543" is_meta="false" speaker="Ben Wizner" start="484">Well, you know, there's a nine-hour time difference, but he's a night owl, so I would put the chances at about 50/50.</p><p end="609" is_meta="false" speaker="Daniel Ellsberg" start="543">Well, it's a pretty good demonstration of the absurdity of the classification system.</p><p end="609" is_meta="false" speaker="Daniel Ellsberg" start="543">Probably 98 percent of what is now classified -- and we're talking about billions of pages here, that is more than two or three years old, should not still bear a classification --</p><p end="609" is_meta="false" speaker="Daniel Ellsberg" start="543">Or let's say five years old.</p><p end="609" is_meta="false" speaker="Daniel Ellsberg" start="543">So they&#8217;re keeping it for 40 years is typical.</p><p end="841" is_meta="false" speaker="Ben Wizner" start="785">Thank you very much. It's a great honor to be able to share a table with a man I've admired all my life, in support of a man who I've come to admire tremendously over the last eight months. On June 7th of last year, following the publication of the first NSA stories in the Washington Post and the Guardian, but before Edward Snowden had revealed his identity to us, President Obama addressed the revelations. And he said, "I welcome this debate, and I think it is healthy for our democracy."</p><p end="903" is_meta="false" speaker="Ben Wizner" start="841">The president was right. This debate has been healthy for our democracy and for democracies around the world. In fact, it's the extraordinary global debate that Edward Snowden launched -- a debate about the threat that mass surveillance poses to free societies, about how surveillance technologies have outpaced democratic controls,</p><p end="903" is_meta="false" speaker="Ben Wizner" start="841">about whether the Internet will be an instrument of democratic liberation or authoritarian control -- that provides the best answer to tonight's debate. Edward Snowden is justified because he provided to journalists and through them to us information that we had a right to know and that we had a need to know. The government had not just concealed this information, it had lied to us about it. And the debate that we've had and that we're still having would not have happened any other way. Now, in those same June 7th remarks, President Obama also defended the government's surveillance practices. He said that those practices had been blessed and approved by all three branches of government: within the executive branch, by the courts, and by the Congress.</p><p end="966" is_meta="false" speaker="Ben Wizner" start="903">Now, in making that point, President Obama probably would have said that he was joining our opponents' table. I would respectfully submit that exactly the opposite is true. And why do I say that? I say it because the same oversight bodies that had blessed these activities in the dark have dramatically challenged them and changed course in the light. Now, all three branches of government are engaged in a historicreevaluation of the NSA's surveillance practices. And we're virtually certain to see the first new limits on intelligence surveillance since the 1970s. What a difference an informed public can make. In short, our traditional democratic oversight mechanisms failed miserably before Snowden's revelations. Now, they're doing their jobs. Let's begin with Congress. When the Guardian revealed that the NSA had been -- collected the phone records of every American on a daily basis, many members of Congress expressed shock -- even though that program was purportedly authorized by Section 215 of the Patriot Act.</p><p end="1026" is_meta="false" speaker="Ben Wizner" start="966">Now, there's been a lot of debate since then about whether Congress did or did not know, or what they knew or did not know. But does it really matter? Either way, this was a colossal failure of oversight. Either they knew and did nothing, or they didn't know what the NSA was doing in collecting all the Americans' information on a daily basis. Now, we're all familiar with Congress's most dramatic oversight failure. And this was in the notorious exchange between Senator Ron Wyden and Director of National Intelligence James Clapper. Wyden had asked, did the NSA collect any type of data on millions or hundreds of millions of Americans? Clapper's answer was, "No, sir." Now,</p><p end="1026" is_meta="false" speaker="Ben Wizner" start="966">this brazen falsehood is most often described as Clapper's lie to Congress, but that's not what it was. Wyden knew that Clapper was lying. Only we didn't know. And Congress lacked the courage to correct the record -- allowed us to be deceived by the Director of National Intelligence.</p><p end="1080" is_meta="false" speaker="Ben Wizner" start="1026">To me, that is the very definition of failed oversight. And Edward Snowden was watching. Now, what about our courts? The court that had blessed the NSA's mass surveillance of Americans is a specialized court that meets in secret and hears only from the government. It was designed to grant warrants for foreign intelligence collection. It makes sense that such a court would hear only from the government. Over the last decade, it expanded its role to rule on the legality and constitutionality of programmatic surveillance. Judicial review of those programs amounted to a secret court upholding secret programs by secretly reinterpreting American -- federal laws. Now, when groups like the ACLU tried to challenge the NSA's activities in open federal courts, an interesting thing happened. The government didn't say to those courts that the programs were illegal. The government said that we had no right to be in court. And the courts exceeded to that demand.</p><p end="1143" is_meta="false" speaker="Ben Wizner" start="1080">The government's argument was, we couldn't prove that we had been surveilled.</p><p end="1143" is_meta="false" speaker="Ben Wizner" start="1080">Therefore, we had no standing to even raise these challenges. And in a 5 to 4 decision last year, the Supreme Court accepted that rationale and dismissed the case withouteven considering the legality of these programs. Edward Snowden was watching that too. Now, when critics say that Edward Snowden should have gone through the system,</p><p end="1143" is_meta="false" speaker="Ben Wizner" start="1080">that's the system they're talking about. Courts and a Congress that had abdicated their constitutional oversight role. Now, what's happened since Edward Snowden's act of conscience -- since he brought the public into this discussion? Well, two federal judges have now considered whether the NSA's mass collection of Americans' phone data is legal. One said it's almost certainly unconstitutional, almost Orwellian. Another disagreed, but the key point is that both of these judges heard the challenge. They both agreed that we had standing to challenge the program, which was a remarkable development in itself. Finally, these courts are doing their job and more challenges are on the way. What about Congress? A newly energized Congress has held dozens of oversight hearings -- public ones --</p><p end="1207" is_meta="false" speaker="Ben Wizner" start="1143">And is considering sweeping intelligence reforms that we haven't seen in nearly half a century -- to end bulk collection of Americans' phone records, to reform that secret FISA court so that it doesn't only hear from the government and others. Even the executive branch has undergone an extraordinary reevaluation of these programs. An NSA review panel appointed by the president -- which included very, very senior former intelligence officials -- the number two at the CIA -- concluded that the NSA had allowed its technological capabilities to dictate its surveillance practices, rather than ensuring that its practices conform to our laws and values. None of this would have happened without Edward Snowden. For that reason alone, he was justified.</p><p end="1683" is_meta="false" speaker="Daniel Ellsberg" start="1638">Thank you very much. Yes, I believe that Edward Snowden was fully justified in what he did.</p><p end="1755" is_meta="false" speaker="Daniel Ellsberg" start="1683">That does not cause me to support or make a judgment on any particular thing which has not yet been released or which has been released, exactly, but a question of whether he has served the public interest, on balance, in a way that could not have happened otherwise. I don't know the details that Ambassador, former DCI, James Woolsey, has told about. And I'm not sure how you know, actually, unless you are privy in a way that has not been announced here. I do know what has been released by the papers so far. Snowden, of course, has not released a single page by himself. He has explicitly said, over and over, that his own -- he doesn't trust his own bias in terms of transparency here. He wanted a judgment to be made of public interest by journalists that he trusted, and I think with right. And that is what has come out so far. I think that he was justified to the same degree, and in the same way, that I believe I was justified in releasing 4,000 or 7,000 pages of top secret documents 40 years ago, the Pentagon Papers.</p><p end="1805" is_meta="false" speaker="Daniel Ellsberg" start="1755">I believe that I had been mistaken earlier to keep silent about what I knew to be lies by my president, Lyndon Johnson, and later the president Richard Nixon, for whom I'd also worked, about what they were doing, what was happening, what the costs were, what the prospects were in Vietnam. I was concerned at that moment not so much about the Constitution, which had clearly been violated in terms of lying us into that war, but I was concerned at the people who were dying on both sides wrongly, I thought, by our escalations and by those lies.</p><p end="1805" is_meta="false" speaker="Daniel Ellsberg" start="1755">I'm saying that Snowden, I believe, did what needed to be done, what the public needed to know. I think there was no other way -- no better way and almost no other way -- for that information to get out; that it was worth, as he said, taking the utmost risks to his freedom and even his life.</p><p end="1865" is_meta="false" speaker="Daniel Ellsberg" start="1805">And, of course, we've heard exaltations, actually, by Mike Rogers of the House Intelligence Committee, the Homeland Security Committee, that he should be extralegally assassinated. Others have suggested by due process of law -- I give Ambassador Woolsey credit for talking about the need for due process here. But the fact is had I believed the motives that were described by the people, you know, at the beginning of the supposed opposition to Snowden, and we haven't heard that precisely from these two people yet, but -- or at all -- but if I'd believed that he had done this for some other country, for Russia, for China, to their benefit and -- or even to major benefit to them, outweighing any benefit to the public interest -- I would not be supporting him now. I believe firmly that Edward Snowden is no more a traitor than I am or that I was. And I'm not.</p><p end="1928" is_meta="false" speaker="Daniel Ellsberg" start="1865">I was called that by the president and the vice president at the time, 40 years ago -- 43 years ago. Many -- I was called every name that has been called, virtually, to Edward Snowden or for that matter to Chelsea Manning earlier. In terms of blood on hands, as to what would be the benefit -- the cost of this, none of that came out in my case, which is, I think, why I'm seen somewhat differently now, 40 years later. Nothing in Chelsea Manning's trial actually came out to justify the statement that people had died as a result of his revelations, and I think you should take with more than a grain of salt the descriptions right now that much worse will happen from Edward Snowden, revelations.</p><p end="1928" is_meta="false" speaker="Daniel Ellsberg" start="1865">The fact is that, I think, what he revealed was not just what NSA was doing, which I will make a premise -- I will stipulate -- was essentially with the knowledge of the president,</p><p end="1928" is_meta="false" speaker="Daniel Ellsberg" start="1865">at the orders of the president, desire of the president, and the knowledge of key figures in Congress.</p><p end="1989" is_meta="false" speaker="Daniel Ellsberg" start="1928">But, as Ben Wizner made the point, that to me reveals his greatest revelation, which is that the reforms that came in after earlier revelations of abuses by the FBI, CIA, NSA,</p><p end="1989" is_meta="false" speaker="Daniel Ellsberg" start="1928">and Army Intelligence, 40 years ago and 35 years ago, that led to the Church Committee and the current reforms, like the FISA Court and the intelligence committees, I think what Snowden has revealed is that those reforms, which were very necessary, failed.</p><p end="1989" is_meta="false" speaker="Daniel Ellsberg" start="1928">And they need to be not only redone, but better reforms are necessary, and I hope very much will result from what Snowden has revealed. As a matter of fact, I'll have mentioned already that Ambassador Woolsey has said that he thought there should be due process, there should be a trial for treason -- that's something I'd argue with --</p><p end="1989" is_meta="false" speaker="Daniel Ellsberg" start="1928">which implies that he thinks that Snowden adhered to an enemy of the United States --</p><p end="1989" is_meta="false" speaker="Daniel Ellsberg" start="1928">that's the definition in the Constitution, which I know he knows. I certainly disagree with him on that, and I think there's -- that's absolutely wrong.</p><p end="2045" is_meta="false" speaker="Daniel Ellsberg" start="1989">But he believes then as a result he should get the maximum penalty for that, which is to be hanged by the neck till he is dead. Now, actually one American was hanged by the neck for giving secrets to Americans. Actually, he was the first American to be charged with giving secrets to Americans. I was the second, 200 years later. His name was Nathan Hale, and it was a name that used to be known to every American school child as I know, and I've found sadly that, that's not -- seems not to be the case today. And he was an American spy for George Washington during the American Revolution, hanged by the British, and the reason he was remembered during my growing up was for his words on the gallows: "I regret that I have but one life to give for my country." What country was that?</p><p end="2102" is_meta="false" speaker="Daniel Ellsberg" start="2045">Not the country of his birth, that was the colony of King George III, in which he was in rebellion, and was charged with treason essentially, of which he was essentially guilty to George III, like every other signer of the Declaration of Independence, five of whom, out of 56, were hanged as a result. But they pledged their lives, their fortunes, and their sacred honor, like Nathan Hale, to a country that did not yet exist in the world, a country of -- later to be, shortly to be -- of a constitution with separation of powers,</p><p end="2102" is_meta="false" speaker="Daniel Ellsberg" start="2045">independent branches with checks and balances against each other, and a country with a Bill of Rights. When Snowden said there were things worth dying for, I agree with him.</p><p end="2102" is_meta="false" speaker="Daniel Ellsberg" start="2045">That's the mood in which I gave the Pentagon Papers, and I think he was right to do what he did to defend and protect the Constitution of the United States.</p><p end="2828" is_meta="false" speaker="Ben Wizner" start="2769">Well, I've been following this issue very closely, to say the least, over the last ten years or more. I did not know until The Guardian published the document that the NSA,</p><p end="2828" is_meta="false" speaker="Ben Wizner" start="2769">which is a foreign intelligence agency, was, on a daily basis, collecting the phone records of almost every American. Someone else who didn't know, or says he didn't know is Republican representative Jim Sensenbrenner who was one of the principal authors of the Patriot Act, who says that he didn't know until this document was published that section 215 of the Patriot Act was being used in this way.</p><p end="2883" is_meta="false" speaker="Ben Wizner" start="2828">Whether, again, that's true or not isn't important to my argument. Either he did not know -- he certainly should have known. Either way, Congress didn't do anything about it. As soon as the public was read into this debate, we're now seeing open federal courts debate the constitutionality of this. One federal judge actually enjoined it and said it's almost certainly unconstitutional. And we're seeing Congress threaten not to reauthorize this unless the administration will agree to reforms.</p><p end="3066" is_meta="false" speaker="Daniel Ellsberg" start="3007">Let me move on something else --</p><p end="3066" is_meta="false" speaker="Daniel Ellsberg" start="3007">Okay.</p><p end="3066" is_meta="false" speaker="Daniel Ellsberg" start="3007">Okay, most of the material that I put out in the Pentagon Papers, 4,000 pages that I gave to the newspapers, an additional 3,000 that I gave only to the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, it so happens, so there's some I didn't put out, it's very clear, by the way,</p><p end="3066" is_meta="false" speaker="Daniel Ellsberg" start="3007">that Snowden had an enormous amount of information that he could have put out. He says, and hasn't been challenged, that he chose not to because he thought it was not in the public interest.</p><p end="3127" is_meta="false" speaker="Daniel Ellsberg" start="3066">And a lot of what he put out was for background to the press in looking at that, but he relied on their judgment as to what to put out. In terms of when you say there was a difference in my case, in the 4,000 or even the 7,000 pages, there was actually no evidence of clear cut domestic criminality or even international criminality. So if it was whistleblowing, and I would say it was, that's not a requirement. I thought it was reckless, deceptive, dangerous decision making, and I felt it was still going on. And,unfortunately, I did not have the documents to prove what I was saying at the time from oral testimony I got --</p><p end="3127" is_meta="false" speaker="Daniel Ellsberg" start="3066">Okay, right, let me address that. They revealed, of course, and it's the only way we know, that Clapper, director of National Intelligence, Clapper, gave a false statement to -</p><p end="3127" is_meta="false" speaker="Daniel Ellsberg" start="3066">- we know it from Snowden.</p><p end="3187" is_meta="false" speaker="Daniel Ellsberg" start="3127">Now, I do not believe, as Ben Wizner says, that actually he meant to deceive Congress. I don't believe he did deceive Congress. I believe that he, unchallenged by Congress,</p><p end="3187" is_meta="false" speaker="Daniel Ellsberg" start="3127">meant to deceive the public and did so effectively since Congress didn't challenge it. I just read a very interesting piece of background here by Mr. McCarthy which convinced me that Sensenbrenner is speaking very questionably when he denies that he knew or that his act covered that. That's the problem. Let me assume that Sensenbrenner is not telling the truth on this.</p><p end="3187" is_meta="false" speaker="Daniel Ellsberg" start="3127">I -- James Sensenbrenner who calls himself the "architect of the Patriot Act," although,</p><p end="3187" is_meta="false" speaker="Daniel Ellsberg" start="3127">again, Mr. McCarthy said that was quite misleading. The point here is that Congress has been willing to deceive the public along with the NSA and the president regularly here,</p><p end="3187" is_meta="false" speaker="Daniel Ellsberg" start="3127">and that's the problem, that Snowden revealed.</p><p end="3244" is_meta="false" speaker="Daniel Ellsberg" start="3187">And I want to make a specific point here that was raised earlier on this metadata. Why are we talking only about metadata entirely here? First of all, there's a lot of text messages that are not metadata, 200 million a day, that get brought up. But what makes us believe that we were not listening on a different program -- I don't mean listening, I mean collecting recording for later retrieval -- all the content of the emails and all the content of the audio of the telephone? And the answer is the president and the others keep saying, "We don't do it." Why should we believe them? Why would you believe [inaudible]?</p><p end="3244" is_meta="false" speaker="Daniel Ellsberg" start="3187">John Donvan:Okay, let's take the question to the other side. Andrew McCarthy, why should we believe them?</p><p end="3305" is_meta="false" speaker="Daniel Ellsberg" start="3244">But how did we hear that? We heard it from Snowden's documents that came out.</p><p end="3305" is_meta="false" speaker="Daniel Ellsberg" start="3244">We saw opinions of the FISA Court, the Federal Court had not been made public.</p><p end="3305" is_meta="false" speaker="Daniel Ellsberg" start="3244">Right.</p><p end="3305" is_meta="false" speaker="Daniel Ellsberg" start="3244">[inaudible] can actually say how many times, out of 13,000 requests for warrants, 11 had to be modified or refused.</p><p end="3305" is_meta="false" speaker="Daniel Ellsberg" start="3244">Oh, [inaudible].</p><p end="3305" is_meta="false" speaker="Daniel Ellsberg" start="3244">Andrew McCarthy:If you're talking about warrants that get turned down or warrants that have to be totally rewritten --</p><p end="3305" is_meta="false" speaker="Daniel Ellsberg" start="3244">Yeah, warrants that get turned down, turned down.</p><p end="3305" is_meta="true" speaker="Daniel Ellsberg" start="3244">affirmative</p><p end="3360" is_meta="false" speaker="Daniel Ellsberg" start="3305">But did they --</p><p end="3360" is_meta="false" speaker="Daniel Ellsberg" start="3305">Did they succeed?</p><p end="3360" is_meta="false" speaker="Daniel Ellsberg" start="3305">They are not [unintelligible] --</p><p end="3425" is_meta="false" speaker="Daniel Ellsberg" start="3360">Clapper --</p><p end="3425" is_meta="false" speaker="Daniel Ellsberg" start="3360">Clapper made a full statement.</p><p end="3608" is_meta="false" speaker="Daniel Ellsberg" start="3540">Okay. Fine. I'm glad to have a chance to address that. Actually, the president and others -- many others -- have spoken about -- there was a better way, the way it was done was sensational, more heat than light. There were better ways to do that. I think that's clearly wrong. I really whether the president is so misinformed about the situation as actually to believe that. There were four NSA high officials -- senior officials -- I'll name them: Kurt Wiebe, Ed Loomis, Bill Binney, and Thomas Drake, who have among them an average of 30 years in the NSA -- one is 28, another is 32 -- who left the NSA because it conflicted with their conscience eventually.</p><p end="3667" is_meta="false" speaker="Daniel Ellsberg" start="3608">They left it because it conflicted with the Constitution. They had tested the proposition -</p><p end="3667" is_meta="false" speaker="Daniel Ellsberg" start="3608">- that is, there are other ways to do it -- in every possible way. They had complained to their superiors that the then warrantless surveillance that was going on since 9/11 was unconstitutional, was a violation of the Fourth Amendment.</p><p end="3667" is_meta="false" speaker="Daniel Ellsberg" start="3608">The Fourth Amendment.</p><p end="3667" is_meta="false" speaker="Daniel Ellsberg" start="3608">Let me say -- let me say on that. Let me go a little further. It wasn't just unconstitutional. The warrant with surveillance I think was blatantly illegal and criminal actually --</p><p end="3667" is_meta="false" speaker="Daniel Ellsberg" start="3608">Well, I'm sorry, I do need to say --</p><p end="3667" is_meta="false" speaker="Daniel Ellsberg" start="3608">Yeah, okay.</p><p end="3667" is_meta="false" speaker="Daniel Ellsberg" start="3608">They did everything -- they went to their superiors, they went to the inspector generals and NSA and at the DIB. They went to congressional staff and asked to testify. They asked to testify in open court under oath.</p><p end="3728" is_meta="false" speaker="Daniel Ellsberg" start="3667">They got nowhere. Every one of them was subject wrongly to an FBI raid which took their computers without charging them ever with anything. Thomas Drake as a result,</p><p end="3728" is_meta="false" speaker="Daniel Ellsberg" start="3667">has got a spurious investigation and so forth. They have each said, in contrast -- without endorsing everything that Snowden has said -- they have said the path he used was the only way to do what they had tried to do, was to bring this to the attention of Congress and the public and that there was no other way to do it.</p><p end="3728" is_meta="false" speaker="Daniel Ellsberg" start="3667">We were talking in 2001 to 2006 about metadata. They were collecting -- Thomas Drake --</p><p end="3728" is_meta="false" speaker="Daniel Ellsberg" start="3667">Thomas Drake was saying at the time, within NSA, and has said since, they were collecting content. And he said it's a secret --</p><p end="3789" is_meta="false" speaker="Daniel Ellsberg" start="3728">We're not talking metadata.</p><p end="3789" is_meta="false" speaker="Daniel Ellsberg" start="3728">I can see why [unintelligible].</p><p end="3844" is_meta="false" speaker="Ben Wizner" start="3789">Yeah, he did. He certainly has told Barton Gellman of the Washington Post that he did complain regularly internally. But it's interesting that you think he should have gone to the same Congress that you say knew everything that he was going to report. Congress did know. He was supposed to tell -- Senator Wydenwas on the floor of the Senate with his hair on fire saying, "If only the public knew what I knew, they would be outraged,</p><p end="3844" is_meta="false" speaker="Ben Wizner" start="3789">they would be furious." Well, we didn't know because he didn't tell us. We only know it because Edward Snowden gave it to the press, and the press told us. Now the rules are changing.</p><p end="3844" is_meta="false" speaker="Ben Wizner" start="3789">Well, and how effective could it have been?</p><p end="3844" is_meta="false" speaker="Ben Wizner" start="3789">No, no.</p><p end="3903" is_meta="false" speaker="Ben Wizner" start="3844">No, I'm saying he did report his concerns to superiors.</p><p end="3962" is_meta="false" speaker="Daniel Ellsberg" start="3903">I can believe that Ambassador Woolsey is totally sincere in his description of that. Of course, he's not speaking as a whistleblower, and I wonder how many whistleblowers experience -- actual whistleblowers he has actually spoken to. I have, a great many; the government accountability project and many others.</p><p end="4026" is_meta="false" speaker="Daniel Ellsberg" start="3962">The experience of going to IGs is simply a way of being -- and to your superiors is a way of identifying yourself as a troublemaker who will be suspected of being a leaker if there is a leak. That's why the four NSA people who had not been a leak to the New York Times -- which in my opinion, they should have been and certainly would have been more effective, that's why they were raided by the FBI and the computers, because they identified themselves as somebody who already thought the system wasunconstitutional. Ambassador Woolsey, I thought by your own comment, if I understood you correctly -- and I'm interested that you work on Senate armed services committee and were a senior staffer on that. But I thought I heard you say there were four staffers. There were -- which sounds about right. And there were some others.</p><p end="4026" is_meta="false" speaker="Daniel Ellsberg" start="3962">And the idea, of course, that we're talking about effective oversight is absolutely ludicrous. Judges of the FISA court, several of them now, especially ones off and even some who are on, have said, what can we do to see whether any of our orders are implemented? We don't have technical experience. We don't have staff, we don't have budget. And essentially the same is true of these committees.</p><p end="4087" is_meta="false" speaker="Daniel Ellsberg" start="4026">And I want to make one last point here. Russell Tice -- well, first Thomas Drake has said -- the one I'm talking about -- has said the secret they're trying to hold onto desperately is to talk about metadata and not reveal how much content they are already recording.</p><p end="4087" is_meta="false" speaker="Daniel Ellsberg" start="4026">And Russell Tice has said, I, in the NSA, had phone records of Justice Alito, of journalists'</p><p end="4087" is_meta="false" speaker="Daniel Ellsberg" start="4026">sources, of Congress people, including Feinstein and her staff and a great deal of content. Now, maybe he's wrong -- maybe he's wrong, but he has asked to testify under oath to Congress. And not one committee has asked one of them to testify because they don't want to know.</p><p end="4087" is_meta="false" speaker="Daniel Ellsberg" start="4026">And you should have.</p><p end="4087" is_meta="false" speaker="Daniel Ellsberg" start="4026">Up to four. That's pretty good.</p><p end="4213" is_meta="false" speaker="Ben Wizner" start="4142">Well, that gives us another opportunity to clarify and to respond to one of Andy McCarthy's points.</p><p end="4213" is_meta="false" speaker="Ben Wizner" start="4142">Yes. The number of documents that Snowden has disclosed is zero. Snowden provided a great deal of material to journalists. He entrusted it to journalists, at The Guardian, at The Washington Post. It's since expanded to the New York Times and other newspapers. His instructions to those reporters were that they, in consultation with their own editors, using their own judgment of what was in the public interest, and inconsultation with the United States government, should publish what the public ought to know and should withhold what the public should not know.</p><p end="4262" is_meta="false" speaker="Ben Wizner" start="4213">My view is that the reporting until now has been extremely responsible. There has not been an article published that didn't give at least the government a chance to weigh in.</p><p end="4262" is_meta="false" speaker="Ben Wizner" start="4213">There have been redactions --</p><p end="4262" is_meta="false" speaker="Ben Wizner" start="4213">I mean, this is [inaudible]--</p><p end="4262" is_meta="false" speaker="Ben Wizner" start="4213">No. What I'm saying is there is a difference and a long tradition of having journalists compete with the security state over what should be secret and what should be public.</p><p end="4262" is_meta="false" speaker="Ben Wizner" start="4213">If you look at the last decade, what we would not have known without leaks and investigative journalists, we wouldn't have known about torture at Abu Ghraib, we wouldn't have known that the CIA had set up a network of secret prisons across Europe and the Middle East, we wouldn't have known that the NSA had engaged in warrantless wiretapping before this was legalized by Congress in 2008.</p><p end="4326" is_meta="false" speaker="Ben Wizner" start="4262">All of this we know because journalists engage in competition with government for what the public ought to know and what it shouldn't know. Now, what Snowden did was on a larger scale. He gave a large amount of information to journalists, and those journalists include journalists around the world. I think part of what he wanted us to understand is that this is not about demonizing the NSA. The threat of mass dragnet surveillance, of collecting information about all of us in case one of us comes under suspicion, is a threat to all free society.</p><p end="4326" is_meta="false" speaker="Ben Wizner" start="4262">We don't know the answer yet. We don't know what has still to be published. And it's possible that the most important revelation that Snowden provided to journalists has not yet been published. Do I think that the reporting so far has been in the public interest? I think so, profoundly.</p><p end="4383" is_meta="false" speaker="Ben Wizner" start="4326">No, no --</p><p end="4383" is_meta="false" speaker="Ben Wizner" start="4326">-- according to national security officials, not according to the press. The press, quoting unnamed national security officials, quoting classified reports, that information is as false as their testimony was to Congress --</p><p end="4383" is_meta="true" speaker="Ben Wizner" start="4326">talking simultaneously</p><p end="4446" is_meta="false" speaker="Daniel Ellsberg" start="4383">I'm sorry. The statement that NSA has lost those programs is as reliable as the statement by NSA that he's released 1.7 million documents. Snowden has said publicly and to me it so happens on encrypted line that, that's an absurd estimate and has no relation to the much, much, much lower amount that he released in terms of this. And the reason that does make a difference is that obviously 1.7 or one million or five -- half a million --</p><p end="4446" is_meta="false" speaker="Daniel Ellsberg" start="4383">-- can't be read by him. He learned from Manning to avoid the charge that he was releasing anything he had not read himself.</p><p end="4446" is_meta="false" speaker="Daniel Ellsberg" start="4383">No, no, no, it's not absurd. Maybe it happened. But to take at face value the statement that NSA has not been able to replace that, that it doesn't have substitutes, that it got --</p><p end="4446" is_meta="false" speaker="Daniel Ellsberg" start="4383">that it actually caused them harm [inaudible] --</p><p end="4446" is_meta="false" speaker="Daniel Ellsberg" start="4383">Fine, that's also part -- that's part of it.</p><p end="4446" is_meta="true" speaker="Daniel Ellsberg" start="4383">talking simultaneously</p><p end="4508" is_meta="false" speaker="Daniel Ellsberg" start="4446">What I'm saying is that this sort of thing can't be decided by you or me or by the press, it has to be decided by intelligence committees in a court that have an entirely different technical capability and backup and access -- technical access to NSA programs that does not exist now. And I've been trying to give one specific example of that, when Russell Tice has said numerous times and in public that he had evidence, personal knowledge, of targeting of every member of the Armed Service Committee, every member of the Intelligence Committee, including Feinstein, her staff, and home,</p><p end="4508" is_meta="false" speaker="Daniel Ellsberg" start="4446">prepared to testify that under oath -- when he said that he wanted to testify, NSA immediately sent him a letter, which I've seen, saying, "You are --" this is to the Armed Services Committee, your old committee -- and he said, "I want to testify to Armed Services." And they said, "We remind you of your oath under NSA, the Armed Services Committee --" and they didn't distinguish between staff and members -- "the Armed Services Committee is not cleared for that information."</p><p end="4561" is_meta="false" speaker="Daniel Ellsberg" start="4508">What? This is --</p><p end="4561" is_meta="false" speaker="Daniel Ellsberg" start="4508">-- this is oversight? This is an absolutely broken system.</p><p end="4561" is_meta="false" speaker="Daniel Ellsberg" start="4508">Isn't this off the record?</p><p end="4561" is_meta="true" speaker="Daniel Ellsberg" start="4508">laughter</p><p end="4629" is_meta="false" speaker="Daniel Ellsberg" start="4561">Well, the answer I've heard -- and it's a question of who you believe on this -- is that Snowden said that he had actually the knowledge of practically every clandestine office of NSA in the world, not only the knowledge, but he -- I mean, he hadn't just seen it, but he had the knowledge. He said he had no intention of releasing that or taking it with him to China or anywhere else that he took the classified information, because that would not be in the public interest. Now, should we believe him? Well, some say, "No, it's allgiven to China." First of all, I trust his judgment as to what the public ought to know or not know about NSA more than I trust the judgment of anybody who said, "None of this should be known to the public." I don't think their judgment is to be trusted at all. And I do trust -- subject to analysis. It's the Congress and the courts, and it's the four people in NSA -- plus Tice -- have all said it is essential that there be a group of technies, nerds,</p><p end="4629" is_meta="false" speaker="Daniel Ellsberg" start="4561">hacker types who have the technical knowledge, reporting with full access to NSA data,</p><p end="4629" is_meta="false" speaker="Daniel Ellsberg" start="4561">reporting to Congress and to the judiciary, and that's the only way we will get this system under constitutional control.</p><p end="4807" is_meta="false" speaker="Ben Wizner" start="4744">Can I respond to this briefly?</p><p end="4807" is_meta="false" speaker="Ben Wizner" start="4744">Yeah, because I think that we may be slightly on the wrong track here. Sometimes the scandal is something that is illegal that's going on, that people don't know about, that Congress doesn't know about. And what the proper channel is, to go to Congress and alert them -- sometimes the scandal is that a whole regime has been created in secretthat the system deems legal. And that's what we're talking about here. I believe that these programs were briefed to the committees. I believe that the intelligence committees routinely approved this and were briefed on this, that they were taken to General Alexander's lair, where he had Hollywood set designers design a captain's chair and had the doors whoosh open and close like on the deck of the Starship Enterprise --</p><p end="4807" is_meta="false" speaker="Ben Wizner" start="4744">this was in an article in Foreign Policy Magazine. I believe that they knew what was going on. So, a 29-year-old contractor calls up Congress and says, "Excuse me, I need to really tell you what you have wrongly approved in secret" -- no.</p><p end="4862" is_meta="false" speaker="Ben Wizner" start="4807">What was needed --</p><p end="4862" is_meta="true" speaker="Ben Wizner" start="4807">laughter</p><p end="4862" is_meta="false" speaker="Ben Wizner" start="4807">-- was for the public to know. And once the public knew, everything changed.</p><p end="4862" is_meta="true" speaker="Ben Wizner" start="4807">applause</p><p end="4925" is_meta="false" speaker="Ben Wizner" start="4862">Well, you know, again, I treat with great skepticism the claims that we're less safe. The Nixon administration, in trying to block the publication of the Pentagon Papers in the New York Times told the Supreme Court that their publication would cause great and irreparable harm to the security of the United States. Now, that was nonsense. And the lawyer who wrote that brief said so 15 years ago in an apologetic op ed in The Washington Post. I think he's claims of harm to national security don't age as well as whistleblowers who age very, very well.</p><p end="4925" is_meta="true" speaker="Ben Wizner" start="4862">laughter</p><p end="4925" is_meta="false" speaker="Ben Wizner" start="4862">But look, we're not just talking about protecting ourself from a threat of terrorism,</p><p end="4925" is_meta="false" speaker="Ben Wizner" start="4862">which, although severe, is not a common occurrence. We're talking about protecting our republic. And sometimes our republic is more threatened by what we don't know than by publication of things that also alert our enemies. That detention that we face in a democracy, but the cost of democracy is that our enemies have to hear this too. We have to strike the balance in the right way.</p><p end="4991" is_meta="false" speaker="Ben Wizner" start="4925">My view is that the balance was way tilted towards overclassification and secrecy before Edward Snowden.</p><p end="4991" is_meta="false" speaker="Ben Wizner" start="4925">Well, actually, I think with a long term effective, Snowden's revelations will make us safer in a critical respect. They will have an effect on the infrastructure of our communications, that -- one of the effects is that we will begin to prioritize defense,</p><p end="4991" is_meta="false" speaker="Ben Wizner" start="4925">securing our communications over offense, manufacturing vulnerabilities in order to facilitate surveillance, this is a tension that exists within the NSA right now. I think that the spies have won out over the cyber defenders. And I think that it's in all our best --</p><p end="4991" is_meta="false" speaker="Ben Wizner" start="4925">all of our best interests to put more of our resources into defending the security of our communications rather than being sure that we can listen to every conversation in the world.</p><p end="5226" is_meta="false" speaker="Ben Wizner" start="5168">I'm saying he's not in control of what's being published.</p><p end="5226" is_meta="false" speaker="Ben Wizner" start="5168">Well, that's actually what most leakers do.</p><p end="5226" is_meta="false" speaker="Daniel Ellsberg" start="5168">I'm sorry, the point here has been -- again, I'm surprised didn't make -- it's not just that he gave it to journalists for their judgment, I think passed over very quickly here. The Guardian and The Washington Post have both said that they have checked every article that they put out with NSA.</p><p end="5293" is_meta="false" speaker="Daniel Ellsberg" start="5226">Some would disagree with their doing that, but they have done it, precisely to avoid danger of the sources and methods that you're describing of causing definite harm.</p><p end="5293" is_meta="false" speaker="Daniel Ellsberg" start="5226">Congressman Wyden -- senator.</p><p end="5293" is_meta="false" speaker="Daniel Ellsberg" start="5226">Senator Wyden and Senator Udall in fact felt that it was outrageous, that it was shocking to the American people if they knew that, if they knew this stuff, and it was probably unconstitutional. This is part of the intelligence committee. They knew that Clapper was lying when he said that. They could not put it out, supposedly, because the rule of the committee was to keep that secret. I would say they made a very poor judgment there. I'm critical of them. Obviously I'm on their side on many aspects of this. But I think they were not justified in choosing to stay in the committee, the price of which was to keep that secret from the American public that they thought should be public in order to keep that -- to cooperate in keeping that secret.</p><p end="5350" is_meta="false" speaker="Daniel Ellsberg" start="5293">The fact is that keeping your mouth shut -- and we are talking here about communications intelligence matters here, which were covered by 798. I had clearance for that at the time. I did not put out anything. I --</p><p end="5403" is_meta="false" speaker="Ben Wizner" start="5350">Okay.</p><p end="5403" is_meta="true" speaker="Ben Wizner" start="5350">laughter</p><p end="5403" is_meta="false" speaker="Ben Wizner" start="5350">I want to close with a few observations about the surveillance apparatus that Edward Snowden, through journalists has exposed. For much of our history, our privacy was protected as much by cost as by law. It was simply too expensive for governments to track most of us most of the time.</p><p end="5466" is_meta="false" speaker="Ben Wizner" start="5403">Now because of technology, for the first time in our history, it's technologically and feasibly possible, financially possible for governments to track all of us on a massive scale and to collect and store the majority of the world's communications. We now know that the NSA has built that capability and has used it in ways that are profoundly troubling to many of us. Polls show that 6 in 10 Americans think that the NSA's surveillance practices have gone too far. But Edward Snowden was even more concerned about what the NSA might do with these capabilities, say, in the aftermath of a traumatic terrorist attack. He believed that the weak protections that are in place right now were likely to be swept away and that our country's system would be replaced by one that looked very, very different. Now, whether and with what controls we should entrust our government with those kinds of enormous powers is a hugely consequential decision in a democracy.</p><p end="5529" is_meta="false" speaker="Ben Wizner" start="5466">We should have debated this issue before the NSA deployed a global dragnet surveillance apparatus. We didn't but it's not too late to debate it now and to impose strong democratic controls. Now, I began this debate by quoting President Obama, and I'm going to end in the same way. Just a few weeks ago he gave a speech in January about NSA surveillance and the reforms that he would be implementing and proposing.</p><p end="5529" is_meta="false" speaker="Ben Wizner" start="5466">And President Obama repeated his words from June. He said, "One thing I am certain of, this debate will make us stronger." The president of the United States believes that the debate Edward Snowden launched, a debate that no one can seriously argue would have taken place without him, has made our nation stronger.</p><p end="5529" is_meta="false" speaker="Ben Wizner" start="5466">I can't think of any stronger justification than that.</p><p end="5703" is_meta="false" speaker="Daniel Ellsberg" start="5647">Thank you, I --</p><p end="5703" is_meta="true" speaker="Daniel Ellsberg" start="5647">applause</p><p end="5703" is_meta="false" speaker="Daniel Ellsberg" start="5647">-- I agree with Ambassador Woolsey that, that was, as director of Central Intelligence, an appropriate way to behave, [unintelligible] convincing, and that the news editor was right, convinced by your argument, to change it.</p><p end="5768" is_meta="false" speaker="Daniel Ellsberg" start="5703">The Guardian and the Washington Post have both said that they have modified at the request of the NSA virtually every story that they have written on the basis of this. They did not accept all the objections, but that in every case they have done some. I think that's appropriate. On one question that's come up again and again here as to what might happen with this American NSA government, Congressional collection of potentially everything -- everything including content. Let's call it potential at this moment. In fact, I would ask Mr. McCarthy what he believes the collection storage agency for NSA data being built in Bluffdale Utah right now is for, if it is not for audio and video content. As Tice has said, it is in use right now -- and part of it. And all the digital data in the world -- that's e-mail, chat logs, credit logs, everything -- can be stored in a small room.</p><p end="5817" is_meta="false" speaker="Daniel Ellsberg" start="5768">This huge facility is being collected, he believes, for content. And I wonder if you believe otherwise. When it comes to 9/11, if anyone here in the audience -- or at this table --</p><p end="5817" is_meta="false" speaker="Daniel Ellsberg" start="5768">believes that Edward Snowden -- or any of us -- wants to increase the risk of another 9/11 or is indifferent to that, I think they are being very foolish. When it comes to having gone to Congress, I think he learned from the example -- specifically of the NSA four people that I've talked about, plus Tice -- that that would be a foolish thing to do. I must say that if you had asked me a year ago, when I believed these people as to what was being collected, whether there was any chance of reining this in and preserving our democracy, the separation of powers and everything -- with what was being collected, I would have been very pessimistic --</p><p end="5890" is_meta="false" speaker="Daniel Ellsberg" start="5817">-- Edward Snowden has made --</p><p end="5890" is_meta="false" speaker="Daniel Ellsberg" start="5817">Edward Snowden has given me hope. And the reaction to what he's done and the reaction of Congress and the public has given me hope. And I would say, when it comes --</p></transcript></debate>
