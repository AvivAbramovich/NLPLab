I think it was just sort of a combination of gratitude and fear.</p><p end="424" is_meta="false" speaker="James Dobbins" start="360">They were grateful that we just knocked off one of their two principal regional rivals,</p><p end="424" is_meta="false" speaker="James Dobbins" start="360">which was the Taliban, and they were fearful that they might be next. And so it was a combination. It was also a different Iranian government than the one we have today; it was a reformist regime operating within an environment that limited their powers but not limited to the point they couldn't reach out. It was a genuine opportunity that we flubbed. I'm not going to argue tonight that we still have that opportunity.</p><p end="424" is_meta="false" speaker="James Dobbins" start="360">Excuse me, I thought I was finished. Yes, Reuven Pedatzur.</p><p end="463" is_meta="false" speaker="Reuven Pedatzur" start="424">The same.</p><p end="536" is_meta="false" speaker="Shmuel Bar" start="463">Well, since I'm a historian, I've noticed that if during history everybody had acted according to the rational actor model, then most of what we know as history wouldn't have happened. Pearl Harbor wouldn't have happened. Barbarossa wouldn't have happened. Certainly Stalingrad wouldn't have happened. So apparently things happen which are not necessarily because it's in the interest of somebody to let it happen but because of other dynamics.</p><p end="598" is_meta="false" speaker="Jeffrey Goldberg" start="536">Well, I would say, first, that, you know, there are teams of neuroscientists in a bunker under the White House trying to figure out what's in Netanyahu's head. So it's a mystery to me too. I would say, to sum him up in a sentence, I would say that he has many manifestations of a typical, insincere politician. On the Iran question, I think he's actually sincere. What that means for policy, I don't know. But he is very sincerely gripped by this issue.</p><p end="652" is_meta="false" speaker="Jeffrey Goldberg" start="598">We're having difficulties in our relationship, yes, at the moment. At the moment.</p><p end="652" is_meta="false" speaker="Reuven Pedatzur" start="598">You know [unintelligible] Israel eye would like to know what's in Netanyahu's head.[laughter]</p><p end="782" is_meta="false" speaker="Reuven Pedatzur" start="718">Good evening. Where are the results? No results yet? Anyway, can Israel live with a nuclear Iran? The short answer is yes. Any questions?</p><p end="782" is_meta="false" speaker="Reuven Pedatzur" start="718">[laughter]Okay. But the real question is not this one. The real question, do we have another choice? And unfortunately, the answer is no. Because it's possible, despite all pressures and sanctions and even if there will be an Israeli military attack that in this decade, Iran will have nuclear weapons.</p><p end="850" is_meta="false" speaker="Reuven Pedatzur" start="782">So the question is for the Israeli policymakers, what then? What will be our policy in this case when Iran will have the weapons? Unfortunately there is -- as I said, there are no public debates on this, so we don't know what they think over there about future policy. What should Israel do when there will be a hostile Iran with nuclear weapons?</p><p end="850" is_meta="false" speaker="Reuven Pedatzur" start="782">The most effective and maybe the only way to deter Iran is to abandon our ambiguity,</p><p end="850" is_meta="false" speaker="Reuven Pedatzur" start="782">nuclear ambiguity and to move towards unconcealed nuclear deterrence. And since, in Israel, we have censorship, as you know, I have to play the game. And when I refer to Israeli nuclear deterrence, Israeli nuclear weapons, Israeli nuclear submarines with nuclear missiles, it's all according to foreign sources. I don't know anything. And I have to use this phrase, "according to foreign sources."</p><p end="910" is_meta="false" speaker="Reuven Pedatzur" start="850">But Israel has to change its policy and to move, as I say, to nuclear deterrence -- with new rules of the game. And the other side should know what are the rules of the game.</p><p end="910" is_meta="false" speaker="Reuven Pedatzur" start="850">There will be red lines so the Iranians will understand it. For example, if Israel will detect a ballistic missile launched in Iran going westerly, for Israel, it will be the nuclear missiles. And in this case, Israel will not wait to see whether it is a nuclear missile or not. Automatically Israel will launch its nuclear missiles, according to foreign sources,</p><p end="910" is_meta="false" speaker="Reuven Pedatzur" start="850">and it, Tehran-- [unintelligible], it's fine and so on and so on. And it should be clear for the other side what will happen.</p><p end="962" is_meta="false" speaker="Reuven Pedatzur" start="910">And then the Ayatollahs in Tehran will have to decide whether to launch their missiles when they know exactly what will happen. What will happen, that Iran will be destroyed, and we'll go back to the Middle Ages. And I don't see any Iranian national interests that justifies this cost. So I believe that we can deter them.</p><p end="962" is_meta="false" speaker="Reuven Pedatzur" start="910">I believe that the other team will use the argument of irrationality. We cannot deter these extremist Muslim Ayatollahs. And if this is the case, we cannot deter them, then Netanyahu is right, and we have to attack.</p><p end="1011" is_meta="false" speaker="Reuven Pedatzur" start="962">But I don't think this is the case, because if we have a very clear policy of nuclear deterrence, then the chances that the other side will use the weapons are very slim or not existent. For this, we'll have to change not just the policy. We have to show and declare our second-strike capability in order to show the Iranians what we have. And again, according to foreign sources, we have submarines, dolphin class with nuclear missiles. So we have second-strike capability, probably.</p><p end="1081" is_meta="false" speaker="Reuven Pedatzur" start="1011">So when they use the argument of irrationality, everybody goes to the Cold War and say the Ayatollahs are not like the leaders of the two super powers. They are not rational.</p><p end="1081" is_meta="false" speaker="Reuven Pedatzur" start="1011">They are not going to act like the Soviet leaders or the American leaders, which is wrong, I believe, because if you can remember, during the Cold War, Stalin was perceived, even in the states, as a madman -- whenever he has the bomb he is going to drop the bomb. And the Ayatollahs are not like this. And it seems from professional and sober analysis that the Iranians will -- if we'll learn their way of thinking, their culture, their history, they are going to act like real rational leaders.</p><p end="1141" is_meta="false" speaker="Reuven Pedatzur" start="1081">We should understand that the development of the Iranian nuclear weapons is not against Israel. It's based on their experience during the war, the Iran-Iraq war in the '80s, not against Israel. And it's very important to understand it, what is the base of their thinking about their nuclear program. And ironically, possession of nuclear weapons may moderate the Iranian leadership, exactly what happened with the Chinese leadership in '64 when they got their nuclear weapons, and they started acting like rational state. And another example is India and Pakistan. Only 23 seconds more.</p><p end="1194" is_meta="false" speaker="Reuven Pedatzur" start="1141">Really?</p><p end="1194" is_meta="false" speaker="Reuven Pedatzur" start="1141">So India and Pakistan, there were three wars, after they acquired their nuclear weapons in '98, about after a year there was the Kargil crisis, and they acted very rationally inorder not to deteriorate the situation in using the nuclear war.</p><p end="1194" is_meta="false" speaker="Reuven Pedatzur" start="1141">Thank you.</p><p end="1194" is_meta="true" speaker="Reuven Pedatzur" start="1141">applause</p><p end="1259" is_meta="false" speaker="Jeffrey Goldberg" start="1194">Thank you. Thank you. Thank you, John. Thank you to Intelligence Squared. Thank you for coming. Thank you, Reuven. I -- as someone who's covered Pakistan extensively, I'm not going to sit here and make believe that I would hold up Pakistan as a model of stability --</p><p end="1259" is_meta="true" speaker="Jeffrey Goldberg" start="1194">laughter</p><p end="1259" is_meta="false" speaker="Jeffrey Goldberg" start="1194">-- and rational nuclear deterrence, but we can talk about that later. Since you brought up this subject of the nature of the Iranian regime and what they believe and what they think and what they seek, let's talk about that for a minute. What do we have in -- right now in the world? It's a genuinely unprecedented situation, certainly unprecedented in the post-World War II international order. We have a member state of the United Nations, the Islamic Republic of Iran, that actively calls for the destruction of another member state of the United Nations. That is Israel. And they're very, very clear and consistent on this subject right from the beginning of the Islamic Republic. I'll give you a couple of examples.</p><p end="1323" is_meta="false" speaker="Jeffrey Goldberg" start="1259">This is from the supreme leader of Iran, who, as his title suggests, is the supreme leader -- he's the guy who sets the policy. Quote, this is from last February, "The Zionist regime is a true cancer tumor on this region that should be cut off, and it definitely will be cutoff." Its feelings are echoed regularly among the Iranian, and military, and intelligence elite. I'll give you another example. General Gholam Reza Jalali, the former commander of the Revolutionary Guard Corps, said last August, I quote, "The fact is, is that there is no other way but to stand firm and resist until Israel is destroyed." General Hassan Firouzbadi, the chief of staff of the Iranian armed forces, said last May, and I quote, "The Iranian nation is standing for its cause, which is the full annihilation of Israel." Finally,</p><p end="1323" is_meta="false" speaker="Jeffrey Goldberg" start="1259">Mohammad Hassan Rahimian [spelled phonetically], who is a top aide to Khamenei, said in the January 2010 television interview, quote, "We have manufactured missiles that allow us when necessary to replace Israel in its entirety with a big holocaust." Mr.</p><p end="1323" is_meta="false" speaker="Jeffrey Goldberg" start="1259">Rahimian is the deputy minister for subtlety on the part --</p><p end="1323" is_meta="true" speaker="Jeffrey Goldberg" start="1259">laughter</p><p end="1323" is_meta="false" speaker="Jeffrey Goldberg" start="1259">-- of the Iranian regime.</p><p end="1375" is_meta="false" speaker="Jeffrey Goldberg" start="1323">Iranian opposition to Israel's existence is not only ideological and rhetorical, we have to remember that in addition to actually calling for the destruction of the Jewish state, the Iranian regime works to destroy individual Jews. Hezbollah, the Lebanese terror group,</p><p end="1375" is_meta="false" speaker="Jeffrey Goldberg" start="1323">is a proxy of the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps. The rocket that it fires periodically into Israel are Iranian manufacture. The rockets that Hamas fires from Gaza very recently are Iranian rockets. Let's not forget in the last year you have multiple examples around the world of Iranians trying to kill Israelis, in Bulgaria, in Azerbaijan, in Georgia,</p><p end="1375" is_meta="false" speaker="Jeffrey Goldberg" start="1323">in Thailand. And let's not forget a fact I find very amazing, which is that the current defense minister of Iran is actually sought by international law enforcement authorities for direct complicity in the bombing of a Jewish community center in Argentina.</p><p end="1442" is_meta="false" speaker="Jeffrey Goldberg" start="1375">So you're dealing with a regime that regularly calls for the annihilation of the Jewish state. You're dealing with a regime that seeks to destroy and kill individual Jews, which begs the question, "What would be the impact on Middle East stability and on the safety of Israel if this regime which seeks their annihilation, states very plainly it seeks the annihilation of the Jewish state, were to gain a weapon that would help it actually bring about that annihilation?" And that's the question that we're dealing with today.</p><p end="1442" is_meta="false" speaker="Jeffrey Goldberg" start="1375">Now, there are three ways to sort of deal with this dilemma, I think. The first is to -- is to, sort of, say, yeah, you know, on the one hand it's true, the Iranian regime is the foremost sponsor of terrorism in the world and it denies the holocaust while calling for a new holocaust. And it executes people for being gay and it threatens Christian pastors with execution unless they convert to Islam. And it's responsible for a quarter of the American combat deaths in Iraq, and it hides many leaders of al-Qaeda within its borders.</p><p end="1511" is_meta="false" speaker="Jeffrey Goldberg" start="1442">But, on the other hand, no one's perfect --</p><p end="1511" is_meta="true" speaker="Jeffrey Goldberg" start="1442">laughter</p><p end="1511" is_meta="false" speaker="Jeffrey Goldberg" start="1442">-- and I'm sure that these, you know, gay-hanging, Christian-persecuting, American-</p><p end="1511" is_meta="false" speaker="Jeffrey Goldberg" start="1442">killing, Jew-hating mullahs, if they get hold of a bomb, will behave in a responsible,</p><p end="1511" is_meta="false" speaker="Jeffrey Goldberg" start="1442">rational, and enlightened way. The second response is what I call the, for lack of a better term, the "Uncle Morty response," because a lot of us have an uncle Morty sitting in Boca who spends all day on the internet trying to prove that Barack Obama is Osama bin Laden's third cousin by marriage. And the Uncle Morty response -- the Uncle Morty response is to say "You know, it's 1938 and the second holocaust is beginning next Tuesday and we're all done, and we're finished." The third response -- and this is what I want to get into during the course of this debate. The third response acknowledges a couple things. Is that it isn't 1938. The Jewish people do not stand defenseless and naked before the world. Iran, the day after it gets a bomb will probably not fire that single bomb at Israel, but it's also clear that Israel in a post-nuclear Iran Middle East is going to have a very, very hard time surviving.</p><p end="1563" is_meta="false" speaker="Jeffrey Goldberg" start="1511">Three quick reasons why it's going to have a hard time surviving: my colleague, Shmuel,</p><p end="1563" is_meta="false" speaker="Jeffrey Goldberg" start="1511">in a few minutes is going to talk about why the Cold War models of mutual deterrence don't really apply in this situation. I'm going to talk about reasons that it's going to be difficult for Israel to survive even if there is no nuclear propagation. The first is very clear to everyone, including President Obama. The day after there's going to be -- the day after Iran goes nuclear, there's going to be an arms race, a nuclear arms race, in the Middle East. President Obama has warned about this. He said very explicitly that a nuclear arms race in the world's most volatile region is inherently destabilizing. So you're dealing with, in a few years' time, the possibility that four or five different countries that all hate each other, are going to be pointing nuclear tipped missiles at each other. That's not a recipe for stability or happiness; it's certainly not a recipe for stability for the Jewish state.</p><p end="1628" is_meta="false" speaker="Jeffrey Goldberg" start="1563">Second reason: if you believe that Israel can only survive if it makes peace with its neighbors, then you will be opposed to the idea of Iran getting a nuclear bomb. Israel cannot survive in a Middle East in which America is a defeated and weakened ally.</p><p end="1628" is_meta="false" speaker="Jeffrey Goldberg" start="1563">America is Israel's most important ally. If Iran trumps America, if Iran beats America by getting a nuclear weapon, it means that the Arab states that were predisposed to makepeace with Israel -- and we know the peace process is [unintelligible]. Anyway, they will align with Iran, because Iran is the winner of that conflict.</p><p end="1628" is_meta="false" speaker="Jeffrey Goldberg" start="1563">The third and most obvious point is Hamas and Hezbollah, even now, periodically fire large numbers of rockets at Israeli civilians. Imagine the power that they will have when they can fire those rockets under the protection of the Iranian nuclear umbrella. Again,</p><p end="1628" is_meta="false" speaker="Jeffrey Goldberg" start="1563">there is a real chance that an Iranian nuclear weapon would lead to conflagration in the Middle East. Even without that conflagration, it becomes very, very hard to envision how Israel survives in the long term. Thank you very much.</p><p end="1734" is_meta="false" speaker="James Dobbins" start="1672">Well, just to remind us what we're debating about. The proposition is, can Israel live with a nuclear Iran, can Israel survive a nuclear Iran. The answer to that question is yes.</p><p end="1734" is_meta="false" speaker="James Dobbins" start="1672">You don't need to be absolutely certain it will survive. In fact, technically, you don't even think it has to be probable that it'll survive, just that it's possible that it will survive.</p><p end="1734" is_meta="false" speaker="James Dobbins" start="1672">And I think both of the opposition will acknowledge that it's possible it'll survive. And Jeff said that they'd have a hard time, which implicitly indicates that there's a good possibility they'd survive it, it'd just be harder. But -- so I mean, I think if you debate at that level, it's pretty clear. There's almost nobody who thinks that Israel's demise will be automatic and certain. It's a question of risk. And so I think in a sense, the real debate is, should Israel live with a nuclear Iran. And the answer is, not if they can help it, obviously. Nobody thinks a nuclear Iran is a good idea.</p><p end="1797" is_meta="false" speaker="James Dobbins" start="1734">And we're already doing a lot to try to prevent it. We have a massive probably unprecedented international sanctions regime, an active, if so far unproductive diplomatic process, a very active and somewhat successful covert sabotage effort andcyber attacks. Now, these may work in some combination. But I'd have to acknowledge that they may not.</p><p end="1797" is_meta="false" speaker="James Dobbins" start="1734">And so the remaining question is, should one of these fail, go to war to prevent Israel --</p><p end="1797" is_meta="false" speaker="James Dobbins" start="1734">prevent Iran from gaining a nuclear weapon. And I think although that's not precisely what we're debating, the issue does tend to revolve around that. Now, the threshold for saying yes that we should go to war to prevent Iran from gaining a nuclear weapon really has to go -- there are two thresholds, one is efficacy, and one is unintended consequences. You need to look at both.</p><p end="1862" is_meta="false" speaker="James Dobbins" start="1797">In terms of efficacy, I think most experts believe that an Israeli attack on Iran would set the program back by perhaps two years. That an American attack would be more effective and would set it back by maybe four or five years. It wouldn't prevent it, but it would slow it down. What about the unintended consequences? Well, most people are concerned about the possibility of counter attacks. Iran begins rocketing Israel -- Israeli nuclear facilities, terrorist attacks. But in many ways, the more dangerous response is,</p><p end="1862" is_meta="false" speaker="James Dobbins" start="1797">first of all, that an unprovoked attack on Iran validates their case for a nuclear weapon,</p><p end="1862" is_meta="false" speaker="James Dobbins" start="1797">for nuclear deterrence. North Korea doesn't suffer those kinds of attacks. Pakistan doesn't suffer those kinds of attacks. And many in the world and in Iran will come around to the view that maybe Iran actually needs a nuclear weapon.</p><p end="1912" is_meta="false" speaker="James Dobbins" start="1862">A second consequence is that you begin to collapse the international coalition that so far has made Iran a pariah state that has cut off its access to international markets,</p><p end="1912" is_meta="false" speaker="James Dobbins" start="1862">international -- not just nuclear technology, but any kind of military technology, and increasingly even cut back dramatically its oil sales. And as a result, Iran gains access to the world economy. It breaks out of its isolation. And even perhaps certainly gains access to sophisticated military technology. In the aftermath of an attack, wouldn't Russia be prepared to sell Iran the kind of air defense systems which so far it's refused to sell Iran and perhaps even nuclear technology from states like Pakistan or others,</p><p end="1912" is_meta="false" speaker="James Dobbins" start="1862">North Korea.</p><p end="1971" is_meta="false" speaker="James Dobbins" start="1912">I think in evaluating these consequences, one has to go back to the question of what is it that we, and for that matter, most Israelis, fear about Iran. And I think Jeff has pretty much answered that question. It's not Iranian invasion. It's Iranian subversion. It's Iran's capacity to appeal to militant elements within neighboring populations, dissident elements within neighboring populations in order to galvanize their efforts both against their own regimes in many cases and against Israel. So it's Iranian influence; it's Iranian capacity for subversion. It's not that Iran is going to march across two intervening statesand invade Israel. That is a concern. And the fear is that they would be emboldened,</p><p end="1971" is_meta="false" speaker="James Dobbins" start="1912">and they'd do more of this.</p><p end="2050" is_meta="false" speaker="James Dobbins" start="1971">But I think you have to ask yourself, which kind of Iran would have more influence with these dissident populations? Not with governments, but with dissident populations in places like Gaza and Lebanon and other Middle East states. An Iran that had nuclear weapons, or an Iran that was the victim of an unprovoked attack? Which of those two would give Iran greater influence and capacity to mobilize those kinds of populations? I think the answer to that is fairly clear. Now, the argument that Iran would be emboldened by possessing a nuclear weapon is certainly, I think, a real danger. But it's far from a certainty. It's not the historic pattern. You know, our major problems with the Soviet Union and particularly with China occurred before they had nuclear weapons.</p><p end="2050" is_meta="false" speaker="James Dobbins" start="1971">You know, Soviet Union gobbled up all of Eastern Europe before it had nuclear weapons.</p><p end="2050" is_meta="false" speaker="James Dobbins" start="1971">We had nuclear weapons, they didn't. China actually attacked the United States and Korea and made [unintelligible] a two-year war with the United States and Korea. They didn't have nuclear weapons; we did. Once they got nuclear weapons, we didn't have anymore wars. Now, we had lots of confrontations, but they were eventually defused.</p><p end="2093" is_meta="false" speaker="James Dobbins" start="2050">Both North Korea and Pakistan do behave irresponsibly on occasion, but there is a certain stability in their relations with India, Pakistan's relations with India, North Korea's relations with South Korea. There haven't been conflicts in either case. So the argument that they'd be emboldened to the point of actually threatening to use nuclear weapons or using nuclear weapons or even engaging in the kind of behavior that they're not engaging in now -- and I think if you listen to Jeff's list of all the things they're doing,</p><p end="2093" is_meta="false" speaker="James Dobbins" start="2050">you'd have to ask, what the hell else could they do that they're not already doing? And I think the answer is not much.</p><p end="2150" is_meta="false" speaker="Shmuel Bar" start="2093">Thank you. First of all, I won't go into the post-fact scenarios that were brought, but suffice to say that I could offer more optimistic scenarios. When you shuffle a deck of cards, then you play a completely new game. I recall that when we took out the Iraqi reactor we thought it would delay it for three years. But it took about 10 years, and the Iraqis did not get back to the level that they were before we took out the Osirak.</p><p end="2207" is_meta="false" speaker="Shmuel Bar" start="2150">Now, the arguments that have brought up the rational actor model, which I've already made some remarks as a historian about and the idea that deterrence works, and the other, the Cold War paradigm can be applied. I would argue that we have to look at both of these assumptions in a completely different manner. First of all, the rational actor model. Somebody, not me, McNamara, said that Castro was a rational man,</p><p end="2207" is_meta="false" speaker="Shmuel Bar" start="2150">Khrushchev was a rational man, Kennedy was a rational man. And three rational men almost brought their nations into utter destruction. And that was without any -- I mean,</p><p end="2207" is_meta="false" speaker="Shmuel Bar" start="2150">Che Guevara said that if Cuba had to be destroyed in order to destroy capitalism, then Cuba would be thankful for that. But in other words, rational people sometimes do things, or the dynamics between rational people, rational leaders, sometimes leads to things which are not rational.</p><p end="2266" is_meta="false" speaker="Shmuel Bar" start="2207">The other thing is that strategic surprises have happened. I don't think there's anybody here who would debate the fact that strategic surprises have happened. And when they happen, they happen because things that hordes of analysts and pundits and journalists have said are completely impossible because it is irrational that people will act that way,</p><p end="2266" is_meta="false" speaker="Shmuel Bar" start="2207">but they happened. So the fact is that these surprises happen, and they reflect dynamics which were not pure game theory rational behavior. Now, the other thing is that if nuclear weapons make countries more responsible, then I would propose that the United States, which wants to reduce its nuclear arsenal, should now just divvy out all of the American nuclear weapons to the whole world, and then everybody will become very responsible, very rational, and peace on earth and goodwill towards men.</p><p end="2329" is_meta="false" speaker="Shmuel Bar" start="2266">Now to the Cold War paradigm. The Cold War paradigm, let's define what it was. It was bilateral. It was a paradigm which, from a certain stage, had mutually assured destruction, with each party having a second-strike capability. It was with levels ofintelligence that when these -- both the United States and Soviet Union acquired that capability, the second-strike capability, they also had satellites in the sky, so they had a reasonable picture of what was going on in the silos of their respective enemies. There were mutual communications after Cuba, and there was also a perception of a taboo after Hiroshima.</p><p end="2329" is_meta="false" speaker="Shmuel Bar" start="2266">Now, when we're talking about a nuclear Iran, we have to understand we are talking about a poly-nuclear Middle East. The nuclear Shiite Iran is going to be perceived by the Sunni countries as something that cannot be countenanced, that they are going to have to acquire their own nuclear weapons.</p><p end="2387" is_meta="false" speaker="Shmuel Bar" start="2329">In a poly-nuclear Middle East where every country has a very small arsenal, they do not have mutually assured destruction. They have sort of arsenal which is "Use it or lose it.</p><p end="2387" is_meta="false" speaker="Shmuel Bar" start="2329">If we are attacked then we won't have a second chance. We are going to have multiple nuclear states with these small arsenals with very low levels of intelligence. They won't have satellite intelligence, a very clear picture of what the real intentions of their enemy are. The size of the arsenals, it's better to have a lot of bombs than a few bombs because then, of course, you have the propensity to say, "Well, if I don't use it now, I won't have a second chance."</p><p end="2387" is_meta="false" speaker="Shmuel Bar" start="2329">But then I want to go into something which has to do with command and control. And this is a very esoteric area. But in order to prevent unintentional use of nuclear weapons or use of nuclear weapons without total control over the process of what's called "escalation dominance," you have to have very sophisticated capabilities.</p><p end="2476" is_meta="false" speaker="Shmuel Bar" start="2387">When you look at the command and control structures in the various countries of the Middle East and the paradigms which existed in the Cold War countries, you actually discover that most of the key elements which were instrumental in preventing nuclear confrontation during the Cold War do not exist in the Middle East and cannot exist for various reasons, some of them because of the military culture, the political culture, et cetera, issues such as verification of authority, separation of authority over the delivery systems and the weapons, all of those things which made it more difficult suddenly to rush into nuclear confrontation, things like permissive action links which prevented unintentional use.</p><p end="2476" is_meta="false" speaker="Shmuel Bar" start="2387">So all put together, we are talking about a very volatile region. We're talking about a possibility that not because Khamenei gets up in the morning and says, "Oh, what a lovely day, isn't it a great day to drop a bomb?" but that because the Iranians do a nuclear alert, the Saudis don't know whether it's directed against them. Israel sees Saudi Arabia, and Iran, and Turkey on clear alert. Everybody goes on DEFCON, andthings get out of hand because none of these countries have the capability to control this spiral of escalation.</p><p end="2524" is_meta="false" speaker="Shmuel Bar" start="2476">Now we're talking about something which is -- even if we say it's low probability, but low probability, high consequence, and this is where we stand on that. In other words,</p><p end="2524" is_meta="false" speaker="Shmuel Bar" start="2476">we can say, "Oh, there's a 10 percent possibility that this will result in nuclear confrontation." Well, 10 percent probability of total destruction is something that you have to think about.</p><p end="2524" is_meta="false" speaker="Shmuel Bar" start="2476">So, putting all of that together, I think that I would agree with McNamara that rational actors or rational leaders do not guarantee complete rational processes. And as a final note, we also have to address the issue of the taboo of nuclear weapons.</p><p end="2569" is_meta="false" speaker="Shmuel Bar" start="2524">Religious experts in Iran and in the Sunni world all ask themselves, "What is a nuclear bomb?" Since there can be nothing which the prophet Muhammad didn't speak about,</p><p end="2569" is_meta="false" speaker="Shmuel Bar" start="2524">they have decided that a nuclear bomb is like a catapult, it's just a big catapult, because a catapult used to be thrown over the walls of a city and you didn't see who it killed so it's indiscriminate killing. Well, that's like a nuclear weapon. I think that somebody who sees a nuclear weapon like a catapult is --</p><p end="2756" is_meta="false" speaker="Jeffrey Goldberg" start="2697">Well, I -- first, I would say that there's only a limited amount of knowledge we can gain by analogizing the Chinese Communist Party of 1965 with the mullahs who rule the theocratic authoritative state of Iran in 2013. I really -- I don't want to stretch this to the breaking point, and I feel like that does stretch it to the breaking point. Yes, it's possible. It's possible that Iran will become suddenly a responsible party, but it is revolutionary in nature. I think by the time China reached nuclear status, it had been --</p><p end="2756" is_meta="false" speaker="Jeffrey Goldberg" start="2697">it was growing into something. Iran's specific goal is to export the Islamic revolution throughout the Muslim world; its specific goal is to destroy Israel; its specific role is to liberate Bahrain. A country that has all of these goals which gains a nuclear weapon is not going to suddenly say, "All right, now that we have the weapon that will finally allow us to do all of the things that we've been telling you we want to do, we're not going to do it."</p><p end="2837" is_meta="false" speaker="Reuven Pedatzur" start="2756">Iran is no China, I agree.</p><p end="2837" is_meta="false" speaker="Reuven Pedatzur" start="2756">Absolutely, but China is not alone. Let's talk about India, Pakistan. Let's see that South Korea lives under the ship of a North Korean nuclear umbrella. So it happens to every leadership that the --</p><p end="2837" is_meta="false" speaker="Reuven Pedatzur" start="2756">Because they know what is the price of using the weapons. There is no winning in nuclear war. So in this case, they know exactly what will happen and that makes them --</p><p end="2837" is_meta="false" speaker="Reuven Pedatzur" start="2756">And let me give you an example. We're talking about the Iranians, that they're irrational. Let's talk about Khomeini; he was very extremist, right? In 1980, when the war with Iran began, Iraq did, he said that he'll never sign a cease-fire agreement with Iraq until they surrendered. In '88, they started launching missiles, conventional missiles, in Tehran, thousands people dead. And he signed an agreement, because the price was too high. And we are talking about conventional missiles, not nuclear missiles.</p><p end="2870" is_meta="false" speaker="Jeffrey Goldberg" start="2837">Well, first of all, let me come back to Pakistan, because I've done a lot of reporting on Pakistan. Pakistan is moving away from minimal deterrence. We know that Pakistannow is mating its weapons and putting them on mobile launchers, so I would caution not use Pakistan as a great model.</p><p end="2870" is_meta="false" speaker="Reuven Pedatzur" start="2837">Kargil crisis, for example.</p><p end="2870" is_meta="false" speaker="Jeffrey Goldberg" start="2837">But let me just also say this. I think we're actually also talking about the wrong thing.</p><p end="2870" is_meta="false" speaker="Jeffrey Goldberg" start="2837">The thing that I worry about more than --</p><p end="2935" is_meta="false" speaker="Jeffrey Goldberg" start="2870">I am not avoiding the question.</p><p end="2935" is_meta="false" speaker="Jeffrey Goldberg" start="2870">No, no, but I'm not avoiding the question. I am going directly at the question by changing the question.</p><p end="2935" is_meta="true" speaker="Jeffrey Goldberg" start="2870">laughter</p><p end="2935" is_meta="false" speaker="Jeffrey Goldberg" start="2870">I don't --</p><p end="2935" is_meta="false" speaker="Jeffrey Goldberg" start="2870">Sure.</p><p end="2935" is_meta="false" speaker="Jeffrey Goldberg" start="2870">Sure, sure. Let me answer the question by saying I don't necessarily think that Ayatollah Khamenei is going to, one day, wake up and decide to launch a preemptive nuclear strike on Israel because he wants to destroy Israel. What I'm much more concerned about is accidental escalation leading to all-out nuclear war. Think of it this way -- think of it this way: what happened two months ago? Hamas fires rockets into Israel, Israelfires back, Hamas escalates, Israel then escalates. Imagine if Iran was in the picture with a nuclear weapon, right? Now, just imagine this: Imagine that Iran, in response to Israel's escalation, decides to move war heads closer to their missile launching sights.</p><p end="2935" is_meta="false" speaker="Jeffrey Goldberg" start="2870">And the American satellites see this. You'll be living in a Middle East of launch on warning. You'd be living in a situation in which the Israeli prime minister is going to say the Iranians are moving their missiles to strike us in defense of Hamas. What do I do?</p><p end="2991" is_meta="false" speaker="James Dobbins" start="2935">Well, I don't think the Israeli counterstrike is vulnerable. I mean, Israelis have nuclear weapons that can't be located, can't be destroyed.</p><p end="2991" is_meta="false" speaker="James Dobbins" start="2935">And so I think that launch on warning is not a necessary strategy for the Israelis. It might --</p><p end="2991" is_meta="false" speaker="Jeffrey Goldberg" start="2935">Can it wait till Tel Aviv is bombed and then launch against Iran?</p><p end="2991" is_meta="false" speaker="James Dobbins" start="2935">I think they would -- I mean, it would obviously depend on the circumstances. If they thought --</p><p end="2991" is_meta="false" speaker="Jeffrey Goldberg" start="2935">There's only three cities in Israel the size of Staten Island.</p><p end="2991" is_meta="false" speaker="James Dobbins" start="2935">You know, the United States was just as vulnerable as Israel. We had 24,000 nuclearweapons locked in on us. They would have damaged us just as badly as half a dozen on Israel. The result would have been the same. And it probably would have been worse for the rest of the world; indeed it would have been catastrophic for the world as a whole.</p><p end="3071" is_meta="false" speaker="James Dobbins" start="2991">And we lived with that for 40 years. And all of these problems with launch on warning --</p><p end="3071" is_meta="false" speaker="James Dobbins" start="2991">now, I quite take the fact that these regimes don't have the controlled mechanisms, the command and control or even the technologies that will make this a safer world. And so I fully acknowledge that there's an element of risk there. I fully acknowledge that Israel shouldn't live with a nuclear Iran if there's a better option. I'm just arguing that there may not be a better option.</p><p end="3071" is_meta="false" speaker="Shmuel Bar" start="2991">Yeah, well, first of all regarding rationalism and Khomeini. Khomeini, two years after the Iraqi invasion of Iran, he could have signed an agreement. He could have stopped the war, but he continued with the war. And the reason that he finally agreed to a ceasefire was because the revolutionary guards actually imposed it on him. The other thing is that Iran isn't like China which was going through a process when it acquired nuclear weapons. China was already moderating its revolutionary zeal. Iran is going through what we would call the second generation of the revolution. I mean, we're already in this sort of Robespierre style second generation of the Iranian revolution going back to the pure concepts of the revolution.</p><p end="3123" is_meta="false" speaker="Shmuel Bar" start="3071">Now, but that really isn't the real issue here. The real issue here, I think, is that analogies are absolutely irrelevant. You never walk into the same stream in the same place twice. And certainly when one stream is in China and the other is in the Middle East. Secondly, the dynamics of multilateral nuclear states is completely different to the dynamics of two main [unintelligible].</p><p end="3123" is_meta="false" speaker="Reuven Pedatzur" start="3071">Let me remind you, it was not bilateral. It was tri-lateral. China was [unintelligible] for '64.</p><p end="3123" is_meta="false" speaker="Shmuel Bar" start="3071">China never had the strategic capabilities of the Soviet Union, and the Chinese didn't have the missile capabilities at the time. And most of the Cold War was clearly a Warsaw Pact against NATO. It was clearly bilateral.</p><p end="3177" is_meta="false" speaker="Shmuel Bar" start="3123">So the fact that nominally you also have Britain and France, et cetera, and you have China, that did not make it multilateral. So it doesn't matter, though, because we're not talking -- and as a historian, I find it difficult to discuss analogies because we think that stories tend to think that God is in the details. And the details on the Middle East is that we will have a poly-nuclear Middle East where we will have a Sunni world which is going to see a Shiite nuclear power as an existential threat to the Sunni world. Anybody who's read the best seller in Saudi Arabia, "The Protocols of the Elders of Qom," which tells how the elders of Qom wanted to destroy Mecca and Medina, realize that they see this as existential as well. And so we have to understand that this is the situation. This situation does not auger well for stability.</p><p end="3248" is_meta="false" speaker="Reuven Pedatzur" start="3177">By the way, they&#8217;ve never threatened Israel with nuclear weapons, never. Never --</p><p end="3248" is_meta="false" speaker="Reuven Pedatzur" start="3177">never. You never find one --</p><p end="3248" is_meta="false" speaker="Reuven Pedatzur" start="3177">No, no, because --</p><p end="3248" is_meta="false" speaker="Reuven Pedatzur" start="3177">They don't admit that they are developing the weapons, so how can they threaten?</p><p end="3248" is_meta="false" speaker="Shmuel Bar" start="3177">[unintelligible] anybody who reads the materials coming out of media which is related to the Iranian Revolutionary Guard, I'm not even going back to Rafsanjani with his famous statement. But very senior Iranian people connected to Khamenei have madeallusions which could clearly be understood that way.</p><p end="3304" is_meta="false" speaker="Jeffrey Goldberg" start="3248">Excuse me. If the Ayatollah Khamenei's aide, Rahimian is saying that he's going to replace Israel with a big holocaust, I don't think they're putting pumpkins on the catapults. You know, I mean, I don't think you have to stretch it --</p><p end="3304" is_meta="false" speaker="Reuven Pedatzur" start="3248">So this is the rhetoric. This is the rhetoric for other reasons. They are not going --</p><p end="3304" is_meta="false" speaker="Reuven Pedatzur" start="3248">If they could do it, they would have done it. But they don't mean they are going to use the nuclear weapons in order to achieve this goal, no. No way.</p><p end="3304" is_meta="false" speaker="Shmuel Bar" start="3248">I beg to differ. I just -- --</p><p end="3304" is_meta="false" speaker="Shmuel Bar" start="3248">I think that one of the problems -- and this, I must say -- we as Israelis tend to believe people who say that they want to exterminate us. We have some very, very good historic precedence -- that somebody said they want to exterminate us and they tried to do it.</p><p end="3364" is_meta="false" speaker="Reuven Pedatzur" start="3304">So you --</p><p end="3364" is_meta="false" speaker="Shmuel Bar" start="3304">I don't believe in rhetoric. I think that rhetoric becomes action when it can become action.</p><p end="3364" is_meta="false" speaker="Reuven Pedatzur" start="3304">So you believe that the minute they'll have the weapons, they'll try to --</p><p end="3364" is_meta="false" speaker="Shmuel Bar" start="3304">No, I didn't say that.</p><p end="3364" is_meta="false" speaker="Reuven Pedatzur" start="3304">-- destroy Israel.</p><p end="3364" is_meta="false" speaker="Shmuel Bar" start="3304">No, I didn't say that.

It's not that the Israelis should go away. It's that Israel should go away and that a multi-ethnic state encompassing both Palestinians and Israelis should continue to exist. Interestingly enough, there are extremists, but viable parties in Israel who also think that the Israeli state should encompass all of the West Bank.</p><p end="3417" is_meta="false" speaker="James Dobbins" start="3364">The difference is that they think it should be a Jewish state, whereas the Iranians would argue it should be a multi-ethnic state.</p><p end="3476" is_meta="true" speaker="Shmuel Bar" start="3417">unintelligible</p><p end="3476" is_meta="false" speaker="Jeffrey Goldberg" start="3417">Just very briefly on that. What will happen was Israel's enemies realized that -- talking about pushing the Jews into the sea was not really a great PR strategy. So what they did was they changed the language, and they said, we don't want to push the Jews in the sea. We just want to get rid of Israel as a Jewish homeland and let everybody live there together. But then they also say, as the a toll laws say, all the Jews who aren't from there have to go back to where they're from, which leads to these incredible statements, and I heard this from many Iranian officials --</p><p end="3476" is_meta="false" speaker="Reuven Pedatzur" start="3417">[unintelligible] from.</p><p end="3476" is_meta="false" speaker="Jeffrey Goldberg" start="3417">The Jewish should go back.

I mean -- and it's a remote possibility that Israel could survive two or three or four years, but I really do believe --</p><p end="4014" is_meta="false" speaker="James Dobbins" start="3945">A remote possibility?</p><p end="4014" is_meta="false" speaker="Jeffrey Goldberg" start="3945">I really do believe that Iran getting a nuclear weapon -- and, by the way, it's not the Israelis who believe it, it's the U.S. that believes this.</p><p end="4014" is_meta="false" speaker="Jeffrey Goldberg" start="3945">I think -- look, I believe that every three to four -- let's say every three to four years,</p><p end="4014" is_meta="false" speaker="Jeffrey Goldberg" start="3945">there's another confrontation between Israel and one of Iran's proxies on its northern border or its southern border.</p><p end="4014" is_meta="false" speaker="Reuven Pedatzur" start="3945">But there's nothing to do --</p><p end="4014" is_meta="false" speaker="Jeffrey Goldberg" start="3945">Oh, I read the instruction sheet wrong?</p><p end="4014" is_meta="false" speaker="Jeffrey Goldberg" start="3945">Oh really?</p><p end="4014" is_meta="true" speaker="Jeffrey Goldberg" start="3945">laughter</p><p end="4014" is_meta="false" speaker="Jeffrey Goldberg" start="3945">No, I believe that -- I believe that it makes it -- that it makes it very, very --</p><p end="4014" is_meta="false" speaker="Jeffrey Goldberg" start="3945">Look, Israel -- why does Israel survive and thrive now?

It's not as if there's a gulf between the Israeli leadership and the leadership in Washington; they both agree that they should bomb Iran rather than allow it to have nuclear weapons, they just disagree about when.</p><p end="4250" is_meta="false" speaker="James Dobbins" start="4131">The United States had a peer competitor that had in many cases, more nuclear weapons than we did. People invested. We had huge immigration. People went to New York and Washington, and they knew that they were going to be exterminated if there was a war. They were right in the hair trigger, wherever else the bombs fell they were going to fall there. Did it stop building? Did it stop immigration?</p><p end="4250" is_meta="false" speaker="James Dobbins" start="4131">Why?

But I think it is absolutely ridiculous and absurd to compare a situation in which a country which has declared that it wants to exterminate the state of Israel, has nuclear weapons, as opposed to the balance which existed post Cuba between the United States and the Soviet Union, even though they both had nuclear weapons. It's -- you can make those analogies, but they have absolutely nothing to do with reality.</p><p end="4311" is_meta="false" speaker="Reuven Pedatzur" start="4250">But who is investing in a country when each -- there are 60,000 missiles aimed at?

The regime has done lots of outrageous things. But none of them threatened its existence. None of them threatened the continuity of the regime. Iran in fact hasn't invaded anybody for 500 years. So it's not as if they have territorial claims.</p><p end="4501" is_meta="false" speaker="James Dobbins" start="4433">They're promoting subversion. They're promoting overthrow of hostile regimes.</p><p end="4501" is_meta="false" speaker="James Dobbins" start="4433">They're engaging in terrorism. And I would anticipate that they would continue to do so. At no point has either American or Israeli nuclear weapons deterred them from that. I don't think there's any level of that that they could engage in that would result in a nuclear strike on our part. And therefore, I don't think that their having nuclear weapons would particularly affect that kind of behavior, which would -- we would continue to have to respond to forcefully at times and certainly rigorously. But I don't think it would be notably harder.</p><p end="4563" is_meta="false" speaker="James Dobbins" start="4501">And as far as Islam and the Arab world, or for that matter in the South Asian world, I don't know that it's particularly, you know, relevant to this problem. It's certainly a challenge.</p><p end="4563" is_meta="false" speaker="Jeffrey Goldberg" start="4501">Well, you know, to answer the question, the saving grace -- one of the saving graces of the Cold War was that the Soviets were atheists and that they didn't -- they didn't envision this world as simply the anteroom to a superior afterlife. And so I do think youhave to take into account -- not just with Islam, but with -- as I said before,</p><p end="4563" is_meta="false" speaker="Jeffrey Goldberg" start="4501">fundamentalist Jewish parties in Israel I wouldn't want to see controlling nuclear weapons. We're entering the age of political Islamism in the Middle East. The Muslim Brotherhood is in charge of Egypt today. In another year, it's going to be in charge of Syria. I'll answer this question with a question to the audience in a way, which is, would you be comfortable having the Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt be in control of nuclear weapons? Would you be comfortable having the Muslim Brotherhood in Syria be in charge of nuclear weapons? And for that matter, would you -- would you be happy if the chief rabbis of Israel had nuclear weapons?</p><p end="4608" is_meta="false" speaker="Reuven Pedatzur" start="4563">They have. They have.</p><p end="4608" is_meta="false" speaker="Jeffrey Goldberg" start="4563">I don't know. The chief rabbis of Israel do not have nuclear weapons.

The Iranian people, by the way, are not anti-</p><p end="4849" is_meta="false" speaker="Jeffrey Goldberg" start="4791">Semitic on the whole, but the regime most definitely is. I can cite you quote, afterquote, after quote to show you that they have -- they take almost an epidemiological --</p><p end="4849" is_meta="false" speaker="Jeffrey Goldberg" start="4791">they use epidemiological metaphors to talk about the curse of international Jewry. You know, these are not people who want compromise on the West Bank.

Iread what is written in Iran. I read the material coming out of the Iranian Revolutionary Guard.</p><p end="5038" is_meta="false" speaker="Shmuel Bar" start="4981">I have no doubt that most -- you know, Iran is probably the most pro-American country in the Middle East after Israel, but it doesn't really matter, because, you know, you may have noticed that not everywhere in the world does the public opinion of the people rule the country.</p><p end="5038" is_meta="true" speaker="Shmuel Bar" start="4981">laughter</p><p end="5038" is_meta="false" speaker="Shmuel Bar" start="4981">There are many, many countries in the world, not only North Korea and places like that,</p><p end="5038" is_meta="false" speaker="Shmuel Bar" start="4981">where people may think one thing and the regime is something else. And the more dictatorial the regime is, and the easier it is to make sure that what people want isn't what they get. The Iranian poet Saadi once wrote that the sultan is evil and you must get rid of him and you must destroy him, but if you cannot kill him -- you cannot cut off his hand, kiss it. And this is basically what has happened to the revolution in Iran. So --</p><p end="5038" is_meta="false" speaker="Shmuel Bar" start="4981">to the green revolution.</p><p end="5091" is_meta="false" speaker="Shmuel Bar" start="5038">Now, yes, it is possible that over a period of decades eventually Iran will get back to being, you know, a friend of America, a friend of everybody, and was a friend of Israel,</p><p end="5091" is_meta="false" speaker="Shmuel Bar" start="5038">was an ally of Israel. But what happens in between? And what does a regime do when it has a nuclear weapon and it does everything in order to enhance its position and to make sure that by enhancing its position abroad it can also put down its opposition at home, because who would dare intervene in Iran when Iran can do that sort of mischief abroad?</p><p end="5159" is_meta="false" speaker="Reuven Pedatzur" start="5091">Good question. But, to use their phrase, it's not relevant.</p><p end="5159" is_meta="false" speaker="Reuven Pedatzur" start="5091">It's not relevant to our debate what's going on in Syria.</p><p end="5159" is_meta="false" speaker="Reuven Pedatzur" start="5091">Sorry, sorry.</p><p end="5213" is_meta="false" speaker="James Dobbins" start="5159">I mean, I don't -- Iran is already --</p><p end="5213" is_meta="false" speaker="James Dobbins" start="5159">Iran is already helping the Assad regime. It would probably do so under those circumstances. I don't see why it would -- its help would be more efficacious because it had nuclear weapons. It's not going to threaten to use nuclear weapons against the Iranian opposition, so I don't think it's likely to have a major impact. It might have some short-term psychological impact, but it -- you know, I mean, the United States successfully waged a war that got -- that three the Soviet Union out of Afghanistan employing Pakistani and Afghan surrogates. The Soviets had nuclear weapons, they were completely useless. They got defeated in Afghanistan despite the fact that they had 24,000 nuclear weapons.</p><p end="5213" is_meta="false" speaker="James Dobbins" start="5159">It's not an analogy, it's history.</p><p end="5277" is_meta="false" speaker="Shmuel Bar" start="5213">The timeline is -- you know, time is out of [unintelligible].

We're talking about nation-states which have nuclear weapons and are posturing with nuclear weapons against each other and are going on nuclear alerts and are going into spirals of escalation. And this is what we're talking about; we're not talking about things like -- wars like the Soviets waged in Afghanistan. It's not relevant.</p><p end="5277" is_meta="false" speaker="James Dobbins" start="5213">Why is -- why is what the United States did to the Soviet Union in Afghanistan different from what Iran is doing to Israel in Gaza? Why is it different? It's exactly the same.</p><p end="5277" is_meta="false" speaker="James Dobbins" start="5213">You're supporting an insurgent pool against them --</p><p end="5277" is_meta="true" speaker="James Dobbins" start="5213">applause</p><p end="5277" is_meta="false" speaker="James Dobbins" start="5213">-- and nuclear weapons were irrelevant.</p><p end="5349" is_meta="false" speaker="Shmuel Bar" start="5277">But why is it relevant to this?</p><p end="5349" is_meta="false" speaker="James Dobbins" start="5277">It isn't relevant. That's the point. The nuclear --</p><p end="5349" is_meta="false" speaker="Shmuel Bar" start="5277">No, I mean --</p><p end="5349" is_meta="false" speaker="James Dobbins" start="5277">-- weapons had no effect in either case.</p><p end="5349" is_meta="false" speaker="Shmuel Bar" start="5277">Okay.</p><p end="5349" is_meta="false" speaker="Shmuel Bar" start="5277">Yeah. So the United States supported bin Laden in Afghanistan to help him kick out the Soviets, that was a very good idea, I think it was really a marvelous idea, I'm sure that you're happy with that, you know, in retrospect.</p><p end="5349" is_meta="false" speaker="James Dobbins" start="5277">Seemed like a good idea at the time.</p><p end="5349" is_meta="false" speaker="Shmuel Bar" start="5277">Yeah, especially in this city. But what we're talking about here is the risk of Iran acquiring a nuclear weapon against a series of countries, an array of countries which are going to have nuclear weapons as well, and not -- not the issue of how do you prevent a superpower with using limited conventional weaponry to invade a neighboring state,</p><p end="5349" is_meta="false" speaker="Shmuel Bar" start="5277">and then you use your own proxies against their proxies. It's a completely different game.</p><p end="5527" is_meta="false" speaker="James Dobbins" start="5460">Well, you know, I'm not sure that one can calculate exact levels of risk. I would certainly acknowledge that the risk of miscalculation and a nuclear exchange is higher if the countries have nuclear weapons than if they don't. It's high enough to be very concerned about. And so, going back to my proposition, Israel shouldn't have to live with a nuclear Iran if it has a better choice. I'm just arguing that there aren't better choices necessarily than those that we're already pursuing. I mean, I will get into whether it's relevant or not, but a whole literature on the concepts of deterrence, on means of deterrence, on mutual signaling, on avoiding escalatory instability by making sure that you weren't subject to a first strike, and thus tempting your adversary to make that first strike in rising tensions.</p><p end="5573" is_meta="false" speaker="James Dobbins" start="5527">There are ways that one can minimize the risk of escalation by the way one constructs and hides and disposes of one's nuclear forces. There are technical ways that one can avoid unauthorized use of these kinds of weapons. And there's a long history of literature on that. The United States, for instance, has sought to help Pakistan establish physical mechanisms and procedures that would make an unauthorized or accidental launch of a nuclear weapon more difficult. I'm not suggesting we necessarily get into such a relationship with Iran, but we might hope someone did.</p><p end="5699" is_meta="false" speaker="Jeffrey Goldberg" start="5619">Thank you, John. I want to just tell a very brief story. In 1998, I was in Afghanistan, in Kandahar when Osama Bin Laden issued his first fatwa, the first big fatwa, the fatwa against crusaders and Jews. And I was with a bunch of people, westerners, and we heard about this. And frankly, we laughed about it because it seemed crazy, absolutely insane, the audacity of it. And, you know, I learned three years later that very often when someone who says something that seems crazy, says it over and over again, that it's worth paying attention to.</p><p end="5699" is_meta="false" speaker="Jeffrey Goldberg" start="5619">And so on my visits to Iran, and I've been there a few times, I've talked to people in the regime about these subjects. I'll tell you one very brief encounter I had with a guy named Mohammed Ali Samadi who was a leader of a group called the Seekers of Martyrdom, which actually sounds like a great name for a band, actually. But their job at the time was to try to figure out how to kill Salman Rushdie. And -- but I talked to him about Israel. And he said the following, which has always stayed with me. There are always infections and diseases in man. In the world, there is an infection called international Jewry.</p><p end="5756" is_meta="false" speaker="Jeffrey Goldberg" start="5699">And I listened to him, and I listened to various leaders of the regime. And I have decided to take them seriously. I think in the post 9/11 age, we have to take religious fundamentalists who say they want to kill you seriously. I think it is possible to overlearn the lessons of Jewish history, to overlearn the lessons of the holocaust. But I'm even more afraid of underlearning the lessons of Jewish history. I believe that the Iranian regime is serious about wanting to find a way to destroy the state of Israel. I believe that if they get a nuclear weapon, they will go a great distance to achieving that goal. And therefore, I ask you to vote against this resolution, vote against this motion.</p><p end="5756" is_meta="false" speaker="Jeffrey Goldberg" start="5699">Thank you.</p><p end="5811" is_meta="false" speaker="Reuven Pedatzur" start="5756">Thank you, unfortunately, all the arguments that we have raised were irrelevant. So I tried. Anyway, I understand the arguments of the other side. It's very frightening to live under this shade of this hostile regime with nuclear weapons. I have no illusions. The Ayatollahs are not lovers of Zion. But they are very rational, and they want to survive,</p><p end="5811" is_meta="false" speaker="Reuven Pedatzur" start="5756">and they want to [unintelligible] their country. And at the end, they are not going to use the weapons. We can live with nuclear Iran. I live in Tel Aviv. This is the center of the target. And I didn't ask my four daughters and my grandchildren to leave Israel, because I believe that we can live in Israel and survive more than three years.</p><p end="5886" is_meta="false" speaker="Reuven Pedatzur" start="5811">In the '50s, at the end of the '50s when there was the threat of the Soviet Union, people in the States started building atomic shelters in their back yards. And Kennedy ran for president promising that he is going to build atomic shelters for the whole population. I hope that we are not going to start building atomic shelters in Tel Aviv. A nuclear Iran is not the end of Zionism. Thank you.</p><p end="5886" is_meta="false" speaker="Shmuel Bar" start="5811">Thank you. I want to just reiterate that rationality of every single individual involved in a conflict is not a guarantee that the conflict will end or will develop in a rational manner or in a way which everybody will be happy with. In the end, history shows us that a lot of things happened which everybody's sorry about, that it's bad for everybody.</p><p end="5931" is_meta="false" speaker="Shmuel Bar" start="5886">Now, you know, we talk about the Cuban Missile Crisis, et cetera. Actually, during the Cuban Missile Crisis, all of these rational people were very, very close to Armageddon,</p><p end="5931" is_meta="false" speaker="Shmuel Bar" start="5886">which was, according to the capabilities of that period. During the Cold War, there were a number of instances where the United States and the Soviet Union, with all of their command and control capabilities, with all of their intelligence, actually came to some very, very dangerous points, which were avoided because the leaderships had a means of communication.</p><p end="5997" is_meta="false" speaker="Shmuel Bar" start="5931">Now, the level of hostility in the Middle East does not augur well for direct communications between -- not even -- not only Israel-Iran, but Iran-Saudi Arabia, and we're talking about a Middle East in which countries are falling apart, and that some countries may acquire the nuclear weapons that they will inherit from the countries which are disintegrating. We're talking about a region which is -- I call this the "Humpty Dumpty stage," that they're falling apart and nobody would put them together again --</p><p end="5997" is_meta="false" speaker="Shmuel Bar" start="5931">this is a very dangerous area to have nuclear weapons. Ultimately, the question is not,</p><p end="5997" is_meta="false" speaker="Shmuel Bar" start="5931">"Well, can you do anything about it? If you can't do anything about it, live with it," but "You have to do something about it. You've got to find a way." And, believe me, there are more than one ways to skin a cat, even a Persian cat.</p><p end="5997" is_meta="true" speaker="Shmuel Bar" start="5931">laughter</p><p end="6065" is_meta="false" speaker="James Dobbins" start="5997">Well, I'm old enough to remember when in elementary school we were taught to hide under our desks under nuclear attack.</p><p end="6065" is_meta="false" speaker="Reuven Pedatzur" start="5997">Duck and cover.</p><p end="6065" is_meta="false" speaker="James Dobbins" start="5997">Duck and cover. And, you know, sirens would go off, and we would hide under our desks, so, you know, some level of fear and concern is natural enough in a society thatfaces that kind of threat. And if you can avoid the threat, by all means, do so if you have a better choice. We didn't have a better choice at the time. Reuven has suggested that a nuclear Iran will not be the end of the Jewish state. And I'd have to say most Israelis agree with him. The Times of Israel published a poll last week, a poll done in the context of their election campaign, in which they asked the Israeli populace what were the issues that most -- that created most anxiety, what were they most worried about. Was Iran the number one issue? No. Economic issues were their dominant concern. Was Iran the number two issue? No.</p><p end="6118" is_meta="false" speaker="James Dobbins" start="6065">Actually, and perhaps rather healthily, the deterioration in relations with the Palestinians was the number two concern. Was Iran the number three concern? No.</p><p end="6118" is_meta="false" speaker="James Dobbins" start="6065">The third concern was the state of their education system. Iran was the fourth in this list of six, with 12 percent of the Israeli population thinking that the Iranian threat was their principal concern.</p></transcript></debate>
