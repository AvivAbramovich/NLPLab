And they've been starting over the last month or two, and it's off to a really great start.</p><p end="480" is_meta="false" speaker="Peter Thiel" start="423">1989.</p><p end="538" is_meta="false" speaker="Peter Thiel" start="480">That is correct. I'm going to start with that fact, actually, but yes, that is very true.</p><p end="1021" is_meta="false" speaker="Henry Bienen" start="961">Thank you.</p><p end="1021" is_meta="false" speaker="Henry Bienen" start="961">Well, thank you all for being here, especially Mayor Emanuel. Thank you for coming.</p><p end="1021" is_meta="false" speaker="Henry Bienen" start="961">You gave a great speech this morning on the budget. This is an important debate. It&#8217;s about the American dream. It&#8217;s about social mobility and American democracy.</p><p end="1021" is_meta="false" speaker="Henry Bienen" start="961">Because the answer to the question as to whether too many kids go to college is fundamentally about what kind of a society we hope to create. I care deeply about this issue. I&#8217;m an educator, 28 years at Princeton, 14.5 years as Northwestern&#8217;s president,</p><p end="1021" is_meta="false" speaker="Henry Bienen" start="961">now chair of a proprietary for-profit college, Rasmussen College, and a member of the Board of Education, appointed by the mayor for the Chicago Public School System. Sure,</p><p end="1021" is_meta="false" speaker="Henry Bienen" start="961">some dropouts make it big.</p><p end="-1468281051" is_meta="false" speaker="Henry Bienen" start="1021">But social and economic policy should be informed by data and analysis, not anecdotal individual life histories, no matter how compelling. Most people are not Bill Gates or Steve Jobs. We should not misread particular circumstances at particular moments in time as an indication of likely long outcomes. As Damon Runyon once said, &#8220;The race is not always to the swift nor the battle to the strong, but that&#8217;s how the smart money bets.&#8221; The argument that too many people are going to college is not new. In his youth,</p><p end="-1468281051" is_meta="false" speaker="Henry Bienen" start="1021">Richard Freeman, a Harvard economist, argued this in &#8220;The Overeducated American&#8221; in 1976. He was wrong then, and our opponents are wrong now. And by the way, he&#8217;s changed his mind. We now have studies and lots of information. Mr. Rosenkranz alluded to some of them, which should persuade anyone with an open mind that more years of school, post-secondary, are positively correlated with earning over one&#8217;s lifetime, and also correlated with lower rates of unemployment and shorter duration being unemployed when a higher degree is not obtained.</p><p end="1144" is_meta="false" speaker="Henry Bienen" start="-1468281051">4.3 percent of college graduates are unemployed. More than triple that number of high school students or high school dropouts are unemployed. This is very compelling.</p><p end="1144" is_meta="false" speaker="Henry Bienen" start="-1468281051">There&#8217;s a clear wage premium to education. There&#8217;s also a social premium to society,</p><p end="1144" is_meta="false" speaker="Henry Bienen" start="-1468281051">not just individual. Society benefits through greater productivity, lower crime, better health, better citizenship for more educated people. And the wage premium to education has been growing since the 1980s, not shrinking. The question to be decided is whether it&#8217;s true that too many kids go to college. Fact: In 2010, about 66 percent of the United States population between 25 and 30 had some college experience. The rest were high school grads or high school dropouts. It&#8217;s hardly the case that everyone or too many are pouring into college.</p><p end="1202" is_meta="false" speaker="Henry Bienen" start="1144">We need more, not fewer, college graduates. Going to college in the United States, by the way, means very different things. From two-year community colleges, flagship public research universities, small denominational colleges, elite privates, and for-</p><p end="1202" is_meta="false" speaker="Henry Bienen" start="1144">profits. By the way, at the for-profits, the average age of the students is 28, and these are not kids. Many of them are single mothers. Many are minorities. They don&#8217;t choose to attend such a place for a liberal arts education or because we have great athletic teams or a climbing wall. They come to improve their careers, their income,</p><p end="1202" is_meta="false" speaker="Henry Bienen" start="1144">their life chances, and they do. In his articles, Mr. Murray argues that too many people are going to college, and I feel he believes in innate qualities. He uses a language like,</p><p end="1202" is_meta="false" speaker="Henry Bienen" start="1144">&#8220;He does not have it in him.&#8221; But how does he know this? What measures does he have for a great understanding of cognitive abilities or their impact? He believes, I think, that abilities are fixed.</p><p end="1267" is_meta="false" speaker="Henry Bienen" start="1202">It&#8217;s a highly stratified view of the world and people&#8217;s places in it, and I don&#8217;t share it.</p><p end="1267" is_meta="false" speaker="Henry Bienen" start="1202">True, plenty of people who graduate high school are not college ready. We know this in Chicago. But low college graduation rates and dropout cannot be attributed everywhere and completely to individual's intelligence or competence. Even some qualified students in high school may not attain to a four-year degree within six to eight years because of their lack of resources which compels them to leave and drop out. No doubt, some people don't have the smarts or the personality skills to succeed. But for many, their environment at pre-college school systems have played a big role in not preparing them. We should not be so ready to consign them to what Mr. Murray may feel is their fate. Neither they nor our society will benefit from pushing them into what,</p><p end="1267" is_meta="false" speaker="Henry Bienen" start="1202">for many will be low-level jobs. Because for every college degree holder who is a janitor or a waitress, there are thousands of times janitors and waitresses who are high school dropouts.</p><p end="1322" is_meta="false" speaker="Henry Bienen" start="1267">Mr. Thiel has acknowledged a correlation in his own writings between college attendance and higher income. But he doubts the direction of causation. That is,</p><p end="1322" is_meta="false" speaker="Henry Bienen" start="1267">college may pay off for some people because smarter people go to it. In my view,</p><p end="1322" is_meta="false" speaker="Henry Bienen" start="1267">whatever the direction of causation, you can learn skills at college and improve your life chances. And by the way, we have lots of studies, including studies of twins that Allen Kruger and others have done which shows you can isolate the college experience itself among all the other variables which count. And college does make a difference. Now,</p><p end="1322" is_meta="false" speaker="Henry Bienen" start="1267">high school vocational alternatives are there, but they're not widely regarded as --</p><p end="1322" is_meta="false" speaker="Henry Bienen" start="1267">they're widely regarded as second best by the general public. Polls show that most Americans agree that everyone does not need to go to college. They support alternatives for other people's children. I wonder if those in favor of the proposition want their own children or relatives to not go to college.</p><p end="1385" is_meta="false" speaker="Henry Bienen" start="1322">Mr. Thiel, Mr. Murray, I know Mr. Thiel has started this fund, and I applaud his generosity. It is very generous. Will he fund tens of thousands, millions? All the trend lines show a shift in the U.S. economy and its labor force towards more people requiring post secondary education because growth industries require post secondary education.</p><p end="1385" is_meta="false" speaker="Henry Bienen" start="1322">We've hollowed out industrial jobs. The clear way to premium for college graduates is growing. It skyrocketed in the 1980s and 1990s. Advanced degree holders did vastly better, and their advantage continues to hold up. And by the way, for women, that wage premium is even higher than for men. I need to conclude, but I want to conclude by saying there are not many alternatives in the U.S. We don't have a vocational system like Switzerland or Germany. I'm not against building such a vocational system. I'd like to see more tracks that people can go to. But what we really need to do is do better in pre-K through 12.</p><p end="1444" is_meta="false" speaker="Henry Bienen" start="1385">We cannot accept that too many kids go to college. In summary, those who go beyond secondary school are -- not all kids. There are not too many of them. I'm not willing to consign them to low-level jobs. We need to do better, and we can't give up on the American dream. Thank you.</p><p end="1444" is_meta="false" speaker="Charles Murray" start="1385">That's what I thought at the time.</p><p end="1502" is_meta="false" speaker="Charles Murray" start="1444">Oh, I now recommend that we abolish the SAT, because it turns out that if they give an achievement test, I probably would have gotten into Harvard that way too. And the SAT, as it now exists, has taken on a really bad number.</p><p end="1502" is_meta="false" speaker="Charles Murray" start="1444">I think we better get the topic straight. When I agreed to debate on too many kids are going to college, I thought of college as being four-year colleges leading to the BA. I didn't think of it as a whole range of community colleges and the rest.</p><p end="1561" is_meta="false" speaker="Charles Murray" start="1502">Anyway, that's the way I'm going to argue tonight because if the proposition were that too many kids are trying to get more education and training after high school, I wouldn't have accepted the position on the affirmative. Almost everybody needs more education after high school. What they don't need is to chase after this fraudulent, destructive,antediluvian thing called a BA. The thesis of my argument really is that the BA is the work of the devil.</p><p end="1561" is_meta="true" speaker="Charles Murray" start="1502">laughter</p><p end="1561" is_meta="false" speaker="Charles Murray" start="1502">Let's go through each of those accusations. First, fraudulent. The BA is supposed to signify, in a very old-fashioned term, that you are an educated man, now -- an educated person. You know and I know that it doesn't represent that any more. The number of colleges that require the core courses that's go into a liberal education is virtually not --</p><p end="1561" is_meta="false" speaker="Charles Murray" start="1502">don't exist. But it's much worse than that.</p><p end="1627" is_meta="false" speaker="Charles Murray" start="1561">If the only thing you know about a person is that that person has a BA, you don't know anything. If that seems too extreme, I can document all kinds of stories about courses in introductory economics which use magazine articles as the text about students who get a BA after four years without having to write a single solitary term paper, about exam scores which, by any traditional grading system means a D or an F. But guess what?</p><p end="1627" is_meta="false" speaker="Charles Murray" start="1561">They're transmuted into Bs. And why are they transmuted into Bs? Because the story they want -- have now is retention, whereby the point of a college is to bring in as much tuition money as you can. And you've got to retain kids. And in fact, if they want to drop out of courses and stay for five or six years instead of four, that's just fine with the college. You can talk to employers all over the country who will tell you about applicants who have BAs, who can't write grammatical sentences in their applications and sometimes can't read very well.</p><p end="1681" is_meta="false" speaker="Charles Murray" start="1627">All of these things do not refer to the products of a few diploma mills. I am talking about large chunks of the second tier and third tier state college and university systems.</p><p end="1681" is_meta="false" speaker="Charles Murray" start="1627">And I'm also talking about large numbers of courses and students in the first tier system and a whole lot of very expensive elite colleges. Knowing what major a person had doesn't tell you very much. Yeah, if it's math, if it's hard sciences, if it's engineering,</p><p end="1681" is_meta="false" speaker="Charles Murray" start="1627">okay. But what does it mean if you have a political science degree, spoken by a person who has a political science degree, if you're going to an employer and saying you ought to hire me. It doesn't really mean anything. Now, here is what you do know about a person with a BA if you know what school they came from. So if the applicant came from Harvard, you know a whole lot about what person was like at age 18 before he went to college.</p><p end="1748" is_meta="false" speaker="Charles Murray" start="1681">You know he had terrific SAT scores, and you know he had a terrific high school record or he wouldn't have gotten in. You don't know anything about what Harvard has added.And as a graduate of that institution, trust me, I am living proof of that statement in a whole bunch of ways. None of this should be news to any of you. The retreat of the academy from rigorous education is known to everybody who's in higher education.</p><p end="1748" is_meta="false" speaker="Charles Murray" start="1681">Except for majors in engineering and math and the hard sciences which account for just 12 percent of undergraduates, the bachelor's degree, all by itself, is meaningless. Okay,</p><p end="1748" is_meta="false" speaker="Charles Murray" start="1681">destructive. Even though we know that the BA is substantively meaningless, it remains true that for millions of jobs you can't get a job interview unless you have one. And the problem is that employers are behaving rationally when they do that because you've got about 32 percent of adults that have a BA. The employers know how clueless many of them are. Why should they go outside that pool and take even lower levels of population in terms of their ability.</p><p end="1805" is_meta="false" speaker="Charles Murray" start="1748">So they're being rational. But the problem is this: We have created a kind of self-</p><p end="1805" is_meta="false" speaker="Charles Murray" start="1748">fulfilling prophecy. We have created a culture in which not having a BA labels you, in the minds of way too many people, as being either dumb or lazy. And so a lot of ambitious kids who have no interest in sitting in classrooms for four years and accumulating these large student loan debts, nonetheless want the piece of paper. It is not surprising that we have all the horror stories which are documented in journal articles and large surveys, not anecdotally, of kids who take the easiest possible classes and don't study. They aren't there to get an education. They're there to get a piece of paper. It is hugely destructive to have created this kind of false credential. It is destructive to the majority of young people who don't try to go to college because they know college is not for them.</p><p end="1861" is_meta="false" speaker="Charles Murray" start="1805">It is destructive for about 40 percent of those who start college who never finish. But most of all it is destructive to America's civic culture. We have always prided ourselves upon the idea that everybody is equal in all the ways that count with regard to human dignity. We have given a meaningless educational credential a role in our culture that says otherwise. Antediluvian. I have time just to state the proposition and hope to have a chance to elaborate later, the four-year brick and mortar college is obsolete. Four years is almost always too long. There's hardly any profession that requires four years of class work. A lot of them require an apprenticeship much longer than that. The rationale for a big physical plant at a residential college is just vanishing. What's the rationale for having a library these days? It used to be central.</p><p end="1922" is_meta="false" speaker="Charles Murray" start="1861">Why should it be that the brilliant professor giving a lecture where he doesn't take any individual relationships with students but just giving a superb lecture, why is he giving that lecture to 150 kids who happen to be sitting in the hall, why isn't it being given tomillions? Distance education has all sorts of possibilities it didn't have before. The information revolution is giving us a cornucopia of new ways to help kids get an education. Well, that just begins to say what I want to say but what I'm really coming down to is nobody should go to college as the system is now defined. What we need is a transformation that gives young people a chance to tell employers or for that matter to tell graduate admissions officers what they know and what they can do, not where they learned it and how long it took them. Thank you.</p><p end="1978" is_meta="true" speaker="Vivek Wadhwa" start="1922">unintelligible</p><p end="1978" is_meta="false" speaker="Vivek Wadhwa" start="1922">And Berkeley.</p><p end="1978" is_meta="false" speaker="Vivek Wadhwa" start="1922">John, I call myself a tech guy lost in academia.</p><p end="1978" is_meta="false" speaker="Vivek Wadhwa" start="1922">You know --</p><p end="1978" is_meta="true" speaker="Vivek Wadhwa" start="1922">applause</p><p end="1978" is_meta="false" speaker="Vivek Wadhwa" start="1922">-- it must be because I'm an immigrant, I'm a tech entrepreneur, I'm a foreign [unintelligible], that I have a totally different perspective on this whole debate. In fact,</p><p end="1978" is_meta="false" speaker="Vivek Wadhwa" start="1922">when I first stepped into it, it was ripping Peter Thiel's head off in an article I wrote for telling kids to drop out of college because it didn't make sense to me. You know, as an academic for the last six or seven years I've been researching what's happening globally.</p><p end="1978" is_meta="false" speaker="Vivek Wadhwa" start="1922">I've been researching the impact of globalization on U.S. competitiveness.</p><p end="2042" is_meta="false" speaker="Vivek Wadhwa" start="1978">I've been researching American schools versus other schools, and so on, and what makes America what it is, you know our competitiveness, immigration, and so on, those topics I've been researching. And when I step back from that, my conclusion is that these people in America are totally completely out of touch. If you read my writings,</p><p end="2042" is_meta="false" speaker="Vivek Wadhwa" start="1978">you'll see that I've been writing very controversial articles, each of them rip into a different aspect of American competitiveness because we don't get it. We're sitting here in our own little bubble disconnected from the rest of the world. Now, let -- I'm going to give you three perspectives on this. First of all, about U.S. education itself,</p><p end="2042" is_meta="false" speaker="Vivek Wadhwa" start="1978">believe it or not, U.S. education is by far the best in the world. Everyone is trying to be like us. This is -- you know, I mean, people from abroad stake their life savings, you know, all the money they can possibly raise and invest it in sending their kids to America because we've got the best schools. What do gain [spelled phonetically] from our schools? It's not the courses. It's really the knowledge. It's how to learn. You gain social skills. You learn how to interact with other people.</p><p end="2104" is_meta="false" speaker="Vivek Wadhwa" start="2042">You learn how to deal with failure, make compromises. You learn how to solve problems. These are sort of things you learn because our schools have a way of making you socialize, making you think, making you compete, and American kids come out the best and the brightest in the world. This is why America is what it is. Now, another argument we're discussing is well, some kids shouldn't go to college. You know, Charles has written a lot about IQ, IQ tests being determinants of who will and won't succeed in life. To me that's complete baloney. I mean, my whole life I've faced stereotypes because I happen to be like a -- you know, one -- a race that may not be very smart. In my youth it just be that my people were beggars and snake charmers, then we became low level engineers, now we're hotshot CEOs.[laughter]</p><p end="2104" is_meta="false" speaker="Vivek Wadhwa" start="2042">In my lifetime I've seen the transformation of how people perceive me. So if I was going by these classifications of who should be and who shouldn't be educated, my people shouldn't get education because we don't really deserve it, we're not going to be successful, therefore, leave us out.</p><p end="2162" is_meta="false" speaker="Vivek Wadhwa" start="2104">You'll find the same thing with many other minorities in America. We don't know. I tell you if -- I know from my own children that they've gone through gyrations, so trying to decide what they want to be when they grow up. When they were young, they had some ideas. They don&#8217;t -- other ideas. Now, if I had to decide when my sons were 16 years old, whether they would go to school or not based on their aptitude, it would be the worst decision I could possibly ever make because I&#8217;d be wrong. Both of them decided to do completely different things than what they were talking about when they were young. Children don&#8217;t know. So who are we? Who are parents to try to figure out whether they should get education or not? America is what it is because of our education system. America started educating the masses, and its productivity rose. We became the most fiercely competitive land in the world because we educated everyone.</p><p end="2162" is_meta="false" speaker="Vivek Wadhwa" start="2104">Now there are a lot of people left out as Henry talked about, but the solution to fixing America&#8217;s competitiveness is to bring everyone up to educate everyone. Now we can debate what a college is. To me, a community college is a college.</p><p end="2222" is_meta="false" speaker="Vivek Wadhwa" start="2162">A college -- you know, Peter Thiel basically has lived in this bubble called Silicon Valley where everyone thinks -- when they think college, they think Stanford. They think Berkeley maybe, so, you know, one level below Stanford, but that&#8217;s it. And when he talks and when he gives all these great talks about education, he talks about $200,000 of debt, $250,000 of debt. I know some great people who have gone to community colleges who have almost no debt, who worked part time, been able to pay their fees off. Our community colleges in this country are also colleges, and they too are better than the best -- they too are better than the best institutions in most other countries of the world. I don&#8217;t know why we keep forgetting that. Now, I also taught, you know, I teach at several universities. I was at [unintelligible] University, and my students brought up Peter Thiel. He&#8217;s quite a legend worldwide now. They were talking -- they said, &#8220;Professor, is there really an American investor who&#8217;s paying children to drop out of college?&#8221; I mean, they were so, so confused. At the end of it, we talked about it, and they said, &#8220;You know, this is great because we&#8217;re going to eat their lunch.&#8221;</p><p end="2283" is_meta="false" speaker="Vivek Wadhwa" start="2222">This is what they were thinking. They didn&#8217;t say it. But this is what&#8217;s happening in the world right now. Just as we had these stupid debates about educating our children, the rest of the world has learned our trick. India and China are now graduating 1.5 million engineers a year. They&#8217;re educating all their people because they know that it&#8217;s going to make them like America, and they&#8217;re going to eat our lunch. So if we keep having these silly debates about four-year degrees and this and that, we&#8217;re going to lose out. You talk about entrepreneurship, again -- again, I have a lot of respect for Peter Thiel while chatting with him, but, you know, he talks about entrepreneurs who can be pulled out of school and do very successful. Fine. They&#8217;re 25, maybe 200, 2,000 people in America who don&#8217;t need to go to college. I have researched this systematically. What we found was that the difference between entrepreneurs in the tech industry, in the same world that Peter comes from, the difference between entrepreneurs who have a Bachelor&#8217;s degree and who have a high school degree is huge, almost two-to-one in terms of revenue and number of employees.</p><p end="2343" is_meta="false" speaker="Vivek Wadhwa" start="2283">In terms of success, that&#8217;s how much difference education makes. Now, the interesting thing is what we also learned was that it doesn&#8217;t matter what school you graduate from.</p><p end="2343" is_meta="false" speaker="Vivek Wadhwa" start="2283">The tech founders in America, the most successful people in America graduated from a wide assortment of universities. There are almost as many universities as there were entrepreneurs in the research we did. It didn&#8217;t matter whether you graduated from a community college or whether you graduated from Harvard. You could still make it big as an entrepreneur. Why? Because school gave you that basic foundation to be able to learn. Now, moving forward, the Indian and Chinese are going to be eating our children&#8217;s lunch, guaranteed. I mean, I&#8217;ve researched it enough to know that we have a lot to worry about. If we disarm [spelled phonetically] right now and stop teaching them, we&#8217;re going to become like they used to be. They are absolutely going to demolish this country. And what&#8217;s going to happen is that globalization is going to wreck havoc on industries. Already we&#8217;re talking about manufacturing. We&#8217;re talking about several industries now going offshore. It&#8217;s going to happen more and more.</p><p end="2343" is_meta="false" speaker="Vivek Wadhwa" start="2283">We&#8217;re going to have to keep constantly reeducating our workforce.</p><p end="2403" is_meta="false" speaker="Vivek Wadhwa" start="2343">Ten years from now, we&#8217;re going to have to have massive retraining programs for our workforce. If you don&#8217;t even have a Bachelor&#8217;s degree, if you don&#8217;t even have basic education, you&#8217;re beyond hope. These people may be end up, you know, waiting tables at restaurants, but we&#8217;re going to have too many of those. We need to provide our workforce with a basic education. I say we&#8217;d have to have every American getting at least a Bachelor&#8217;s degree and encouraging them to do Master&#8217;s and Ph.D.s.</p><p end="2524" is_meta="false" speaker="Peter Thiel" start="2463">Well, it certainly was not historically part of the American dream. So if you looked at how many people went to college in the U.S. in the 19th or early 20th century, it was a very, very small percentage. And it was -- this is a very recent phenomenon that this is seen as an absolute necessity. And I think -- I think in many ways I would actually flip it around, and I would say, what's gone wrong with the American dream that we have to have people go to college when that was never a necessity in the past. People don't need college degrees for many of the jobs that we have. There are many good jobs where you don't need them, many bad jobs. People get stuck with college degrees. But I'd actually flip it around. This whole question of what sort of a good is college. Is it an investment in your future? I don't think it's a good investment because it's costing toomuch, and there's no -- seemingly no accountability whatsoever from the other side on the costs.</p><p end="2581" is_meta="false" speaker="Peter Thiel" start="2524">It was absolute good, any price. Pay no attention what the price is. Is it a consumption decision? And I sort of have joked that it's like a four-year party. And I think that's kind of true, but I think people are too stressed out to really have a four-year party when they're taking on a quarter million in debt and know they're going to be debt slaves for the rest of their lives or for the next 10, 20 years. And so I think the way to think of it is that it's basically become an insurance policy because the cracks in our society have become so big. And we need to be asking why are so many people having to pay more and more for insurance and what's gone wrong that we're paying so much for insurance.</p><p end="2581" is_meta="false" speaker="Henry Bienen" start="2524">Well, I didn't think this was a debate about cost. I'd be quite happy to talk about cost. A lot of the sticker price is discounted, as you know, through very substantial financial aid.</p><p end="2643" is_meta="false" speaker="Henry Bienen" start="2581">Plus I also took literally the topic of college which means lots of low-cost colleges Vivek and others and myself pointed out. I don't think it's a nightmare for people. I think most people come out of a college experience feeling better. In fact, there's even surveys about how do you feel. You feel better as a person. And it's quite positive. I think of it as a consumption good but not as a full-time party for four years. No doubt there are some people who do that. Woe to them. But it's a consumption good in that there's something good in and of itself of learning about beautiful things and learning more analytical ways of thinking. It was Steve Jobs himself, the late Steve Jobs, who said when he came back after dropping out of Reed and sat in on courses, he took a calligraphy course. And that calligraphy course gave him a whole new world of thinking about design. Who knows what, in the college experience will trigger for people thinking about the world in a different way.</p><p end="2704" is_meta="false" speaker="Henry Bienen" start="2643">John Donvan:Let me go to Charles Murray and -- maybe we want to discuss what the metric is, how do we describe whether college is worth it. And your opponent is saying, you know, you can learn beautiful ideas. And I was an English major, and I speak English now superbly.</p><p end="2704" is_meta="false" speaker="Henry Bienen" start="2643">It's been very practical and useful for me. But -- but seriously, is there -- are we putting dollar and cents measurement on something that needs to be measured more broadly than that?</p><p end="2704" is_meta="false" speaker="Charles Murray" start="2643">Well, I'm not doing that when I say that too many kid are going to college. I'm coming at it -- again, let's go back to the American dream thing. In 1960, which wasn't that long ago for somebody as old as I am, only eight percent of American adults had college degrees. So college was a big deal then. But 92 percent didn't, including most of the successful people in this country. Not having a college degree had no relationship to the American dream at all at that time.</p><p end="2768" is_meta="false" speaker="Charles Murray" start="2704">College did have prestige. But you didn't look down on somebody who hadn't gone to college. And one of the things we don't like to say any more, but it is absolutely true, is we do now. If you are just a high school graduate, you are a second class citizen in this country. That is a kind of destruction of the American dream that I think it's becoming like a caste system where if you go not just to college but to an elite college, the doors will open and you are going to be a success, and you don't give [spelled phonetically]</p><p end="2768" is_meta="false" speaker="Charles Murray" start="2704">into that --</p><p end="2768" is_meta="false" speaker="Charles Murray" start="2704">No, I'm not.</p><p end="2768" is_meta="false" speaker="Charles Murray" start="2704">The caste system is real. I mean, how many people out in the audience can tell to a fare-thee-well when someone says what college they graduated from, you know very well, you go clicking through your mind, and you can place that college as to where it is in the stratification.</p><p end="2823" is_meta="false" speaker="Charles Murray" start="2768">John Donvan:The argument that your opponents have made that a Bachelor's degree is meaningless,</p><p end="2823" is_meta="false" speaker="Charles Murray" start="2768">now you -- you meant that in the extreme. I'm sure you're -- you also said that it --</p><p end="2823" is_meta="false" speaker="Charles Murray" start="2768">If that's the only bit of information you have about a person, you don't know a thing.</p><p end="2823" is_meta="false" speaker="Vivek Wadhwa" start="2768">I want to tell you, and mostly again because I am an immigrant, and I understand the American dream more -- better than most Americans do. Look at the rise of America relative to its education. We rose -- you know, in the '50s and the '60s, we were coming out of the war. It was a different era. Over the last 50 or 60 years, we've become "the"</p><p end="2823" is_meta="false" speaker="Vivek Wadhwa" start="2768">only world super power. Yes, the economy is in the tank right now. Yes, things are bad.</p><p end="2823" is_meta="false" speaker="Vivek Wadhwa" start="2768">We'll come out of it. This country keeps reinventing itself because it has smart people who can think outside the box that -- who can reinvent themselves over and over again.</p><p end="2823" is_meta="false" speaker="Vivek Wadhwa" start="2768">Yes, there's some outliers who can't. But the average American can reinvent him or herself, and that's what makes this country what it is.</p><p end="2883" is_meta="false" speaker="Vivek Wadhwa" start="2823">Bachelor's degrees, if we want to declare -- bachelor's degree is irrelevant, then let's invent something new. But we're not going to be able to change the system like that.</p><p end="2883" is_meta="false" speaker="Vivek Wadhwa" start="2823">Like you said, if we outlaw bachelor's degrees, we're going to declare defeat to the rest of the world because the rest of the world has caught the American dream. Those Chinese students I talk about, they are just like my students here at Duke and at Berkeley are. They're just like the students we meet over here. They read the books.</p><p end="2883" is_meta="false" speaker="Vivek Wadhwa" start="2823">They follow us. They understand what we're doing. They want to get those bachelor's because they want to get master's, and they want to get PhDs. That's how it is. So forget about our vision of the American dream. We're now a small part of the world.</p><p end="2883" is_meta="false" speaker="Vivek Wadhwa" start="2823">Our economy is becoming a decreasing part of the world. We're going to be competing like you won't believe over the next 10, 20, 30 years.</p><p end="2883" is_meta="false" speaker="Peter Thiel" start="2823">Let me just tackle this whole globalization international thing. So I think there obviously are a lot of things that are very admirable about India, China. People have a great work ethic. They're thinking very much about the future. And I do not want to at all underestimate how serious the competition is or to encourage people to be complacent.</p><p end="2944" is_meta="false" speaker="Peter Thiel" start="2883">But the proposition we're debating today, do too many kids go -- are too many kids going to college, and if you look at those countries, the percentage is much smaller, and it is -- you know, I looked these numbers up because I figured -- I thought you might make this argument. And the U.S. -- there are about 40 percent of college-aged students are in college. And of course there are a lot of them that end up dropping out.</p><p end="2944" is_meta="false" speaker="Peter Thiel" start="2883">It starts at more than 40. But on average, 40 percent fromr in college. In China, the number is 20 percent. In India, the number is 10 percent. And if you want to look at China and India, it is a brutally selective system. Very few people can get in. People are worked incredibly hard once they're in college. And if we want to be more like them,</p><p end="2944" is_meta="false" speaker="Peter Thiel" start="2883">the first thing -- simple approximation is you have far fewer people go to college. And this is true of any other country in the world you'd look at. And so if the U.S. should take its bearings from other countries, that is a very powerful argument for our side.</p><p end="2944" is_meta="false" speaker="Henry Bienen" start="2883">Well, at one time, it wasn't so long ago, the United States was first in the world in post-</p><p end="2944" is_meta="false" speaker="Henry Bienen" start="2883">secondary enrollment.</p><p end="3001" is_meta="false" speaker="Henry Bienen" start="2944">And whatever post-secondary enrollments meant. And now we're -- we were 12th a few years ago. I think we've actually fallen to 15 to 16. If anybody thinks that's a good idea, they would think again.</p><p end="3001" is_meta="false" speaker="Vivek Wadhwa" start="2944">I want to add one more perspective getting back to the Indians and Chinese. Yes, it's a smaller percent of the population. But look at the industry in which everyone is moving,</p><p end="3001" is_meta="false" speaker="Vivek Wadhwa" start="2944">technology, engineering. 1.5 million versus about 100, 150,000 of ours. They're eating our lunch. You should -- you know, they have become -- India has become a [unintelligible] $80 billion IT industry which came out of nothing at all the last 15 years.</p><p end="3001" is_meta="false" speaker="Vivek Wadhwa" start="2944">How? By educating its people. Zero to $80 billion in 15 years.</p><p end="3058" is_meta="false" speaker="Vivek Wadhwa" start="3001">Absolutely. I would educate everyone in the world because it uplifts society. What it does is it improves -- because the low-level jobs are going to go away. Robotics are going to take over manufacturing in the next ten years or so. So those jobs which could be menial jobs that you could have non-educated people doing, they're going to disappear. It's become a knowledge economy where everyone has to now do intelligent things or they're unemployed.</p><p end="3058" is_meta="false" speaker="Charles Murray" start="3001">But look at the way the caste system persists because you have good jobs which is being a lawyer or a doctor or a scientist, and then you have menial jobs. Now, tell me where it is written that we ought to --</p><p end="3058" is_meta="false" speaker="Vivek Wadhwa" start="3001">[unintelligible], Charles, you're creating a new caste system [spelled phonetically].</p><p end="3058" is_meta="false" speaker="Charles Murray" start="3001">But let me finish my sentence.</p><p end="3058" is_meta="false" speaker="Charles Murray" start="3001">That we ought to think about what is more intrinsically rewarding about being a lawyer than being a cabinetmaker? Why does that have -- should that have any privilege over being a cabinetmaker? There are a whole lot of jobs in this world which are wonderfully fulfilling that don't require a college degree and we talk about them as being vocational training.</p><p end="3125" is_meta="false" speaker="Charles Murray" start="3058">That is a kind of invidious caste system in education that I want to destroy by getting rid of college degrees.</p><p end="3125" is_meta="false" speaker="Charles Murray" start="3058">John Donvan:Charles, which jobs are you talking about because what the other side is arguing is that those jobs are disappearing due to automation and robots, et cetera.</p><p end="3125" is_meta="false" speaker="Charles Murray" start="3058">Wait a minute, skill jobs, listen, you want to hire a lawyer or a doctor you can do that in a nanosecond. You want to find good skilled labor? That's hard. Finding a good plumber, a good electrician to come and fix things, that's hard. We have a demand for a wide variety of skills --</p><p end="3125" is_meta="true" speaker="Charles Murray" start="3058">applause</p><p end="3125" is_meta="false" speaker="Charles Murray" start="3058">-- a wide variety of skills that we aren't meeting because guess what that's demeaning [unintelligible] those occupations.</p><p end="3125" is_meta="false" speaker="Henry Bienen" start="3058">But now, Charles wants to overturn the wage structure of the world, not just the U.S.,</p><p end="3125" is_meta="false" speaker="Henry Bienen" start="3058">he wants to overturn the return to knowledge. I don't have any bias against craft skills and I agree that sometimes they're in very short supply and they get a good return, but we -- you know, if you believe at all in markets, I assume, Charles, coming from where he comes from and with his ideas believes in markets, people pay a return to something that they think is relatively scarce or that they value in some way.</p><p end="3186" is_meta="false" speaker="Henry Bienen" start="3125">And sometimes it's a great scientist and sometimes it's a great artist and sometimes it's a great craft person. But that's the way it works, so you can have a lot of complaints about college and cost [spelled phonetically], but now he wants to complain about the world wage structure.</p><p end="3186" is_meta="false" speaker="Vivek Wadhwa" start="3125">But the jobs --</p><p end="3186" is_meta="true" speaker="Vivek Wadhwa" start="3125">talking simultaneously</p><p end="3186" is_meta="false" speaker="Vivek Wadhwa" start="3125">I said the jobs they're talking about, the plumbers and electricians, they're less than one percent of the U.S. population. What about the other 99 percent? What do they do?</p><p end="3186" is_meta="false" speaker="Charles Murray" start="3125">You know, one of the great television shows on TV is "Dirty Jobs." Any of you ever seen it? Every week they go to a dirty job but the thing is you find out a couple of things,</p><p end="3186" is_meta="false" speaker="Charles Murray" start="3125">there are a huge number of ways to make your living.</p><p end="3240" is_meta="false" speaker="Charles Murray" start="3186">They are interesting, they are fulfilling, the people who are doing the, you'd like to know --</p><p end="3240" is_meta="false" speaker="Vivek Wadhwa" start="3186">One percent of the population --</p><p end="3240" is_meta="false" speaker="Charles Murray" start="3186">-- it is a great curative for the kind of way we are talking about the job structure, which has nothing to do with wages, it has to do with making a living in a way that is fulfilling and satisfying.</p><p end="3240" is_meta="false" speaker="Vivek Wadhwa" start="3186">How would you pick someone who goes to school?</p><p end="3240" is_meta="false" speaker="Charles Murray" start="3186">I want absolutely open competition for every position in any kind of educational institution no matter what it's teaching. Where you got the idea I want to put IQ scores on kids' foreheads --</p><p end="3240" is_meta="false" speaker="Vivek Wadhwa" start="3186">Look on the bell curve.</p><p end="3240" is_meta="false" speaker="Charles Murray" start="3186">-- say, "You can go to college, and you cannot," I'd like you to read a passage of anywhere that I've said that.</p><p end="3308" is_meta="false" speaker="Peter Thiel" start="3240">Well, you know, we can find all sorts of anecdotal things. We were told by the other side that we shouldn't look at anecdotes like Zuckerberg or Gates or Jobs and I agree those are exceptional cases, and there obviously are all sorts of people who have idiosyncratic things that can happen in college. They can also happen outside of college.</p><p end="3308" is_meta="false" speaker="Peter Thiel" start="3240">Socialization does not have to happen in college. People should learn how -- you know,</p><p end="3308" is_meta="false" speaker="Peter Thiel" start="3240">this is again a really bizarre recent phenomenon, you know, 92 percent of the people did not go to college in 1960, they were able to be citizens, they were able to vote, they were able to be -- you know, we wouldn't say nobody should have voted in 1960 because they didn't have college degrees.</p><p end="3371" is_meta="false" speaker="Peter Thiel" start="3308">That would have been an invidious thing to say.</p><p end="3371" is_meta="false" speaker="Peter Thiel" start="3308">Oh, I think there are extraordinary conflicts of interest. It&#8217;s like subprime mortgage brokers saying people should buy houses. I mean, the self dealing that is going on is incredibly severe in all of this. And I do think --</p><p end="3371" is_meta="false" speaker="Peter Thiel" start="3308">One other -- one last point. I don&#8217;t think you can separate the question entirely from the cost question. And so it&#8217;s like saying, you know, &#8220;Mrs. Lincoln, besides that, how&#8217;d you like the play?&#8221; So besides the fact that college costs you an arm and a leg, how much do you like it? And these two things are linked together.</p><p end="3420" is_meta="false" speaker="Henry Bienen" start="3371">Well, we -- well, first of all, Northwestern, I can tell you, the full -- if you are a full tuition payer and you had no financial aid at all, you are paying about 60, 65 percent of the total cost of the university, and it leaves out a lot of other things that universities do,</p><p end="3420" is_meta="false" speaker="Henry Bienen" start="3371">which lead to higher costs, some of which I approve of and some of which I don&#8217;t. But we&#8217;re the research generators of the world in American universities today. Bell Labs is gone. The big pharmas have offshored their research. We&#8217;ve adopted those costs.</p><p end="3420" is_meta="false" speaker="Henry Bienen" start="3371">Now, not every university is a research university. It&#8217;s not a Northwestern or a Duke or a Stanford, but I want to speak to the question of cost directly since our opponents,</p><p end="3420" is_meta="false" speaker="Henry Bienen" start="3371">though I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s the subject of the debate. But you know, we don&#8217;t have to induce anybody to come to Northwestern.</p><p end="3484" is_meta="false" speaker="Henry Bienen" start="3420">We get 33,000, 34,000 applicants for something like an entering class of 2,000 students.</p><p end="3484" is_meta="false" speaker="Henry Bienen" start="3420">So -- and that is true of the elite universities. Not all universities look like that. That&#8217;s true. And there is this range of places, which we&#8217;ve tried to talk about. If you believe in demand at all, people are still voting with their feet. And by the way, it&#8217;s foreigners who are voting with their feet because they want to come to American universities for the Ph.D. level. We&#8217;ve talked about undergraduate education a lot. But there&#8217;s something else that universities do out there, or at least certain kinds of universities which are very, very important. It&#8217;s a very important function for the place that I --</p><p end="3545" is_meta="false" speaker="Vivek Wadhwa" start="3484">College -- community college is college.</p><p end="3545" is_meta="false" speaker="Henry Bienen" start="3484">Some common ground. I&#8217;m not so willing to consign the B.A. four-year to the dustbin of history, as Charles is. But I don&#8217;t think everything will or should stay the same.</p><p end="3601" is_meta="false" speaker="Henry Bienen" start="3545">I don&#8217;t disagree with that. I don&#8217;t believe -- for example, take distance learning. I suspect we&#8217;re probably on the same page. I think you&#8217;re going to see more distance learning, even at the major four-year universities. It&#8217;s going to happen. People can take a statistics course online. I&#8217;m chairman of the board of a company called Ithaca Harbors where we&#8217;re doing research on how people learn online. Maybe they learn statistics online as well as being in a classroom. Maybe they can even do Econ 101 like that. I don&#8217;t know. We&#8217;ll see. I&#8217;m for experimenting. Our law school went from everybody in a three-year law school program to some people in a two-year program. I think the great universities will change. They should change. Not everybody has to be in a bricks-and-</p><p end="3601" is_meta="false" speaker="Henry Bienen" start="3545">mortar place. Online, for-profits, can be solely online or 70 percent online courses. So we ought to think about this in a flexible way. I don&#8217;t disagree with Charles and Peter on that.</p><p end="3601" is_meta="false" speaker="Charles Murray" start="3545">I think we can close down the discussion.</p><p end="3665" is_meta="false" speaker="Charles Murray" start="3601">All I&#8217;m asking is we don&#8217;t put kids in the straightjacket of the BA and we enable them to get certifications that show what they know even if it's -- even if they'd done it all online and that the B.A. loses its mystique.</p><p end="3665" is_meta="false" speaker="Peter Thiel" start="3601">I think -- I think what Charles and I -- what Charles and I agree on very much is that there is no one size fits all approach. There are certain skilled people, very talented people.</p><p end="3665" is_meta="false" speaker="Peter Thiel" start="3601">Not every talented person should go to Harvard. You know, there are a lot of different kinds of things different people should do. And I think that's -- that's sort of a basicstarting point. We don't believe there is a single straight jacket. And the crazy thing in our society is that the more talented you are, the narrower the straight jacket has become. This is a very, very bizarre feature [spelled phonetically] of it.</p><p end="3728" is_meta="false" speaker="Peter Thiel" start="3665">We also agree that learning is generally a very good thing. And we agree that we should be -- I think we all four of us agree on that. But there's a bit of a disagreement that I don't want to understate, is that a great deal of what masquerades as learning is nothing more than credentialing. And the basic numbers I've seen is that it's something like 90 percent credentialing, 10 percent learning if you try to sort of break the numbers out. If you got into Harvard versus finishing high school, let's say you make 30,000 a year in -- out of high school, 60,000 a year out of Harvard. Let's say it's two to one,</p><p end="3728" is_meta="false" speaker="Peter Thiel" start="3665">something in that ballpark. You get to 45,000, if you were good enough to get into Harvard, that's the selection. And you get to 57,000 people knew you got into Harvard,</p><p end="3728" is_meta="false" speaker="Peter Thiel" start="3665">that's the signaling. So 90 percent is credentialing. And the learning gets you from 57 to 60. We're in favor of that 10 percent. But it is outrageous how it's been conflated with this credential which is being parasitically charged to people in this -- way costs have escalated and escalated and escalated.</p><p end="3903" is_meta="false" speaker="Peter Thiel" start="3834">Well, I think -- I think the social networks are quite valuable. It's -- it's not clear people should be -- it's still not clear that it justifies the college's paying -- charging a quarter million. I think the social networks tend to be the most valuable only at the elite colleges. Once you go below that level, they actually function in a way where people,</p><p end="3903" is_meta="false" speaker="Peter Thiel" start="3834">again, do not have access. So I think you have a very ambiguous aspect -- aspect about how it works. In practice, in Silicon Valley, most of the companies do get started by people who are a few years out of college. And I tend to think that when I startedPayPal, there were some people I brought in from Stanford, but you know, I started with a colleague who, we met in a different social context in Silicon Valley.</p><p end="3966" is_meta="false" speaker="Peter Thiel" start="3903">And we'd gone to different schools, so it ended up being somewhat -- my own experience was different. But I think -- you know, I do -- I do think elite colleges have a social networking value.</p><p end="3966" is_meta="false" speaker="Peter Thiel" start="3903">It's very -- that's a very oddly different thing from what we've heard here. That's very different from that's about learning, that it's about turning people into citizens or anything like that. And it seems to me that even if that's true, it should cost way, way less.</p><p end="3966" is_meta="false" speaker="Vivek Wadhwa" start="3903">You know, not just elite colleges. Peter keeps talking about a quarter million dollars.</p><p end="3966" is_meta="false" speaker="Vivek Wadhwa" start="3903">That's Stanford. The rest of America is not Stanford. Most colleges are much, much cheaper. And the direction the students have are the same. It's not that the elite, you know, students at Stanford have a big advantage over the others. It's just that they happen to have gone to a nicer campus. So the social network is equally important no matter where you go. Now, the other thing is that if you don't go to college, if you drop -- forget about dropping out. If you went directly from high school to work, you're going to have a very junior position in some big company or some startup where you have very limited interaction with anyone else.</p><p end="4026" is_meta="false" speaker="Vivek Wadhwa" start="3966">You're not going to build a social skills. You're not going to have a network greater than the handful of people that you happen to work with in your department. I don't know how many of you worked in big companies or any companies. But it's always [unintelligible] to people you're exposed to. When you're in college, you're interacting with lots and lots of people all across the board. It's those interactions that define you.</p><p end="4026" is_meta="false" speaker="Vivek Wadhwa" start="3966">They can't be quantified. But that's what carries you through your whole life. You get to meet diverse people. It's not just people who happen to work in the same field and the same company that you do. So the kids that are dropping out and starting their own startups, they're going to be disadvantaged for the rest of their lives. I don't know what they're going to be 30 years from now because they haven't had that social interaction which defines human beings. We need that. We need that extra three or four years where you get to stabilize and learn and become who you are and decide what you want to be when you grow up.</p><p end="4026" is_meta="false" speaker="Vivek Wadhwa" start="3966">Male Speaker:Peter --</p><p end="4026" is_meta="false" speaker="Vivek Wadhwa" start="3966">You don't know that going into college.</p><p end="4082" is_meta="false" speaker="Peter Thiel" start="4026">Well, I didn't know what else to do. And I think I probably would not have known what else to do. In some ways, I was probably a candidate for a good general liberal arts humanities education in many ways. I was really interested in learning. I was very interested in these things on their terms. I don't think most people are like me. I think a lot of people are at a different -- at a different place.</p><p end="4082" is_meta="false" speaker="Vivek Wadhwa" start="4026">Peter, they are like you. They are like you. They don't know what they want to be.</p><p end="4082" is_meta="false" speaker="Peter Thiel" start="4026">It's -- I don't think people are identical. I think this is like -- this is --</p><p end="4082" is_meta="false" speaker="Vivek Wadhwa" start="4026">They're not as smart as you, but they are like you. I tell you.</p><p end="4082" is_meta="false" speaker="Peter Thiel" start="4026">I know that this is a big philosophical disagreement we have. We should not understate.</p><p end="4082" is_meta="false" speaker="Peter Thiel" start="4026">I don't think everybody is cut from the same cloth. People are actually different. And we need to acknowledge the diversity that exists in our world and we shouldn't pretend that everybody is the same and everybody should do the same thing.</p><p end="4082" is_meta="false" speaker="Vivek Wadhwa" start="4026">Peter, you didn't know what you wanted to be when you were young. Most children don't know. They're muddling through it.</p><p end="4324" is_meta="false" speaker="Charles Murray" start="4264">I'm sorry.</p><p end="4324" is_meta="false" speaker="Charles Murray" start="4264">No. It's because of the college degree, you may have heard me say this, doesn't mean anything. If you say, "Oh, well, if you have a classical education and that becomes the standard of what goes into a B.A. and you can be confident that's what a kid has gotten when they have a B.A., then you'd have a very different kind of value associated with a B.A., but it doesn't happen right now.</p><p end="4324" is_meta="false" speaker="Henry Bienen" start="4264">If we have fewer people who go to college, the premium of wages will go up in China and India and Brazil and Turkey where the jobs will go, and those folks will benefit.</p><p end="4380" is_meta="false" speaker="Henry Bienen" start="4324">Well, I think one of the problems in the U.S., and I said this earlier, is that we haven't had a lot of other good options. So I'm not against having vocational streams in high schools, for example Westinghouse High School here, a relatively new high school, is an interesting place. It has both a high performance stream and a vocational stream.</p><p end="4451" is_meta="false" speaker="Henry Bienen" start="4380">See, Mr. Mayor, you send me to these places, I try to learn something about them. So that's okay with me. I'm not against that. I'm not against for more on the job training.</p><p end="4451" is_meta="false" speaker="Henry Bienen" start="4380">Only 10 percent of our labor force has what the Swiss and the Germans would call on the job training. I'm not against that. Americans have decided they didn't want to go in that direction, they didn't want to stream the kids in high school really early. But I think if -- it's not a terrible option at least to open it up.</p><p end="4503" is_meta="false" speaker="Peter Thiel" start="4451">So --</p><p end="4503" is_meta="false" speaker="Peter Thiel" start="4451">-- I actually very much disagree with almost every premise posted in that question but just let me --</p><p end="4503" is_meta="true" speaker="Peter Thiel" start="4451">laughter</p><p end="4503" is_meta="false" speaker="Peter Thiel" start="4451">-- let me just --</p><p end="4503" is_meta="false" speaker="Peter Thiel" start="4451">-- I'll just flag one. The most concrete skill oriented education people get is engineering degrees, and that is actually probably the one area and we may even agree on this where I think the U.S. does not have an excess of engineers. And but that is something that's specific and tracked and engineering is specific and that's what people get paid for the most. And as we were heading into a more technologically oriented world, that's actually -- there's going to probably be an increasing premium on engineering and on specific types of skills. And if I had to give people advice and they were set on going to college, you should study engineering or some form of engineering unless you are in a really unusual situation and really passionate about something else.</p><p end="4562" is_meta="false" speaker="Peter Thiel" start="4503">So I would sort of quibble with the question on that level.</p><p end="4562" is_meta="false" speaker="Henry Bienen" start="4503">Yeah, [unintelligible] because I've been wanting to make this point because I think it was Charles who -- if I were to reinterpret what he said, he wasn&#8217;t against too many kids going to college. He was really against too many kids going to four-year B.A. at expensive colleges. I don&#8217;t think that&#8217;s really a mis-description, but so much of this conversation from Peter and Charles has been a focus where they&#8217;re negative about the general B.A. or presumably the humanities and social sciences. So let me speak up for the humanities and social sciences.[applause]</p><p end="4562" is_meta="false" speaker="Henry Bienen" start="4503">So the, you know, there are lots of smart people who think analytically and rigorously who take the humanities and social sciences, who are art history majors, God love them,</p><p end="4562" is_meta="false" speaker="Henry Bienen" start="4503">and who are historians and who learn Arabic and who learn Chinese, or who learn Hindi or who learn whatever.</p><p end="4626" is_meta="false" speaker="Henry Bienen" start="4562">And we&#8217;re going to send lots of those people. They need to have those languages. They need to learn cultures that are different from the U.S. They&#8217;re going to be business people who go abroad. They&#8217;re going to be diplomats, whoever they may be, so why should we only think that the only place to get an education which is rigorous,</p><p end="4626" is_meta="false" speaker="Henry Bienen" start="4562">analytical, and will serve you well is going to be in the engineering, mathematics --</p><p end="4626" is_meta="false" speaker="Henry Bienen" start="4562">No, nothing I said is against the sciences. I sunk a fortune into the sciences, and we hired the best chemists and computer scientists we could hire, and that&#8217;s great. I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s one hand here or the other hand that. You can do lots of things in a great university.</p><p end="4626" is_meta="false" speaker="Charles Murray" start="4562">I just want to comment that when we talk about the humanities and social sciences and rigorous critical thinking, I&#8217;m not only in favor that, I think we have a darth of it in the university system. The problem is we are talking as if universities consisted of Stanford,</p><p end="4626" is_meta="false" speaker="Charles Murray" start="4562">of Northwestern and Harvard and places like that.</p><p end="4682" is_meta="false" speaker="Charles Murray" start="4626">Very few kids go to those colleges. Most of them are at West Podunk State or its equivalent. And you are talking about course that they&#8217;re no relation --</p><p end="4745" is_meta="false" speaker="Charles Murray" start="4682">Well, may I respond first by saying that if the required course in the humanities was to take The Epic Poem from Homer to Milton, I&#8217;d say that&#8217;s great. If it&#8217;s to take The Epic Film from Ben Hur to Lord of the Rings, it&#8217;s not so great.</p><p end="4802" is_meta="false" speaker="Charles Murray" start="4745">So well -- so what we have as course requirements in this country, it just doesn&#8217;t fit this image you want to see of people sitting Aristotle and the classics and the rest of it. It&#8217;s not the curriculum.</p><p end="4860" is_meta="false" speaker="Henry Bienen" start="4802">It's interesting. The data shows, and the data is conclusive on this, that it's not just getting a degree which increases your life chances and your income. In fact, even in community colleges, which are basically two-year places, if you're in there for a period of time like one semester, you have a better chance, and you'll earn more money than if you never went. And this is true of two-year, four-year colleges, whatever. So it's -- if you look at this, it's almost linear that the more time you spend in college, irrespective of whether you get a degree, pays off for you. Now, there is a sheepskin effect at around 16 years. But it's a little bump. It's not a huge bump so --</p><p end="4926" is_meta="false" speaker="Peter Thiel" start="4860">Well, you know, I think there is -- I think it pays off but not nearly as much as you think because I still think it's mostly correlation and just a tiny bit causation. But I want to quibble a little bit more with the idea of the data shows and what this means.</p><p end="4991" is_meta="false" speaker="Peter Thiel" start="4926">And we're always looking backwards. And so 2005, you could have said the data shows that housing prices always go up. And they are less likely to go up if they've gone up a lot. And so what I will tell you as an analytic truth, not an empirical truth, when people are paying way more than they ever have, there are going to be more people who have been hurt than who were hurt in the '50s or '60s, when it was effectively free. And so --</p><p end="4991" is_meta="false" speaker="Peter Thiel" start="4926">and this will not be seen in advance. You will see this in 10, 15, 20 years time. You're starting to see it with college students, have to move back in with their parents because they cannot afford to get their own place and pay off their debts.</p><p end="4991" is_meta="false" speaker="Peter Thiel" start="4926">It's -- what I think we are seeing a gradually unravel with the -- with this incredible recession in the U.S. because the basic lie that you take on all this debt, and then you get a good job is being seen as not quite true.</p><p end="5042" is_meta="false" speaker="Peter Thiel" start="4991">And there are many cases where it's not true. And I basically think it's sort of -- we see it unravel over four or five years as you have one class after another graduate, and thereare no good jobs, even for the people with college degrees. I would say it's different from housing because there's no specific market. You can't precisely evaluate a college degree. And that's actually one of the things that makes it a much more pernicious bubble than housing because it will not pop instantly, and therefore it's likely to be actually even more pronounced and more extreme before it unravels.</p><p end="5100" is_meta="false" speaker="Henry Bienen" start="5042">Different strokes for different folks. I think it's what you make of it. I think it can be sometimes very focused. It can be, as Vivek has said, people don't know what they want to do until they get there. You learn, how do I know what I want to be until I grow up. I don't have a handy dandy formula. I think it's a good question, but I don't think there's an answer to it that it should be this or that because people are so diverse. They come with different interests, different experiences, different backgrounds. And they grow presumably in those -- in those years in college. And many of them find themselves.</p><p end="5100" is_meta="false" speaker="Henry Bienen" start="5042">They get sparked by different things. I don't know what's going to spark somebody's interest. I mentioned for Steve Jobs it was a calligraphy course he stepped into. For somebody, it may be reading Shakespeare. It may be looking at beautiful paintings. It may be listening to beautiful music.</p><p end="5163" is_meta="false" speaker="Henry Bienen" start="5100">It may be all of a sudden math grabs them, and they didn't know what they could do.</p><p end="5163" is_meta="false" speaker="Charles Murray" start="5100">Well, since I said that virtually everybody needs more education and training after high school, obviously, I think that high school is not sufficient.</p><p end="5223" is_meta="false" speaker="Charles Murray" start="5163">I do think that a great deal of what we talk about as a liberal education can be done at the K-12 level. There are things like the core knowledge curriculum that's created by Edie Hirsch, which is just wonderful. And it doesn't teach everybody a full-fledged classical education, but it -- it gets a lot of the common cultural knowledge for everyone in K-12. We aren't doing it in college. I think we could do it there.</p><p end="5282" is_meta="false" speaker="Peter Thiel" start="5223">It's possible that that's -- well, I think high school is very -- lots of them are still very good. A lot of them are not. But I -- it seems to me that that's a perverse cure for the disease. And so if that is the disease, we should be fixing K through 12 education.</p><p end="5343" is_meta="false" speaker="Peter Thiel" start="5282">And I think probably all of us on the panel would agree that K through 12 education has a lot of room for improvement.</p><p end="5343" is_meta="true" speaker="Peter Thiel" start="5282">applause</p><p end="5343" is_meta="false" speaker="Henry Bienen" start="5282">Well, no one seems to doubt, including our opponents, that there is a wage premium and a benefit to college. They may have some confusion about what kind of college,</p><p end="5343" is_meta="false" speaker="Henry Bienen" start="5282">whether they're expensive or not, though the debate was not about cost, as I understood it.</p><p end="5402" is_meta="false" speaker="Henry Bienen" start="5343">Mr. Thiel raises, I think, interesting points about causation, the direction of causation.</p><p end="5402" is_meta="false" speaker="Henry Bienen" start="5343">But I think it's clear also that going to college isn't of itself an effect. It's a variable which moves people along in their lives, gives them more chance and gives them more income,</p><p end="5402" is_meta="false" speaker="Henry Bienen" start="5343">independent of all the other things that get them to college in the first place. Now, yes,</p><p end="5402" is_meta="false" speaker="Henry Bienen" start="5343">there are too many people who are unprepared that go to college. And I agree with what Peter said at the very last minute, that it would be a perverse effect to say, okay,</p><p end="5402" is_meta="false" speaker="Henry Bienen" start="5343">college is going to be remedial for the lousy high school education that they got. The answer to that, which we're trying very hard to do in Chicago, is to improve the K through 12 elementary and high school education. And that's key. That is key to society as it is to make sure that higher education is good and affordable for all.</p><p end="5467" is_meta="false" speaker="Henry Bienen" start="5402">So the answer is not that too many kids go to college any more than it would be too many kid go to high school or elementary school because they don't get a good education in too many of those places, and I'm sure there are plenty of colleges where they don't get a good education, sure, I'm sure that's the case. I've just never been in any of them but I know that they exist. So I think the answer is very clear and that you have to decide in the negative on the proposition that too many kids go to college. That is after all the proposition, it's not about costs, it's not about whether everything is perfect, at every college in the country, it's not about whether we should do everything exactly how we've done it, it is the proposition that too many kids go to college, and the answer is clearly and unequivocally that's a wrong answer.</p><p end="5522" is_meta="false" speaker="Peter Thiel" start="5467">The one thing that was clearly not done by the other side was to answer my question about where would the accountability be for all the people who get hurt by the system that costs too much and is not delivering. And it is clear to me that there is no accountability on the part of our education establishment. They're not willing to give people refunds. They're not -- you know, if you get a Ford and it blows up, a Ford Pinto blows up, you can go to the Ford company, you can get money back for your car, youmight even be able to sue them for torts, such a mentality is unthinkable in the college case. And given that there is this lack of accountability, buyer beware. You are on your own. You take on the loans. It's worse than housing debt. You can never get out of it,</p><p end="5522" is_meta="false" speaker="Peter Thiel" start="5467">not even through bankruptcy.</p><p end="5583" is_meta="false" speaker="Peter Thiel" start="5522">Bush amended the bankruptcy laws in 2005 so you cannot get out of college debts for the rest of your life. And you need to think about this on your own. The way bubbles end is when people start thinking for themselves. And that is the first thing we want to encourage people to do is not to simply go with the social pressure, not to go with the bill of goods, "This has always been done. This is automatic. This is necessary. This is globalization." But think for yourself, "Is the cost worth the benefit?" And when more people think for themselves about this, we will get to a very different equilibrium where there's less of a caste system, less of a social need to do these things for status reasons,</p><p end="5583" is_meta="false" speaker="Peter Thiel" start="5522">people will still go to college, they will still get advance degrees, but there will be fewer of them who do it because there are a lot of people who are doing it for the wrong reasons, and I think that will be a much healthier and more balanced country.</p><p end="5640" is_meta="false" speaker="Vivek Wadhwa" start="5583">Yeah. What I heard from the other side was that if we define college the way Middle America does, then we actually are agreeing that we want more kids to go to college, so I'm not going to spend my two minutes on that. I want to actually challenge my new friend, Peter Thiel, on something which is very dear to his heart, about the fact that it's so expensive to go to college. That I agree with him on. And it's also antiquated. The system's antiquated. Peter and I are both associated with a great university called Singular [spelled phonetically] University, which is on [unintelligible] campus, where we teach about exponential technologies, how all these advances are happening which can change the world, impact the lives of billions. Well, you know, think about it, five or 10 years ago did you ever use an iPhone or an Android? None of us did. I'll bet youeveryone in the audience has one today. The fact is that it's now possible to communicate in ways we could never do before.</p><p end="5704" is_meta="false" speaker="Vivek Wadhwa" start="5640">We have these tabular devices which can deliver 3D simulations, take us into 3D worlds.</p><p end="5704" is_meta="false" speaker="Vivek Wadhwa" start="5640">We can teach people by taking them into games. We can change the entire concept of education. He has the ability to do that. He has done it before with social network, with Facebook, he's done it with PayPal. He has the ability to do this. Instead of investing in silly little social media technologies, why don't we put our joint efforts into improving education if it's changing the way we deliver, to change the way we educate --</p><p end="5704" is_meta="true" speaker="Vivek Wadhwa" start="5640">applause</p><p end="5704" is_meta="false" speaker="Vivek Wadhwa" start="5640">-- and changing the world. I tell you, Peter, you can make it happen. So I challenge you here publicly to put your energy into improving education, into automating, into rethinking the way we educate so that the masses can get educated because all of us agree that we do want more people to go to whatever we call college. Again, I'm not going to define it as a four-year degree, again to get more education so we can be more competitive, we can take on the world, we can change the world together. We're going to need it more than ever over the next few decades.</p><p end="5704" is_meta="true" speaker="Vivek Wadhwa" start="5640">applause</p><p end="5762" is_meta="false" speaker="Charles Murray" start="5704">I think that even though we're supposed to be diametrically opposed, in fact there&#8217;s a lot of common ground. It&#8217;s not a very good thing to say in a debate. But suppose we got rid of the B.A. because it doesn&#8217;t mean anything. Suppose we had as the goal of education not this piece of paper, but we had as a goal of education that all children shall reach adulthood having discovered things they love to do and having learned how to do them well. If we take that as the goal of education, we will have a system utterly different from the one we have now, and it will not be college as we know it. It will not be four years, and a lot of times, it won&#8217;t be residential. And most of all, it will not separate people into those who are college graduates and those who are not. And thefact is that every career -- excuse me -- goes through a couple of phases. We all start out as apprentices.</p><p end="5824" is_meta="false" speaker="Charles Murray" start="5762">And after we learn our trade, we become journeyman. And some of us who get really good at it become master craftsmen. That is just as true of a history professor or a lawyer or a physician as it of a carpenter or a plumber or an electrician. The kinds of changes we need to make to our educational system, sweeping, fundamental reforms,</p><p end="5824" is_meta="false" speaker="Charles Murray" start="5762">getting rid of the B.A., moving to certifications, has as its ultimate goal, in my view,</p><p end="5824" is_meta="false" speaker="Charles Murray" start="5762">something that is very important for America as it is increasingly stratified by class. And that is that it promotes a recognition among us that we are all engaged in the same process. We are not divided into professionals and service workers or blue collar workers. We all start out as apprentices. We become journeyman, and we all strive to become master craftsmen. Thank you.</p></transcript></debate>
