It is an MIT hard course.</p><p end="385" is_meta="true" speaker="Anant Agarwal" start="325">laughter</p><p end="385" is_meta="false" speaker="Anant Agarwal" start="325">It had differential equations as its prerequisites. And we were petrified we would have a hundred people sign up for the course, looking at the differential equation prerequisites. We were shocked when we had 10,000 people register in the first hour of announcing it. And before we knew it, 155,000 people signed up for this hard course.</p><p end="440" is_meta="false" speaker="Anant Agarwal" start="385">So more people passed this course than I would be able to teach at MIT if I were to teach it at MIT for 40 years.</p><p end="440" is_meta="false" speaker="Anant Agarwal" start="385">7,200.</p><p end="440" is_meta="false" speaker="Anant Agarwal" start="385">The[unintelligible] Ben Nelson.</p><p end="509" is_meta="false" speaker="Ben Nelson" start="440">So we admitted 45 students this year. That represents a 2 1/2 percent acceptance rate.</p><p end="509" is_meta="false" speaker="Ben Nelson" start="440">And we admitted these students not based on an artificial capacity constraint, but we actually admitted every single person that passed our bar, and one of the extraordinary students was right there in the audience.</p><p end="561" is_meta="false" speaker="Ben Nelson" start="509">We are designing the curriculum such that it is made for the very -- the very most capable people in the world.</p><p end="617" is_meta="false" speaker="Jonathan Cole" start="561">I began the fall of 1960. I have never left, and I say I'm not gainfully employable by any other institution, quite frankly.</p><p end="617" is_meta="true" speaker="Jonathan Cole" start="561">laughter</p><p end="617" is_meta="false" speaker="Jonathan Cole" start="561">But I've been here. I've gone through many roles, and I've seen many changes, from wearing a beanie as a freshman and having tug of wars with ropes to -- well, I won't go into the rest. I mean --[laughter]</p><p end="617" is_meta="false" speaker="Jonathan Cole" start="561">If you had a horse.</p><p end="617" is_meta="true" speaker="Jonathan Cole" start="561">laughter</p><p end="617" is_meta="false" speaker="Jonathan Cole" start="561">Rebecca Schuman. She's fantastic, irrepressible, and logically, incredibly sound.</p><p end="677" is_meta="false" speaker="Rebecca Schuman" start="617">Yeah, actually I was just talking to them about it yesterday. I don't teach German right now. I teach something similar to the core curriculum here at Columbia actually. I teach a freshman literature sequence. And I asked them yesterday, "How do you guys feel about MOOCs and how do you feel about online classes?" They didn't know what MOOCs are, and most of them do not like their online classes.</p><p end="677" is_meta="false" speaker="Rebecca Schuman" start="617">John Donvan:Well, that sounds like an advantage for your side already.</p><p end="677" is_meta="true" speaker="Rebecca Schuman" start="617">laughter</p><p end="677" is_meta="false" speaker="Rebecca Schuman" start="617">All right, ladies and gentlemen, Rebecca Schuman. Thank you very much.</p><p end="677" is_meta="true" speaker="Rebecca Schuman" start="617">applause</p><p end="744" is_meta="false" speaker="Rebecca Schuman" start="677">And we're going to be hearing that term, "MOOCs," so stay tuned to hear it defined,</p><p end="744" is_meta="false" speaker="Rebecca Schuman" start="677">because it's important. Now, this is a debate, and that means it's actually a contest, a clash of ideas, and one side will win and one side will lose. And that will be determined by the vote of our live audience here at Columbia University. We want to go now to set you up to vote twice, once before the debate, and once again afterwards. And the way that we determine the winner is the team whose numbers have changed the most. So we want to set you up with the first vote. Go to the keypad at your seat, and register for us where you stand at this point on this motion, "More Clicks, Fewer Bricks: The Lecture Hall is Obsolete." If you agree with this motion at this point push number one.</p><p end="744" is_meta="false" speaker="Rebecca Schuman" start="677">And if you disagree with this motion push number two. And if you are undecided push number three.</p><p end="744" is_meta="false" speaker="Rebecca Schuman" start="677">And the system will lock out in about 20 seconds. If you pushed the wrong button, just correct yourself. It'll lock in your most recent vote, and you can ignore the other keys.</p><p end="744" is_meta="false" speaker="Rebecca Schuman" start="677">They're not live. And, again, at the end of the debate we'll have you vote a second time,</p><p end="744" is_meta="false" speaker="Rebecca Schuman" start="677">and we'll look at the difference between the votes.</p><p end="809" is_meta="false" speaker="Rebecca Schuman" start="744">And the team whose numbers have changed the most in percentage point terms will be declared our winner. So we're going to go in three rounds, and we're just going to start now with round one. Round one, our motion is this, "More Clicks, Fewer Bricks: The Lecture Hall is Obsolete." And here in round one to open and arguing for the motion,</p><p end="809" is_meta="false" speaker="Rebecca Schuman" start="744">Anant Agarwal. He is a professor of electrical engineering and computer science at MIT and the CEO of edX, an online learning destination founded by Harvard at MIT. He'll be making his way to the lectern to make his opening statement. It will be seven minutes long uninterrupted. Ladies and gentlemen, Anant Agarwal.</p><p end="809" is_meta="true" speaker="Rebecca Schuman" start="744">applause</p><p end="809" is_meta="false" speaker="Rebecca Schuman" start="744">Let me just correct. I said seven minutes. It's six minutes of statement. Thank you. The floor is yours.</p><p end="809" is_meta="false" speaker="Rebecca Schuman" start="744">Anant Agarwal:You know, I'm going back to when I was an undergraduate, oh my god, 30 years ago, 32,</p><p end="809" is_meta="false" speaker="Rebecca Schuman" start="744">31 years ago. I'm sitting in class and this is like most of the classes I've been in. This was at IIT in Madras, lots of bright kids around me, extraordinary and bright.</p><p end="861" is_meta="false" speaker="Rebecca Schuman" start="809">And the fifth minute mark was my transition point, I would follow everything the lecturer did, the instructor did until the fifth minute mark, and then at the fifth minute mark I would lose the professor. And I would look at all -- and everybody seemed to be following the professor, but I would've lost the professor and then spent the remaining hour simply scrambling taking notes, completely -- I just lost the professor, scrambling taking down every word with no idea what is going on. I wonder how many of you in the audience have felt like that in a classroom. I won't ask for a show of hands, I just want you to think about it. I certainly felt oh my god, everybody around me knows what's going on, what's up with me? Our education system, this whole system of the lecture and getting together a lot more students in the classroom really is based on the factory model of education.</p><p end="919" is_meta="false" speaker="Rebecca Schuman" start="861">Get a whole bunch of people sitting in a classroom and then you have a person lecturing at them. It's a very, very efficient system, it started a thousand years ago, and this university below me is still standing, it's a thousand years old, and you know what?</p><p end="919" is_meta="false" speaker="Rebecca Schuman" start="861">Nothing has changed. You could wake up a thousand years behind you or a thousand years ahead and absolutely nothing has changed. Everything has changed around us,</p><p end="919" is_meta="false" speaker="Rebecca Schuman" start="861">but the university education system hasn't. Our communication is different. We don't have to yell across a continent. We have smartphones. Our medical system has changed. We don't have to hit somebody on the head to knock them unconscious and operate very quickly. We have laparoscopy today, but education system hasn't changed. We can fly from one continent to another, communicate in all kinds of ways,</p><p end="919" is_meta="false" speaker="Rebecca Schuman" start="861">but our education system hasn't changed. Don&#8217;t you believe it is important? We can do -- the online education of today is very different from my grandfather's online education. It's completely different today.</p><p end="979" is_meta="false" speaker="Rebecca Schuman" start="919">In this new system we can use self-based learning. Just imagine I can watch a video of an instructor. I can pause the video. I can rewind the video. Not once, but six times.</p><p end="979" is_meta="false" speaker="Rebecca Schuman" start="919">Heck, I can even mute the professor.</p><p end="979" is_meta="true" speaker="Rebecca Schuman" start="919">laughter</p><p end="979" is_meta="false" speaker="Rebecca Schuman" start="919">This self-based system allows me to learn at my own pace. I wish I had that when I was an undergraduate student. Another thing, I would submit my homework and I wouldget the graded homework back two weeks later if I was lucky. I still haven't gotten some homework back 32 years later.</p><p end="979" is_meta="true" speaker="Rebecca Schuman" start="919">laughter</p><p end="979" is_meta="false" speaker="Rebecca Schuman" start="919">No feedback. The feedback came too late. I wasn't interested in the feedback when it came late. But in online learning today, if you go onto edX.org or one of the MOOC platforms, feedback is instantaneous. We can grade all kinds of questions, equations we can even grade essays, believe it or not. So that feedback comes instantly. I can get a --</p><p end="979" is_meta="false" speaker="Rebecca Schuman" start="919">when something's wrong I can think about it, fix it. I can learn.</p><p end="1036" is_meta="false" speaker="Rebecca Schuman" start="979">In fact, I learn the most when something is wrong say hey, what do I do here? I can try to fix it. Instant feedback is critical. In the many, many studies education researchers have known this for 40 years. Study Chen in 2003 showed that if you apply instant feedback students learn better. If you don&#8217;t provide instant feedback they don&#8217;t learn as well. We also do another thing, we use active learning. Again, these ideas are old ideas, we've just not applied them. There&#8217;s a very famous paper by Craik and Lockhart talked about active learning. Heck, just go back to Socrates. It's a Socratic method. You know, you teach by asking questions. So now what we can do is we can interweave videos with interactive exercises. So you watch a video at your own pace then you go answer a question to see if you've learned the material or not. This is mastery learning.</p><p end="1036" is_meta="false" speaker="Rebecca Schuman" start="979">If you haven't quite gotten it you go back and review the video or the materials, you come back and you try it again. So this way you don&#8217;t face forward until you have picked up and really learned the material.</p><p end="1100" is_meta="false" speaker="Rebecca Schuman" start="1036">And studies like the Craik and Lockhart study from as early as &#8217;72 has shown that this,</p><p end="1100" is_meta="false" speaker="Rebecca Schuman" start="1036">again, improves learning outcomes. So online learning today incorporates all of these principles and is completely different from what it was before. We can even bring gamification to our system. We can do online labs, check out the demo course on edX,</p><p end="1100" is_meta="false" speaker="Rebecca Schuman" start="1036">it&#8217;s called Demo 101. We have online labs in biology, chemistry, physics, mathematics.</p><p end="1100" is_meta="false" speaker="Rebecca Schuman" start="1036">You can play around and bring gamification into the picture. Our millennial generation is completely different. Just two weeks ago I remember walking past my daughter's room, she's 14, and she was lying in bed. She's got three screens in front of her. Okay,</p><p end="1100" is_meta="false" speaker="Rebecca Schuman" start="1036">on one screen she was doing physics. On the second screen, she swiped my iPad, and she's watching Netflix, and on her third screen, she was &#8220;WhatsApp-ing&#8221;, now, whatever that is, with her friends. It's not tweeting anymore. It's &#8220;WhatsApping&#8221; with her friends. And they learn differently. The millennial generation is able to do these things.</p><p end="1100" is_meta="false" speaker="Rebecca Schuman" start="1036">And then in the classroom, you still need that. You interact with each other, learn the soft skills and so on and so forth.</p><p end="1159" is_meta="false" speaker="Rebecca Schuman" start="1100">But they can get all the content and so on completely online if that's how they want to learn. They want gamification, they want engagement, not the same old boring lecture where they lost the professor after the first minute everywhere. Everybody should really have a high-quality education. And with online learning, I can really bring this to the classroom as well. And bringing online learning to create the blended model of learning.</p><p end="1159" is_meta="false" speaker="Rebecca Schuman" start="1100">In an experiment we did with San Jose State University, they used their online material in class to create the blended model. Students would watch videos, interactive exercises in this active learning model before they came to class. And in class, they would ask questions of the professor, interact with other students and learn soft skills and collaboration. But a big part was online. And here they demonstrated that traditionally, the students were -- 60 percent of the students would pass the course, 40 percent would fail. In this blended model at San Jose State using our material online,</p><p end="1159" is_meta="false" speaker="Rebecca Schuman" start="1100">they found that the failure rate fell to 9 percent.</p><p end="1228" is_meta="false" speaker="Jonathan Cole" start="1159">Thank you. And then there were MOOCs. The latest technological messianic movement that will disrupt and then save higher education. I want to make 12 points in six minutes as to why you should vote against the motion that more clicks will end the need for bricks and alter fundamentally the nature of higher education. Online education will not replace the great colleges and universities in the United States. At the selective colleges, MOOCs will be one of the many forms of new technology that will be useful,</p><p end="1228" is_meta="false" speaker="Jonathan Cole" start="1159">mostly for courses, as was pointed out by my worthy opponent, for those where you can get the right answer that's at the back of the book.</p><p end="1276" is_meta="false" speaker="Jonathan Cole" start="1228">For all other courses where there are subtleties and interpretation, where there's a need to argue, for a close-knit community of participants, where there's a need for critical thinking, for close reading, where analysis plays back and moderates initial formulations, MOOCs will be less useful. In fact, as the biological scientist Stuart Feinstein says, "Questions are more relevant than answers." Indeed, Richard Levin recently signed on as the CEO of Coursera, and he said that it couldn't replace the traditional four-year residential college. Let's take the democratizing effect. Levin says that's what one of the purposes is. But who in fact takes those courses from all over the world.</p><p end="1341" is_meta="false" speaker="Jonathan Cole" start="1276">The noble purpose, the people who take that course at least from the evidence that we have to the moment, are people who are already educated, not the people who we're trying to target for education. The next point is that there is no good empirical evidence that supports the idea that MOOCs represent a disruptive technology that will overturn the current business model of the best colleges and universities. Let me just tick off a few of the things for which there is absolutely no good empirical evidence. There's no economic or cost model that has been shown to work. The cost of creating content is very high. Friends of mine have told me that they spend $100, $200,000 or $300,000 a course. In short, there's no evidence that MOOCs will in fact lower the cost of tuition.</p><p end="1341" is_meta="false" speaker="Jonathan Cole" start="1276">There's no method that has been shown as to how intellectual property will be divided up, how much will go to the professors, how much to the university?</p><p end="1410" is_meta="false" speaker="Jonathan Cole" start="1341">There's no good evidence that MOOCs have a democratizing effect as much as they might be desirable to have a democratizing effect. There's no good evidence of how people with different learning styles respond to the flipped classroom and the MOOC culture on campus. There's no good evidence on how you can examine thousands of people taking online courses without massive cheating. There's no good evidence about who drops out of MOOC courses. Those 7,000 who graduated may well have been people who already took the course at MIT. Now, how do we know who they really are and what their characteristics are? 72 percent of the professors who answered the questionnaire about teaching online courses, who were committed to them, said that they would not give credit for those who did well in the course. Sebastian Thrune, one of the founders of one of the leading MOOCs, Udacity, has said we were on the front pages of the newspapers and magazines and at the same time I was realizing we don't educate people as others wished or as I wished.</p><p end="1456" is_meta="false" speaker="Jonathan Cole" start="1410">We have a lousy product. It was a painful moment. People learn from each other when they eat together, read together, converse together, sleep together. If nothing else, sex will reinforce bricks over clicks on the campus.</p><p end="1456" is_meta="true" speaker="Jonathan Cole" start="1410">laughter</p><p end="1456" is_meta="false" speaker="Jonathan Cole" start="1410">This is not to say, I want you to know that the Khan Academy where small, short, highly focused courses are offered won't be appealing to some. It is, and it will be. But it is not going to end the need for the kind of close interaction that we need to find in the classroom in physical structures. MOOCs will not solve the cost disease.</p><p end="1524" is_meta="false" speaker="Jonathan Cole" start="1456">I will answer what the cost disease is and why they won't actually lower tuition and the increases in tuition that you have read about in the papers during our next part of this debate. Let many platforms grow. I don't know how many of you have seen Brian Greene, the physicist at Columbia's new platform on -- he created for the world science fair, it takes place in New York. He built it himself. It is for people who know nothing about science to Nobel prize winners. It is far more sophisticated than the platforms like edX. One author allowed many of these platforms to grow and see how they work.</p><p end="1524" is_meta="false" speaker="Jonathan Cole" start="1456">MOOCs are one tool that will help to make higher learning better, not cheaper, for both undergraduates and professional school students. It's not likely to infiltrate the world of the laboratory, however. Remember, what makes American universities the greatest system of higher learning in the world is the research discoveries that have changed our lives and the lives of people around the world.</p><p end="1582" is_meta="false" speaker="Jonathan Cole" start="1524">You never hear the MOOC discussers, the MOOC proponents, talk about the influence of MOOCs on laboratory life. It will have a tremendous effect on accessing information;</p><p end="1582" is_meta="false" speaker="Jonathan Cole" start="1524">JSTOR, ARTstor, visual libraries, all of these things are wonderful inventions and part of technology that help us learn. But that is no substitute for being able to analyze Moby Dick.</p><p end="1582" is_meta="false" speaker="Jonathan Cole" start="1524">Thank you.</p><p end="1582" is_meta="true" speaker="Jonathan Cole" start="1524">applause</p><p end="1582" is_meta="false" speaker="Jonathan Cole" start="1524">John Donvan:And here's where we are. We are halfway through the opening round of this Intelligence Squared U.S. debate, where our motion is "more clicks, fewer bricks: The lecture hall is obsolete." You have heard from the first two debaters and now onto the third. I'd like to welcome to the lectern Ben Nelson. He is the founder, chairman and CEO of the Minerva Project. That is a new online undergraduate program that aims to reinvent the university experience.</p><p end="1644" is_meta="false" speaker="Jonathan Cole" start="1582">And, Ben, we had four teachers up here, and I was hoping that one of them would, in the opening statements, explain to those who do not know what a MOOC is. So I want to give you an extra 15 seconds before you launch to tell everyone in our audience and our listeners what this odd word means and why it is exceedingly relevant to this discussion.</p><p end="1644" is_meta="false" speaker="Ben Nelson" start="1582">So a MOOC is a massive open online course. And as Jonathan pointed out, it is one of several formats and technologies used for online education.</p><p end="1644" is_meta="false" speaker="Ben Nelson" start="1582">Thank you. Thank you so much for having us, and thank you, Jonathan, for pointing out two very important things; first, that I should have absolutely gone to Columbia as an undergrad because they have sex in class.</p><p end="1644" is_meta="true" speaker="Ben Nelson" start="1582">laughter</p><p end="1644" is_meta="false" speaker="Ben Nelson" start="1582">And I certainly made a huge mistake going to Penn. We did not have that. And secondly, thank you for making such a compelling argument to vote for this motion.</p><p end="1715" is_meta="false" speaker="Ben Nelson" start="1644">The -- what Jonathan put together as the framework was a critique of the state of online education, not even online education, but a segment of online education today, as it stands. It was not a critique of the potential of online education, and it was based on an analysis of a very small portion of American higher education, these small courses in the most elite institutions in the United States. But we're not talking about the future of themost elite institutions. We're talking about the future of higher education in general.</p><p end="1715" is_meta="false" speaker="Ben Nelson" start="1644">And so let's look at the facts. The facts of the matter are that when you look at what even the elite universities do, they are largely about disseminating knowledge, lecture-</p><p end="1715" is_meta="false" speaker="Ben Nelson" start="1644">based courses, the lecture hall, where a university professor stands up in front of a large audience, gets paid $300,000, $400,000, fully loaded, and teaches one, maybe two courses a year to 200 students, is not an economically viable model.</p><p end="1771" is_meta="false" speaker="Ben Nelson" start="1715">And it is in fact a worse form of delivery than what Anant described, the very first version, the version 1.0, of these massive open online courses. The fact of the matter is,</p><p end="1771" is_meta="false" speaker="Ben Nelson" start="1715">is that all of the problems listed about MOOCs, whether we're talking about who is taking them, cheating, whether we're talking about the completion rates, whether we're talking about whether or not it's economical to create the upfront costs, all of those problems got solved over time. And even before they do, with identity verification online, with the fact that once you create one of these MOOCs, it can be taken to hundreds of thousands of dollars -- once you realize that the fact that these courses are not completed or they're taken by the people that already have a university education,</p><p end="1771" is_meta="false" speaker="Ben Nelson" start="1715">not because they're the only ones that can benefit from them, but because today they're not issued for credit.</p><p end="1819" is_meta="false" speaker="Ben Nelson" start="1771">Compare completion rates at massive open online courses -- that are there purely for fun -- versus the completion rate at Chicago Community College. They're both in the single digit percentages. But when you go to Chicago Community College, you're going there and paying to get your associate's degree. Here you have an opportunity to learn for free, and you have an opportunity to learn at your own pace with those around you.</p><p end="1819" is_meta="false" speaker="Ben Nelson" start="1771">But let's go beyond the lecture. Let's address even the most esoteric elements of higher education. The close conversations between students and professor is small groups that explore subject matter. Well, turns out you can do that online as well, and you can do it in a better way than you can in an offline classroom.</p><p end="1883" is_meta="false" speaker="Ben Nelson" start="1819">When we first created our platform at Minerva, which is limited to 19 students per course, every student is on live video, we went to the University of Washington Medical School and we tested a very rudimentary version of our platform with a live class offline and a live class online, taught by the same professor, the same subject matter. The results were universally accepted that the online class was far superior to the offline class simply for the fact of the matter that even though there were the same number of students in the class, when you look straight into that camera and the professor sees your face and all of the other students see your face, you are paying attention. The professor can call on students and ask them a question and find out what they're goingto answer rather than having them ask or answer at random. So the professor can choose to pick not the right answer but the spectacularly wrong answer which is interesting, one that curates the course of the conversation in ways that simply are not possible offline.</p><p end="1940" is_meta="false" speaker="Ben Nelson" start="1883">What we all have to remember is we are at the dawn of interactive, high quality,</p><p end="1940" is_meta="false" speaker="Ben Nelson" start="1883">personalized education, whether it's a broadcast to many, whether it's in a small seminar format, or whether it is done in an individualized adaptive learning platform that caters the process of education to the individual student. But the fact that we are at the dawn means that none of us in this room, including Anant and myself, who are working on this every day, can conceive where this will bring us in the future. Here's what we do know. We do know that when students are given the option of going to their illustrious lectures, even at the world's best universities, there are far more students on the first day of class than there are on the last day. We know that oftentimes when we ask students, "Did the courses that you took in your college career change your life?</p><p end="2001" is_meta="false" speaker="Ben Nelson" start="1940">Did they make an impactful change in the way you perceive the world?" majority of students say, "No." We know that technologies will continue to improve and will bring intellectual development of students not just among the elite but among students around the world to a newer and higher level. Thank you.</p><p end="2001" is_meta="false" speaker="Rebecca Schuman" start="1940">Thank you. Thank you so much everybody for being here and to my co-panelists for just presenting. Anant, I tried really hard to get my assignments back to my students really fast. I really try my best and I always make it in under two weeks, but now I'm going to try even harder.</p><p end="2057" is_meta="false" speaker="Rebecca Schuman" start="2001">I really appreciate Jonathan. He brought up the fact that in person I like to teach classes where you can't get the answers in the back of the book. In my class there is no back of the book or the back of the book is just the last chapter of the book. It wouldn't really help. And, Ben, I did not know I made $400,000 a year --</p><p end="2057" is_meta="true" speaker="Rebecca Schuman" start="2001">laughter</p><p end="2057" is_meta="false" speaker="Rebecca Schuman" start="2001">To be honest. I teach two classes a year and I make $14,000 a year. So, I don't know.</p><p end="2057" is_meta="false" speaker="Rebecca Schuman" start="2001">I&#8217;m doing it wrong. All right. So what I want to talk to you guys about is the MOOC I'm taking right now. I&#8217;m taking MOOC with edX and you sign up with edX. They ask you why you're signing up and I wrote definitely not for opposition research for the debate I'm going to do.</p><p end="2057" is_meta="true" speaker="Rebecca Schuman" start="2001">laughter</p><p end="2057" is_meta="false" speaker="Rebecca Schuman" start="2001">I didn't say that. It's called Think 101X the science of everyday thinking with two good professors from Australia. Actually, I love it.</p><p end="2117" is_meta="false" speaker="Rebecca Schuman" start="2057">It's great. It's really fun. I've learned all sorts of different nefarious ways my own brain goes behind my back to thwart me. I love it. It's fantastic. It's pretty easy. It doesn't take too much time. I've learned a lot. Should I go over there? But I'm a 37 year old American with a doctorate. I already know how to learn. I learn for fun. I do it as a hobby, and it's a great hobby for me as a dabbler, but I don't think that it is an adequate replacement for college yet. There are a lot of reasons for this, but the number one reason for this is really just one word and that word is contact. Ladies and gentlemen, I hope that you'll vote no on the motion: More Clicks, Fewer Bricks: The Lecture Hall is Obsolete, because more clicks means less contact, less contact with professors like me.</p><p end="2117" is_meta="false" speaker="Rebecca Schuman" start="2057">I'm not a superstar. I'm not a celebrity. I'm not a millionaire. I don't even have tenure and I never will. But that doesn't matter to my students.</p><p end="2182" is_meta="false" speaker="Rebecca Schuman" start="2117">I'm going to talk a little bit about some of my students today. I have one student who lives with dyslexia, and she is so smart in class. She's just bright in class, but her written work really suffers. And if she were taking an online course she might be mistaken quite unfairly for somebody who was not as bright as she is or drunk maybe, I don't know, but the fact that we can actually talk to each other in class has changed her life, because she knows that I know how smart she is. I have another student who is so shy that he shook last semester in class. Whenever I called on him -- I have ways of getting students topay attention, by the way. He shook when I called on him. He gave presentation and he actually stopped halfway through because he went so clammy. Two weeks ago he came in, second semester, same class, Dostoyevsky killed it. Did such a great job. Blew us all away and I was talking to him about his story because I wanted to use it today, and he said I want you to know that our class has helped me learn how to talk to people.</p><p end="2242" is_meta="false" speaker="Rebecca Schuman" start="2182">The importance of that cannot be over-stated. It has helped him learn how to talk to people.</p><p end="2242" is_meta="false" speaker="Rebecca Schuman" start="2182">So, people, my students, actual real people, I know them. They know me. I don&#8217;t just enter their lives with the dissemination of content. They enter mine and we connect,</p><p end="2242" is_meta="false" speaker="Rebecca Schuman" start="2182">we make contact. And that's important when things are going well in class. It&#8217;s even more important when things are going poorly. The community college research center right here at Columbia did a multi-year study where they determined that when students at community colleges and other sort of non-prestige institutions are struggling and they're taking classes online, they're much more likely to fail. They're much more likely to drop out. They're much more likely to give up. So I urge you to vote no on this motion: More Clicks, Fewer Bricks, because with every click a student loses contact.</p><p end="2298" is_meta="false" speaker="Rebecca Schuman" start="2242">With every click the student loses opportunities for growth. With every click the student might even lose their future. So right now students aren&#8217;t just failing online classes in enormous numbers, although they are. Online classes are also failing them. I have a lot more to say on this, but I'd like to transition to discuss, but while I am I'm going to be thinking about my students who all waived their right to privacy for me to be able to shout out to them today. So I hope that like me you'll be thinking of Miranda and Emma and Alex and Alex and Sarah, Sarah, and Sarah, Kayla, Amanda, Katrina,</p><p end="2298" is_meta="false" speaker="Rebecca Schuman" start="2242">Megan, Braxton, Andy, Dick, Sandy, another Rebecca, not me, Josh, Jake and James,</p><p end="2298" is_meta="false" speaker="Rebecca Schuman" start="2242">Taylor, Ryan, Elden and Ethan, Josie, and Dimitri. I think that they deserve contact. I think they deserve devoted personal attention. MOOCs are great for dabbling, and they're great for supplementary education, but I don't think they're a substitute for human interaction.</p><p end="2539" is_meta="false" speaker="Ben Nelson" start="2483">Well, I would argue it has helped. And I think you have to understand the context.</p><p end="2539" is_meta="false" speaker="Ben Nelson" start="2483">Think of the general population educational level in the 1930s around the world. What the radio has done, and television has done, to teach people and some of the information has been dramatic.</p><p end="2598" is_meta="false" speaker="Ben Nelson" start="2539">For example, in India, it's something like a hundred million people have learned to read from a program that adds subtitles to Indian soap operas. And the eye naturally learns to read those subtitles.</p><p end="2598" is_meta="false" speaker="Ben Nelson" start="2539">Correct.</p><p end="2598" is_meta="false" speaker="Ben Nelson" start="2539">It's not interactive. It's broadcast. This is an interactive medium.</p><p end="2666" is_meta="false" speaker="Anant Agarwal" start="2598">I think the big difference this time around is twofold, one is interactivity. And the second big one is exactly the point that my opponents are making, which we can bring online, and it's called peer to peer learning. If you look at Facebook and Twitter and all of these peer groups where teens and grownups in the billions are interacting with each other online, why can't we bring that? Why this scare of technology? Let's bring that into our learning education system and fold that in how people learn online so that the peer learning is part of the platform. As on edX, the whole discussion forum is part of the learning process.</p><p end="2666" is_meta="false" speaker="Jonathan Cole" start="2598">Well, I'd like to just quote from Sherry Turkle who wrote a wonderful little book called "Alone Together." And she's an MIT colleague of yours. And she said, "technology is seductive when what it offers meets our human vulnerabilities." And as it turns out, we are very vulnerable indeed.</p><p end="2734" is_meta="false" speaker="Ben Nelson" start="2666">Well, I encourage all of you after the debate to go and find our student in the audience because she's been on the platform that not only enables that but enables you to have the kinds of debates, the kind of interactions, the kinds of interrogations of students that actually is even more difficult in an off line environment.</p><p end="2779" is_meta="false" speaker="Ben Nelson" start="2734">When you build a platform to teach a hundred thousand students, that's not your goal.</p><p end="2779" is_meta="false" speaker="Ben Nelson" start="2734">Your goal is not to build a platform that optimizes for one-on-one debate. When you build a platform that's about bringing the seminar and adding data to pick which two students will be the ones on both sides of the debate, which kinds of analyses should you go back to in class and listen from another section so you can build upon? That makes online seminars even richer. So even though we don't have as many students on those platforms, this resolution is about where the future of universities will go. The technologies are here now. They will get propagated.</p><p end="2779" is_meta="false" speaker="Jonathan Cole" start="2734">One of the things that came up --</p><p end="2841" is_meta="false" speaker="Jonathan Cole" start="2779">-- in the discussions about MOOCs in -- certainly in the heyday of excitement about their early inception was that they could reach hundreds of thousands of people. If they reach people in the seminar type of arrangement, with 15 or 20 people, it may be possible to generate some of the kind of discourse that you're talking about. But that's not where the imagery of the MOOCs really come from.</p><p end="2841" is_meta="false" speaker="Anant Agarwal" start="2779">So, remember, I just have to respond to that.</p><p end="2841" is_meta="false" speaker="Anant Agarwal" start="2779">The thousand-year-old university system has failed.</p><p end="2841" is_meta="false" speaker="Anant Agarwal" start="2779">They still don't have an economic model. But the point is that in terms of small seminar,</p><p end="2841" is_meta="false" speaker="Anant Agarwal" start="2779">the simple mechanisms are being introduced on the edX platform. It's called a cohort.</p><p end="2841" is_meta="false" speaker="Anant Agarwal" start="2779">You can create Google instant hangouts and small groups of five and ten people,</p><p end="2841" is_meta="false" speaker="Anant Agarwal" start="2779">interact with each other.</p><p end="2901" is_meta="false" speaker="Anant Agarwal" start="2841">And it's much more connecting than a professor picking one student out of a class while 300 other students are sitting there twiddling their thumbs.</p><p end="2901" is_meta="false" speaker="Rebecca Schuman" start="2841">But I don't necessarily want my students to be in charge of each other. I love them. I love them to death. But --</p><p end="2901" is_meta="false" speaker="Rebecca Schuman" start="2841">Their peer review, you know, they're freshmen, they're -- I got rid of peer review in my class because it was like the inmates were in the prison. It made the papers worse. It made things -- they don't -- they're bright, they're inquisitive, they're great, but they don't quite know enough yet to help each other learn in a way that I can help them learn.</p><p end="2956" is_meta="false" speaker="Ben Nelson" start="2901">Well --</p><p end="2956" is_meta="false" speaker="Ben Nelson" start="2901">She can be there in a 15-person breakout. So there's nothing preventing the edX platform from having the professor jump from breakout to breakout. That's just a philosophical point of view, right?</p><p end="2956" is_meta="false" speaker="Ben Nelson" start="2901">Nearly all.</p><p end="2956" is_meta="false" speaker="Ben Nelson" start="2901">Absolutely --</p><p end="2956" is_meta="false" speaker="Jonathan Cole" start="2901">Well, I mean, we didn't see anything yet with the .com bubble either, and that kind of exploded, but the technology was worse at the time.</p><p end="3020" is_meta="false" speaker="Jonathan Cole" start="2956">I guess that I would also say is that learning does not only take place in the lecture room, and the nature of the bricks that bring people together, part of the learning experience, go far beyond necessarily the lecture room. And part of the subtitle of this debate is really whether or not the format and the structures and even the architecture of the old university setting will be obsolete. And I believe that students learn perhaps almost as much or as much outside of the classroom, interacting in these physical spaces, as they do in the classroom.</p><p end="3020" is_meta="false" speaker="Jonathan Cole" start="2956">Yeah, well, I do -- I think the --</p><p end="3020" is_meta="false" speaker="Jonathan Cole" start="2956">Would you turn me to that program?</p><p end="3020" is_meta="true" speaker="Jonathan Cole" start="2956">laughter</p><p end="3020" is_meta="false" speaker="Jonathan Cole" start="2956">What's the website?</p><p end="3020" is_meta="true" speaker="Jonathan Cole" start="2956">laughter</p><p end="3078" is_meta="false" speaker="Jonathan Cole" start="3020">No, I -- well, there I just simply, you know, disagree. I mean, I think that when we are dealing with, let's say, a course that allows you to get answers that are known answers, I have no doubt that this new technology can have an extraordinary influence. But a great teacher, talking about the subtleties of text, about being a perfect reader, of how reading will influence your life, not only in terms of enjoyment, that I think has yet to be demonstrated. This is an assertion by our opponents, our worthy opponents. It is not demonstrated. And as I said earlier, there are a lot of empirical questions that I haven't heard any answers to thus far from my worthy opponents.</p><p end="3078" is_meta="false" speaker="Jonathan Cole" start="3020">John Donvan:We're going to come back to some of those, but I want to let Anant respond to what you just said.</p><p end="3078" is_meta="false" speaker="Anant Agarwal" start="3020">Sure. So you mentioned that -- I think you're making a mistake here. You're comparing the best teacher -- I would love to be in your class, Rebecca.</p><p end="3137" is_meta="false" speaker="Anant Agarwal" start="3078">I think that you would be delightful. With a class of 10 or 15 working with Rebecca, that is fantastic. But how many people around the world -- how many children in the U.S. or the rest of the world can afford that kind of luxury, to have a great teacher in a small classroom setting, talking about reading , non-fixed answers at the end of textbooks?</p><p end="3137" is_meta="false" speaker="Anant Agarwal" start="3078">We have technology today where we can grade essays using machine learning technology. And if you talk to the teachers in the California School District, they are saying they are giving their children fewer essays because they just don't have the time to grade. I know teachers in high school, I know my wife who teachers, they spend hours and hours grading essays. That is a good thing, and as long as there are teachers like Rebecca to grade my essays and give me instant feedback, that is fantastic. But what about all the students where teachers are not able to give essays and writing assignments because they don't have time to grade? We have technology today in experimental form that will be able to grade essays using a machine learning technology.</p><p end="3203" is_meta="false" speaker="Rebecca Schuman" start="3137">I mean, I don't like grading essays. I wrote a very popular article in Slate about how I would like to stop assigning them because I don't like grading them. But when I grade them, I do grade them pretty fast. Essay grading technology is not very good right now.</p><p end="3203" is_meta="false" speaker="Rebecca Schuman" start="3137">It might get better, but, I mean, when I think about the idea that a robot can replace the nine years of post-college higher education that I had, doing my Ph.D., reading 13 hours a day, learning breadth and depth, really just piercing into the inner depths of my brain and scraping around inside it, I have to confront that technological possibility with sheer terror. I don't know if I want to be in a world where a robot can do what I have worked so hard and sacrificed so much and trained so much to do.</p><p end="3203" is_meta="false" speaker="Rebecca Schuman" start="3137">I know, but -- Anyone who can [unintelligible]</p><p end="3257" is_meta="false" speaker="Rebecca Schuman" start="3203">Of having a robot grade their papers?</p><p end="3257" is_meta="false" speaker="Rebecca Schuman" start="3203">They&#8217;d learn how to game the robot immediately.</p><p end="3257" is_meta="false" speaker="Jonathan Cole" start="3203">But the point is not simply writing papers. Even the most conservative organization in the world, the college board and the SAT, are giving up the essay part of the SAT examinations, because they are doing the grading by rote, in effect. They're not nuanced. They're not teaching students how to think for themselves independently,</p><p end="3257" is_meta="false" speaker="Jonathan Cole" start="3203">which is a very difficult thing to do. Now maybe it is doable through technology, but I haven't seen it demonstrated.</p><p end="3257" is_meta="false" speaker="Ben Nelson" start="3203">Well, and again, I do think that we're ratholing on a piece of content. I happen to agree with you both. I mean, I do think that at the very high levels of education you do want people who are expert in the subject to grade essays. That has nothing to do about where the class occurs.</p><p end="3322" is_meta="false" speaker="Ben Nelson" start="3257">To say the professor doesn't sit in front of a lecture hall or even a 10-person class and says hold on a second while I read this paper and grade it, that's not a very interactive format. It's not very engaging. And so the question is what is the cost structure that is going to be built around actually disseminating that education? Even in a small format.</p><p end="3322" is_meta="false" speaker="Ben Nelson" start="3257">Even in the scenario we believe in. What you actually do want is very tight student/faculty interaction, 15- to 19-person classes. We still opt to use chronology to facilitate the goings on in the classroom, because we think that it can enhance the experience for the student and dramatically lower the cost where you don't need tobuild buildings and maintain campuses when you can gather the students and have them experience what the world has to offer as opposed to necessarily in a very expensive, very exclusive campus environment.</p><p end="3322" is_meta="false" speaker="Jonathan Cole" start="3257">Well, I mean first of all, I think that, you know, educators have done a terrible job,</p><p end="3322" is_meta="false" speaker="Jonathan Cole" start="3257">especially at the selective colleges dealing with the issue of costs.</p><p end="3379" is_meta="false" speaker="Jonathan Cole" start="3322">I mean, students at Harvard graduate with no debt. They have a tremendous endowment. Columbia College students graduate with about $6,000 worth of debt, but the sticker price is the only thing that is talked about. So it's not as if those who can't afford it who come from, you know, poor socio-economic backgrounds can't go to these great colleges. I think as a conflation, however, if I can switch a bit, what the purposes are of these MOOCs. Are they to democratize the world as it were, which in some ways may well be hegemonic, who owns knowledge, to reach hundreds of thousands of people? Or is it to hold seminars in a different way with 16 or 17 people? Those are very different types of issues and questions. It seems to me Ben is trying to do one thing and it seems to me that edX is trying to do something slightly different.</p><p end="3436" is_meta="false" speaker="Anant Agarwal" start="3379">Well, absolutely. I think there are different ways of using technology in the classroom.</p><p end="3436" is_meta="false" speaker="Anant Agarwal" start="3379">Every click is not the same. And Ben is using clicks in one way, we're using clicks in another way. I think the point here, the debate is about more clicks and fewer bricks.</p><p end="3436" is_meta="false" speaker="Anant Agarwal" start="3379">Can we include the classroom experience? Can we include the way we teach students?</p><p end="3436" is_meta="false" speaker="Anant Agarwal" start="3379">Can we teach more students than can have access to a great Rebecca? [unintelligible]</p><p end="3436" is_meta="false" speaker="Anant Agarwal" start="3379">Can we create using technology the approach where people can learn from each other through peer learning online? Can we access -- can we increase educational access to millions of more students around the world who just don't have access to the Rebecca's of the world?</p><p end="3514" is_meta="false" speaker="Anant Agarwal" start="3436">I'm referring to all the children and students who cannot afford college or that leave college with huge amounts of debt or that simply don't have access to college.</p><p end="3514" is_meta="false" speaker="Jonathan Cole" start="3436">And that's a wonderful aim and a wonderful objective that I actually fully endorse, but the evidence that I've seen, and it's bad -- you know, it's not particularly good evidence,</p><p end="3514" is_meta="false" speaker="Jonathan Cole" start="3436">empirical evidence, suggests that the people in remote places that can't get to MIT,</p><p end="3514" is_meta="false" speaker="Jonathan Cole" start="3436">can't get to, you know, Amherst or Williams or wherever it might be, are people who are already educated. They're the ones who are signing on to these courses and may well be enjoying them, but it's not reaching the population yet that I think would have, you know, it would have very beneficial [unintelligible].</p><p end="3514" is_meta="false" speaker="Anant Agarwal" start="3436">Again, I think it's how you play the numbers. So we have 2.2 million learners on edX and of that, 30 percent of the 600,000 are high school and college students. And so just because 70 percent of learners already have a degree doesn't mean that you are still not reaching -- they're reaching more students at the college age and high school level today than the largest university in the United States.</p><p end="3563" is_meta="false" speaker="Anant Agarwal" start="3514">And so we cannot -- so we really cannot say that we're not reaching students in the right demographic. We are.</p><p end="3563" is_meta="false" speaker="Ben Nelson" start="3514">And I would add to Anant's point that if these universities would actually issue a degree alongside with that, you wouldn't have 600,000 students, you'd have 60 million. Thatone of the reasons that people don't complete is the same reason that people who sometimes read a textbook from cover to cover decide, hmm, I got to chapter 5. That was good enough. Thank you. But there is no point except for interest right now.</p><p end="3563" is_meta="false" speaker="Rebecca Schuman" start="3514">Well, you know, yes, I think that it does -- the numbers are -- it does reach more people than not having it would reach.</p><p end="3623" is_meta="false" speaker="Rebecca Schuman" start="3563">But I -- again, I agree with Jonathan that it doesn't necessarily reach the kind of people that it had originally intended to reach. And that shows in the corporate directions of edX's two main competitors, Coursera and Udacity, both of whom have decided to concentrate on corporate training instead of the sort of loftier democratization of education. And it also comes at the expense of people like me. There -- you know, you -</p><p end="3623" is_meta="false" speaker="Rebecca Schuman" start="3563">- I love that you think that I'm irreplaceable and that everybody should just be in my class, but I am not that special. There are literally over a million low-level professors just like me in the United States right now desperate to reach students, desperate to work,</p><p end="3623" is_meta="false" speaker="Rebecca Schuman" start="3563">working for --</p><p end="3623" is_meta="false" speaker="Rebecca Schuman" start="3563">Well, I guess we go from working for poverty level wages to working for no wages.</p><p end="3623" is_meta="false" speaker="Rebecca Schuman" start="3563">We're extinct.</p><p end="3623" is_meta="false" speaker="Ben Nelson" start="3563">I disagree.</p><p end="3623" is_meta="false" speaker="Anant Agarwal" start="3563">I think that I would completely disagree.</p><p end="3623" is_meta="false" speaker="Rebecca Schuman" start="3563">[unintelligible] true.</p><p end="3623" is_meta="false" speaker="Anant Agarwal" start="3563">-- is a rising tide that will lift all boats.</p><p end="3678" is_meta="false" speaker="Anant Agarwal" start="3623">Give you an example of Professor Jamie L&#8217;heureux. She teaches at Bunker Hill Community College in Massachusetts. And what she did was her students did not have access to a great computer science class, so she took the online material from one of her introductory computer science classes, and she used that in a blended model in the community class. And she said, if not for the online material from the edX course, she said she never would have been able to teach that course on her campus. And she also said she's irreplaceable. If not for her and her helping with the online material, the students would not have passed the course. So I think teachers are necessary. I think bringing online learning into the classroom can really up-level the whole educational experience.</p><p end="3678" is_meta="false" speaker="Rebecca Schuman" start="3623">I think you're expecting too much of administration. I think if they have the opportunity to get rid of pretty much all professors, type in MOOCs from super professors and then use low-paid adjuncts and TAs to basically proctor people, they would jump at that.</p><p end="3678" is_meta="false" speaker="Rebecca Schuman" start="3623">They would do that in a second.</p><p end="3756" is_meta="false" speaker="Rebecca Schuman" start="3678">Maybe not at super elite institutions like this one, but at the regional and directional universities where the vast majority of Americans earn their degrees, I just can't see that not happening because it would help the bottom line so much.</p><p end="3756" is_meta="false" speaker="Ben Nelson" start="3678">It would not happen when the supply and demand comes back in balance. Right now,</p><p end="3756" is_meta="false" speaker="Ben Nelson" start="3678">too much supply of professors, not enough supply of completing students. A lot of students desire to complete drop out because we don't track their progress. We don't know when we lose them until the final grade.</p><p end="3756" is_meta="false" speaker="Ben Nelson" start="3678">In the future, we'll be able to do that, and therefore there'll be much more demand for adjuncts and therefore salaries will rise.</p><p end="3799" is_meta="false" speaker="Ben Nelson" start="3756">So I believe that there are different kinds of subject matter that lend itself to different format of student faculty ratios. But the question about whether or not technology can assist, whether it is a large lecture, a small seminar, even a one-on-one tutorial in many cases is clear. Now --</p><p end="3799" is_meta="false" speaker="Ben Nelson" start="3756">Well, there are creative poetry classes online. And both in lecture format and as well as not. And let me tell you --</p><p end="3858" is_meta="false" speaker="Ben Nelson" start="3799">It's amazing. I think it's phenomenal. I mean, it -- but I'm biased in that answer. I'll tell you where I don't think that online instruction can compare with off line, even though it already is happening. In conservatory instruction, if you are training someone to be a pianist, training someone to be a violinist, very hard to deliver at a very professional level, not Suzuki method -- very hard to get that level of nuance and personal guidance -</p><p end="3858" is_meta="false" speaker="Ben Nelson" start="3799">-</p><p end="3858" is_meta="false" speaker="Ben Nelson" start="3799">John Donvan:All right. So I just want to go the side on the -- the other side. So your opponents have argued that there is a small sector of material that doesn't lend itself. You have conceded, I think, that there is -- there are areas that would lend themselves to online learning. Jonathan Cole?</p><p end="3921" is_meta="false" speaker="Jonathan Cole" start="3858">Well, I certainly do, and that's why the University of Phoenix exists, to raise human capital to the point where some people can get better jobs than they have. And there's no reason why those kinds of enterprises shouldn't exist. I would simply like to raise again, for my worthy opponents, the answer to the empirical questions that I raised at the very beginning: What's the cost model that will work that didn't work in the 1990s?</p><p end="3921" is_meta="false" speaker="Jonathan Cole" start="3858">And the various other issues that have to do with intellectual property and the rest. If you don't answer those questions, you're living off the future.</p><p end="3921" is_meta="false" speaker="Anant Agarwal" start="3858">Let me address the economic --</p><p end="3921" is_meta="false" speaker="Anant Agarwal" start="3858">-- model question that you raised. In fact, I think you made an argument against yourself. So you said that MOOCs cost between a hundred and $300,000 to create.</p><p end="3921" is_meta="false" speaker="Anant Agarwal" start="3858">You're absolutely right. They cost between $10,000 and half a million dollars to create.</p><p end="3921" is_meta="false" speaker="Anant Agarwal" start="3858">But the second time you offer the MOOC, you bring that into your classroom. The third time, the fourth time, it's like a textbook. A text-- [spelled phonetically] for someone who's written a textbook, it took me five years to write the textbook.</p><p end="3982" is_meta="false" speaker="Anant Agarwal" start="3921">But then to stamp out a new textbook is, you know, is 50 bucks or a hundred bucks. So repeating is much easier. And the MOOCs and online education, that&#8217;s how it is, the repetition is very cost effective and very high quality. However, in the classroom, I'm not sure what they pay -- you know, professors at Columbia or other universities, but I know it's not $14,000. It's certainly on the order of a hundred to $300,000. So in other words, we are teaching -- or we are paying a hundred to $300,000 each time a course is repeated. So therefore, the existing model is broken. With MOOCs, we can fix that,</p><p end="3982" is_meta="false" speaker="Anant Agarwal" start="3921">where the cost of creation is high, but the repetition, that's how you get the scaling of --</p><p end="4039" is_meta="false" speaker="Jonathan Cole" start="3982">I must say that you have given me the perfect reason for retiring faculty. They make their MOOC, and they leave the door, and you don't have to pay them again next year.</p><p end="4039" is_meta="false" speaker="Jonathan Cole" start="3982">Now, if they make two MOOCs, who owns the property?</p><p end="4039" is_meta="false" speaker="Anant Agarwal" start="3982">So the first point about retiring faculty after they create a MOOC, of course not. They have to be involved in --</p><p end="4039" is_meta="false" speaker="Anant Agarwal" start="3982">Exactly. So that would be the self-fulfilling prophecy.</p><p end="4039" is_meta="false" speaker="Anant Agarwal" start="3982">Exactly. So you make a MOOC, and then you have to support the MOOC. You teach the students. But you're not spending a hundred and $300,000 each time you teach it.</p><p end="4039" is_meta="false" speaker="Anant Agarwal" start="3982">You're still teaching it. You're still involved, but to a lesser extent.</p><p end="4039" is_meta="false" speaker="Anant Agarwal" start="3982">The intellectual property is very straight forward. Actually, I don't see what the issue is.</p><p end="4039" is_meta="false" speaker="Anant Agarwal" start="3982">The courses and content, it's like -- we've addressed the problem with textbooks and other course content.</p><p end="4102" is_meta="false" speaker="Anant Agarwal" start="4039">So I frankly don't see an issue there. So I would have [to discuss with you off line as to what issue you're seeing with IP because there's a well-established model, and that's the same model that we work for online content.</p><p end="4102" is_meta="false" speaker="Jonathan Cole" start="4039">Do the professors own the intellectual property? Do they get whatever income might be available from the MOOCs that are commercial enterprises?</p><p end="4102" is_meta="false" speaker="Anant Agarwal" start="4039">So the textbooks, the IP's owned completely by the professor and the publisher.</p><p end="4102" is_meta="false" speaker="Anant Agarwal" start="4039">Universities are completely cut out from it. And in online education, I think they have the chance to save the university with universities having discussion where three stakeholders can share the IP, not just the publisher and the professor, but the professor, the university and in this case the publisher of the MOOC platform like edX.</p><p end="4102" is_meta="false" speaker="Anant Agarwal" start="4039">There can be a three-way sharing of IP, which I think is the right way of doing as opposed to the textbook model.</p><p end="4159" is_meta="false" speaker="Ben Nelson" start="4102">Well, I --</p><p end="4159" is_meta="false" speaker="Ben Nelson" start="4102">-- I'm delighted to address that. This debate is not about research. It is about the dissemination of knowledge. It's only about the second part. And --</p><p end="4159" is_meta="false" speaker="Ben Nelson" start="4102">No, it is not.</p><p end="4159" is_meta="true" speaker="Ben Nelson" start="4102">laughter</p><p end="4159" is_meta="false" speaker="Ben Nelson" start="4102">I do think that what you enable when you remove the constriction of the campus environment from not just the student but from the professor is that you can enable much more flexible research.</p><p end="4229" is_meta="false" speaker="Ben Nelson" start="4159">I'll give you a couple of very quick examples. If you do field research, having a university job, we have to show up physically to class nine months out of the year, does not do wonders for your career, especially before you're tenured, or, like my father, who's a molecular biologist and is now doing structural biology, he needs to fly to the particle accelerators in Europe every three weeks just so he can shoot photons at his crystals.</p><p end="4229" is_meta="false" speaker="Ben Nelson" start="4159">Well, if he were still teaching -- he's emeritus, so he doesn't -- he wouldn't be able to do that, so -- at least in an offline environment. So research can also be dramatically helped by the removal of physical requirements -- physical presence requirements for the faculty.</p><p end="4229" is_meta="false" speaker="Ben Nelson" start="4159">John Donvan:What do you think of that, Rebecca, which -- I mean, it doesn't apply specifically to the kind of teaching that you're doing, but you would have a -- you would have the ability,</p><p end="4229" is_meta="false" speaker="Ben Nelson" start="4159">for example, to travel and study and do sabbaticals, et cetera, and still teach. Do you like that?</p><p end="4229" is_meta="false" speaker="Rebecca Schuman" start="4159">I mean, I think --</p><p end="4229" is_meta="false" speaker="Rebecca Schuman" start="4159">For me it sounds great because I'll never have a sabbatical anyway, but I think the few people in my discipline who are left on a tenure track would probably have a heart attack because they'd be like, "Oh, I would have to coincide my sabbatical with teaching."</p><p end="4277" is_meta="false" speaker="Rebecca Schuman" start="4229">Yeah, I mean, I have to say with that -- that is so esoteric, but I guess in an esoteric way I don't disagree with the opposite side on this particular thing.</p><p end="4277" is_meta="false" speaker="Jonathan Cole" start="4229">I do disagree. I mean, I --</p><p end="4277" is_meta="false" speaker="Jonathan Cole" start="4229">-- I'm not at all sure that you have a university if you were [unintelligible] that the sole function of that university in terms of bricks rather than clicks -- although clicks will exist in it -- is the research mission and all of the students are basically no longer there. Now,</p><p end="4277" is_meta="false" speaker="Jonathan Cole" start="4229">the essence of our great universities and our great colleges, whether they're very large state universities or much smaller ones, is that they create knowledge. They create discoveries and inventions.</p><p end="4346" is_meta="false" speaker="Jonathan Cole" start="4277">I don't see how taking students out of the laboratory is going to enhance that process since they are the people -- the students -- the postdocs and others, the post-doctoral fellows, they are often doing the bench research and learning from each other through close interaction. You take all the undergraduates away and there are no bricks, I'm not sure what kind of university is left.</p><p end="4346" is_meta="false" speaker="Jonathan Cole" start="4277">John Donvan:Let me -- let me just say this, and I'll bring the question back to you. I want to remind you that we're in the question and answer section of this Intelligence Squared U.S.</p><p end="4346" is_meta="false" speaker="Jonathan Cole" start="4277">Debate. I'm John Donvan, your moderator. We have four debaters, two teams of two,</p><p end="4346" is_meta="false" speaker="Jonathan Cole" start="4277">debating this motion, "More Clicks, Fewer Bricks: The Lecture Hall is Obsolete." And the point was just made by Jonathan Cole that a world where universities devolve into institutions that basically do research and all of the undergraduates are off campus,</p><p end="4346" is_meta="false" speaker="Jonathan Cole" start="4277">online, is not a university that he would call a university. Anant, do you want to respond to that?</p><p end="4346" is_meta="false" speaker="Anant Agarwal" start="4277">Let's be very careful here. I think we're taking some of the best institutions in the world,</p><p end="4346" is_meta="false" speaker="Anant Agarwal" start="4277">some really high quality institutions, and tarring [spelled phonetically] the whole world with this utopian brush.</p><p end="4397" is_meta="false" speaker="Anant Agarwal" start="4346">The world is not like that. Most universities in the world are not research institutions.</p><p end="4397" is_meta="false" speaker="Anant Agarwal" start="4346">Most colleges in the world, community colleges in the world, and high schools, and places where teaching happens are not research institutions. We happen to be in a research institution which is great. So I think we really need to look at the average, the median, and at universities around the world where education may be the predominant thing that happens. So I dream of a world where we have universities where professors are creating content and also disseminating content, just that they do it differently. It's the same people, but they do it differently. They do it bringing a lot online and so that they can spend a lot of time creating great content which they don't have the time to do because they have to do it every single semester. So now I can really create great content without a huge amount of effort and then focus on interacting with students in ways that I cannot do today.</p><p end="4458" is_meta="false" speaker="Ben Nelson" start="4397">I actually don't think it's very different at all. In fact, you can learn from what these companies are doing. If you look at where these companies set up 10 to 15 years ago,</p><p end="4458" is_meta="false" speaker="Ben Nelson" start="4397">they created campuses. Google has a campus and they said oh, we're going to provide everything you want here on the campus, free food and laundry and, you know, slides and things like that.</p><p end="4520" is_meta="false" speaker="Ben Nelson" start="4458">And guess what their employees said? We don't want to live on the campus. They want to live in the city. Open up an office in San Francisco. Open up offices in New York City.</p><p end="4520" is_meta="false" speaker="Ben Nelson" start="4458">Like, all right free food, that's great, but don't think you can re-create the world at huge cost and make it better than reality. So I think that's highly illustrative. I think that the more universities open, the more the university embraces the resources of the world and is open to students, whether they are their students or not, the more vibrant the physical elements of the university would become, like the research infrastructure, and the less university will start to compete -- or will continue to compete in an area like who has the better climbing gym.</p><p end="4645" is_meta="false" speaker="Anant Agarwal" start="4582">So again, I think online learning as we know it -- I really called it online learning 2.0,</p><p end="4645" is_meta="false" speaker="Anant Agarwal" start="4582">because the old style online learning, it really gave online learning a bad name, and I think [unintelligible] different today. Online learning today is completely different andyou should go check it out. We have online labs. We have discussion forums. The kind of things we can grade are simply [unintelligible]</p><p end="4645" is_meta="false" speaker="Anant Agarwal" start="4582">So if you assume this kind of quality of online learning -- I think at the end of the day it really depends on the content. If a great teacher created the online content or if a great teacher taught the in-person campus course and if the learner took one of the other and had a great experience and a degree, I would say that it shouldn't matter which one they did.</p><p end="4699" is_meta="false" speaker="Anant Agarwal" start="4645">I don't think so. I think if someone had enough money to pay for a completely campus experience and the same quality education they would have better soft skills, but I think the debate is about fewer bricks, more clicks, is the emphasis. So I think that on campuses to bring a lot more online learning, the blend of the online with soft skills and so on can be substantially better than anything they have on campus today.</p><p end="4820" is_meta="false" speaker="Jonathan Cole" start="4757">Well, I mean obviously -- it's a hypothetical and an interesting one. If more people had experience in producing these things, they might teach better courses. But we don't know. I mean, one of the problems that I have with this is that -- all of this -- is that it seems to me that there are many possibilities for technology and many ways in which technology can improve universities. But we don't know, for example, the answer to the question before, which is how do graduates of one form or another respond in terms of employment opportunities?</p><p end="4883" is_meta="false" speaker="Jonathan Cole" start="4820">We don't know very much about different learning styles. We have so little evidence that it seems to me what we're doing is we are essentially casting our fate to the wind and saying, look, this is a possibility, not necessarily a fact, because we don't have very much empirical evidence to demonstrate the case of our opponents.</p><p end="4936" is_meta="false" speaker="Anant Agarwal" start="4883">Well, I have to say, you know, there are some great statements from our colleagues. I would love to take a class from Rebecca. But this is not about comparing the absolute best that you can get in a particular kind of course against the online learning of yesteryear. I think we need to look at where is the average going to be? Where is the majority of the university, the classroom, the students going to be? And I think in Rebecca's case, she was able to recite the names of 15 of her students. In my case, it would take me forever to recite the names of 155,000 students that got something out of that course. But I will tell you -- very quickly about three students. Deward Mukendi [spelled phonetically]. He came up from a family of 14 from the Democratic republic of Congo. He goes to the University of Cape Town to learn computer science. In his first year, his father passes away.</p><p end="5004" is_meta="false" speaker="Anant Agarwal" start="4936">He can't pay his tuition anymore, and so he goes off into the world, and he's been working for ten years. Now that online learning is available, he is going back to study,</p><p end="5004" is_meta="false" speaker="Anant Agarwal" start="4936">and he's taking these MOOCs, and he's learning. And he's saying, "I'm going to get a better job because of the kind of learning that I'm doing." I can give you name after name, Omobavay [spelled phonetically] 15-year-old student from [unintelligible] in India, took my course, did really well. He applied to MIT, and he got into MIT, now he's a sophomore at MIT. And at MIT, two out of three students today compared to virtually zero two years ago are now doing blended online learning. MIT moved into this in a big way. They're blending the classroom with a lot of online technology. So 2800 out of 4500 students at MIT are now using the edX platform on campus in a blended model.</p><p end="5004" is_meta="false" speaker="Anant Agarwal" start="4936">And this is just two years old. I think if we look at where the average is going to be, I think things are going to be very different going ahead. So I would like you to think about the average student in all the world in terms of where universities should be and given that, I really urge you to think about more clicks, fewer bricks in terms of increasing access and also improving the quality of education on our campuses.</p><p end="5061" is_meta="false" speaker="Anant Agarwal" start="5004">Thank you.</p><p end="5061" is_meta="false" speaker="Anant Agarwal" start="5004">John Donvan:Our motion is, "More clicks, fewer bricks: The lecture hall is obsolete." And here to summarize his position against this motion, Jonathan Cole. He is the John Mitchell Mason professor at Columbia University.</p><p end="5061" is_meta="false" speaker="Jonathan Cole" start="5004">Those of you among the jury sitting out there, consider closely whether my worthy opponents here -- I think they've made very interesting cases -- are espousing what is in fact fact, what is fiction, or what is wishful thinking. Let me conclude with three anecdotes. A while ago, I offered a course in law, science and society. It was designed to challenge the presuppositions and biases of the students. Frankly, it was designed to be both challenging and unsettling. At the end of the semester, one of my very smart students said to me, "I loved this course, the debates we had and the people I met. But every time I left this class, I had a headache.</p><p end="5120" is_meta="false" speaker="Jonathan Cole" start="5061">Not knowing quite what I believed in any longer." and I said, "Sam, those headaches are a great thing. It shows that you were really thinking hard. And those debates and those doubts you had are an essential part of learning." no set of clicks will replace students'</p><p end="5120" is_meta="false" speaker="Jonathan Cole" start="5061">experience. Then there are the extremely popular courses at Stanford's D school, an institute for design innovation, where one of the assignments was to rethink how people eat Ramen noodles or an assignment that led to a news reading app that was bought by LinkedIn" for $90 million. The students came from every field, sciences,</p><p end="5120" is_meta="false" speaker="Jonathan Cole" start="5061">engineering, social sciences, et cetera. The students were taught by David Kelly, one of the school's founders. And they were invited to really think of developing empathy muscles. They were also taught to forego computer screens and spreadsheets and focus on people.</p><p end="5181" is_meta="false" speaker="Jonathan Cole" start="5120">At the D school, says Kelly, we learn by doing. Sounds a lot like John Dugas's [spelled phonetically] philosophy brought back to being. It's a huge success with students churning out dozens of innovative products and startups.</p><p end="5181" is_meta="false" speaker="Jonathan Cole" start="5120">Two minutes go by so fast.</p><p end="5181" is_meta="false" speaker="Jonathan Cole" start="5120">John Donvan:They do. Our motion is "more clicks, fewer bricks: The lecture hall is obsolete." And here to summarize his position supporting this motion, Ben Nelson, founder, chairman and CEO of the Minerva Project.</p><p end="5181" is_meta="false" speaker="Ben Nelson" start="5120">I wouldn't want to end this debate without getting into the facts that Jonathan so desperately wanted us to get to. So I'll give you two facts. One fact is what we actually know, not about online education, but about off line education, not at the community college, not at a state university, but at our most illustrious universities. Professor at Harvard University, Eric Mazur who teaches physics wanted to know how much his students retained from his physics classes.</p><p end="5245" is_meta="false" speaker="Ben Nelson" start="5181">So he surveyed them two years after the end of the course. You know what their retention rate was? 10 percent. The question isn't as much whether or not online education is effective, is it can&#8217;t possibly be any worse than the existing model?</p><p end="5245" is_meta="true" speaker="Ben Nelson" start="5181">laughter</p><p end="5245" is_meta="false" speaker="Ben Nelson" start="5181">In fact, even when you give students a choice, as was done with the very first MOOC,</p><p end="5245" is_meta="false" speaker="Ben Nelson" start="5181">one offered by Sebastian Thrune at Stanford University. Sebastian Thrune is a celebrity.</p><p end="5298" is_meta="false" speaker="Rebecca Schuman" start="5245">Thank you. I just want to go on the record that Anant thinks I am the best at teaching.</p><p end="5298" is_meta="false" speaker="Rebecca Schuman" start="5245">I'm going to put that in all of my review portfolios. So I want to talk a little bit about my class again, not naming them, but I'm talking about what we did this week. So I don'tlecture. My room is a seminar room not a lecture hall. And this week we're reading "Things Fall Apart," by Chinua Achebe, one of my favorite books, one of the greatest books of all time.</p><p end="5359" is_meta="false" speaker="Rebecca Schuman" start="5298">And our activity this week was about proverbs from the Igbo culture and how they figure into the narration of the book. And so one of those problems is looking at a King&#8217;s mouth, one would think that he never sucked at his mother's breast. And I said to my class, "This is a very evocative proverb, very provocative, what do you think it means in relation to the protagonist, Okonkwo&#8217;s struggle with his masculinity?" And I just called on a student at random because I like doing that -- it's fun -- and he said, "uh, I don&#8217;t know, you should never forget where you came from?" And I said, "Okay, that's a start. Let's do it." So we went back and forth in the class, me back to him, other students to him, other students to me. If you want to know how it turned out, you're going to have to come to my class, but the point is that most of the students in the class had never thought about that proverb like that before. They had never thought about it at all. This was a moment that we created together. This was a moment we created together in real time, face-to-face, in the same room with energy you could feel, with energy between people that you could feel, and that changed us all just a little bit.</p><p end="5419" is_meta="false" speaker="Rebecca Schuman" start="5359">The second part of this motion is that the lecture hall is obsolete, and it's certainly true that in a thousand-person lecture, that kind of moment that you can feel is few and far between, but I don't think the answer is to put that lecture online in five-minute chunks.</p><p end="5419" is_meta="false" speaker="Rebecca Schuman" start="5359">And I don't necessarily think it's to get rid of the classroom altogether for some fascinating sounding space technology of the future that I haven't seen yet, which sounds great. So that's why I hope that you will join our team in voting, "No," on the motion, "More Clicks, Fewer Bricks: The Lecture Hall is Obsolete." Thank you.</p><p end="5599" is_meta="false" speaker="Jonathan Cole" start="5538">I'm sure everyone's going to go to it, yes.</p><p end="5599" is_meta="true" speaker="Jonathan Cole" start="5538">laughter</p><p end="5662" is_meta="false" speaker="Jonathan Cole" start="5599">I appreciate the sentiment. I really do.</p></transcript></debate>
